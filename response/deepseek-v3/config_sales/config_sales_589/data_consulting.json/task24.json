                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio and how to calculate it based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Liabilities:** This is the sum of all liabilities. In the given balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" we see \"End_amount\" is 829,755.77. There are no non-current liabilities listed, so total liabilities = 829,755.77.\n- **Total Assets:** The \"Total Assets\" at the end is 15,023,526.85.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{829,755.77}{15,023,526.85} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{829,755.77}{15,023,526.85} \\approx 0.0552 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.06\n\nWait a minute, but in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as 0.14, which seems higher. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, under \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity,\" the \"End_amount\" is 15,023,526.85, which matches \"Total Assets.\" The liabilities are indeed under \"Total Current Liabilities\" as 829,755.77. There's no separate line for long-term liabilities, so total liabilities should be just current liabilities.\n\nBut in the example, the calculation was:\nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nTotal Assets: 13,216,409.49\nRatio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14\n\nSimilarly here:\n829,755.77 / 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.055\n\nMaybe the example had more liabilities not listed separately. Here, it seems correct to take only the current liabilities since that's all that's provided.\n\nSo, Debt to Asset Ratio ≈ 0.06\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet shows:\n- Accounts Payable: 545,000\n- Taxes Payable: 284,755.77\nTotal Current Liabilities: 829,755.77\n\nNo other liabilities are listed, so total liabilities = 829,755.77.\n\nThus, Debt to Asset Ratio = 829,755.77 / 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.055 or 0.06 when rounded.\n\nBut the example had a similar structure and got 0.14. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the \"Total Liabilities\" include both current and non-current, but here non-current liabilities aren't listed, so it's just current.\n\nGiven that, I think it's correct to proceed with 0.06.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -224,133.22\n- **Net Income (from Income Statement):** 1,193,771.08\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-224,133.22}{1,193,771.08} \\]\n\nThis gives a negative ratio, which is unusual because typically you'd expect positive cash flow from operations relative to net income. But the numbers are what they are.\n\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\frac{-224,133.22}{1,193,771.08} \\approx -0.1877 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -0.19\n\nBut in the example, the ratio was positive (4.41), even though Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities was negative (-7,259,994.10) and Net Income was negative (-1,645,141.43), leading to a positive ratio (negative divided by negative).\n\nHere, negative divided by positive gives negative.\n\nIs this correct? Let me check the example again:\n\nExample:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\nNet Income: -1,645,141.43\nRatio: -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nHere:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -224,133.22\nNet Income: 1,193,771.08\nRatio: -224,133.22 / 1,193,771.08 ≈ -0.19\n\nYes, that seems correct based on the numbers.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.19'} }\n```\n\n**Wait a second**, looking back at the Debt to Asset Ratio calculation, maybe I should consider that the \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" equals \"Total Assets,\" and \"Total Owner's Equity\" is 14,193,771.08, so:\n\nTotal Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Total Owner's Equity\n= 15,023,526.85 - 14,193,771.08\n= 829,755.77\n\nWhich matches the \"Total Current Liabilities.\" So, no other liabilities are present. Thus, Debt to Asset Ratio is indeed 0.055 or 0.06.\n\nSimilarly, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is correctly calculated as -0.19 based on the given numbers.\n\nHowever, in financial analysis, a negative ratio here might indicate that even though the company has positive net income, its operating cash flow is negative, which could be a concern. But mathematically, the calculation seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.19'} }\n```",
