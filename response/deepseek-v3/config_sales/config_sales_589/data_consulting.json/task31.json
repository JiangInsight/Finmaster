                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all revenue is credit sales) = Main Business Revenue = 5,695,115.02\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (from initial balance sheet)\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 1,562,598.26\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**\n\\[ \\text{Average AR} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning AR} + \\text{Ending AR}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 1,562,598.26}{2} = 781,299.13 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{AR Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,695,115.02}{781,299.13} \\approx 7.29 \\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -224,133.22\n- Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-224,133.22}{829,755.77} \\approx -0.27 \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems to be the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided. So, it's the same calculation.\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = -0.27 \\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales = Total Revenue = 5,695,115.02\n- Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 15,023,526.85\n\n**Average Total Assets:**\n\\[ \\text{Average TA} = \\frac{13,000,000.00 + 15,023,526.85}{2} = \\frac{28,023,526.85}{2} = 14,011,763.425 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,695,115.02}{14,011,763.425} \\approx 0.41 \\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed)\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = 14,193,771.08\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{829,755.77}{14,193,771.08} \\approx 0.058 \\]\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity, which is correct. Here, Total Liabilities are only the current liabilities since no long-term liabilities are mentioned.\n\nBut in the balance sheet, \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" is equal to \"Total Assets\", and \"Total Owner's Equity\" is given separately. So, Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nTotal Assets = 15,023,526.85  \nTotal Owner's Equity = 14,193,771.08  \nTotal Liabilities = 15,023,526.85 - 14,193,771.08 = 829,755.77\n\nThis matches the current liabilities, so the calculation is correct.\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{829,755.77}{14,193,771.08} \\approx 0.058 \\]\n\nBut in the example, it was rounded to two decimal places, so let's keep it as 0.06.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.29', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.27', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.27', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.41', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nComparing with the example:\n- AR Turnover: Higher here (7.29 vs. 4.47) â€“ makes sense as sales are higher relative to AR.\n- Operating cash flow ratios are negative but less severe (-0.27 vs. -3.90).\n- Total Asset Turnover is the same (0.41), which is interesting but could be coincidental based on the numbers.\n- Debt to Equity is lower here (0.06 vs. 0.16), indicating less debt relative to equity.\n\nEverything seems consistent with the given data.",
