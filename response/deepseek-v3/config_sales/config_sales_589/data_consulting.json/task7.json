Since this is an outflow, it is already reflected as a negative value in the Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities (-106,218.20). Therefore, we subtract this amount from the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities.\n   \n   However, in practice, FCF is typically calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures}\n   \\]\n   Here, the Capital Expenditures are the absolute value of the purchase of fixed assets (106,218.20), but since the Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities is already -106,218.20, we can directly use the Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents to verify the FCF.\n\n3. **Verify with Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents is -330,351.42. This represents the total change in cash, which is the sum of Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities and Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Increase} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} + \\text{Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -330,351.42 = -224,133.22 + (-106,218.20)\n   \\]\n   This confirms that the FCF is equal to the Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents, which is -330,351.42.\n\nThus, the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is -330,351.42.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-330351.42'} }\n```",
