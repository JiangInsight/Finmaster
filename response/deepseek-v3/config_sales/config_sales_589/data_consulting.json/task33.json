                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -224,133.22\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -224,133.22 / 829,755.77 ≈ -0.27\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities are:\n- Accounts Payable = 545,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 284,755.77\nTotal Current Liabilities = 829,755.77 (which seems to be the total debt as there are no long-term liabilities listed)\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -224,133.22 / 829,755.77 ≈ -0.27\n\n*Wait a minute, this is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. Maybe \"Debt\" here refers to total liabilities, which is the same as current liabilities in this case since there are no non-current liabilities listed.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 3,085,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- End Inventory = 720,000.00\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 720,000) / 2 = 360,000\n\nCalculation:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 3,085,000 / 360,000 ≈ 8.57\n\n*Hmm, the example had a much lower ratio. Maybe I should check if the initial inventory is indeed zero or if I missed something. The initial inventory is listed as 0.00, so the calculation seems correct.*\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77 (as total debt)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,193,771.08\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08 ≈ 0.058\n\n*This seems quite low compared to the example's 0.16. Maybe \"Total Debt\" includes all liabilities, which is just current liabilities here, so it's correct.*\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 9,963,057.95\n- Inventory = 720,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Assets = 9,963,057.95 - 720,000.00 = 9,243,057.95\nQuick Ratio = 9,243,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 11.14\n\n*This seems very high compared to the example's 1.54. Maybe I should exclude more items from current assets? Typically, quick assets are cash, marketable securities, and receivables. Let's recalculate:*\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 3,730,866.78 + 3,938,781.80 + 10,811.11 + 1,562,598.26 = 9,243,057.95\nSame as above, since inventory is already excluded from these. Maybe the initial calculation is correct, and the company is very liquid.\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 9,963,057.95\n- Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,963,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 12.01\n\nAgain, very high, but based on the numbers, this seems correct.\n\n### Reviewing the Example:\nLooking back at the example:\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Cash Flow to Debt Ratio were the same (-3.90), which aligns with my calculations where both ratios were the same (-0.27).\n- Inventory Turnover was 1.73 in the example, mine is higher at 8.57, possibly due to higher COGS relative to average inventory.\n- Debt to Equity was 0.16 in the example, mine is lower at 0.058, indicating less debt.\n- Quick and Current Ratios were much higher in my case, suggesting the company is very liquid in this scenario.\n\nGiven that all calculations seem mathematically correct based on the provided data, here's the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.27', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.27', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '8.57', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Quick Ratio': '11.14', 'Current Ratio': '12.01'}}\n```\n\n*Note: I rounded Debt to Equity to 0.06 for consistency with decimal places, though the precise calculation is ~0.058.*",
