In this case, it's -224,133.22.\n\n2. **Identify Total Debt**: Total debt is the sum of all liabilities. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" which is 829,755.77. There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so total debt is 829,755.77.\n\n3. **Calculate the Ratio**: The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated by dividing the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities by the Total Debt.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} = \\frac{-224,133.22}{829,755.77} \\approx -0.27\n   \\]\n\n4. **Round the Result**: The result is rounded to two decimal places, giving -0.27.\n\nHere is the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.27'} }\n```",
