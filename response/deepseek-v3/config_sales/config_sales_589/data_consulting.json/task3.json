                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Asset Ratio\nFirst, I need to understand what the Debt to Asset Ratio is. From what I recall, it's a financial metric that shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nThis ratio gives an idea of how much the company relies on debt to finance its assets. A higher ratio means more debt is used, which could indicate higher financial risk.\n\n### Identifying the Components from the Balance Sheet\nNow, let's look at the provided balance sheet to find the necessary numbers.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, we have:\n\n1. **Total Assets**: This is given directly in the table.\n   - At the end of the reporting period (2024-01-28), Total Assets = 15,023,526.85\n\n2. **Total Liabilities**: This isn't directly given as a single line item, but we can find it.\n   - Under liabilities, we have:\n     - Accounts Payable = 545,000.00\n     - Taxes Payable = 284,755.77\n     - Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n   - There's no mention of long-term liabilities in this table, so it seems the only liabilities are the current ones.\n   - Therefore, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check. \n\nLooking at the \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" line, it matches the \"Total Assets,\" which is good for the balance sheet to balance. \n\nTotal Liabilities and Owner's Equity = Total Liabilities + Total Owner's Equity\nGiven:\nTotal Liabilities and Owner's Equity = 15,023,526.85\nTotal Owner's Equity = 14,193,771.08\n\nSo, \nTotal Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Total Owner's Equity\n= 15,023,526.85 - 14,193,771.08\n= 829,755.77\n\nThis matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" figure, which confirms that there are no other liabilities besides the current ones listed.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{829,755.77}{15,023,526.85} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n829,755.77 ÷ 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.0552\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.055 or 5.5%.\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.14', which is a decimal representation, not a percentage. So, we'll keep it in decimal form.\n\n0.0552 rounded to two decimal places is 0.06.\n\nWait, let's calculate it more precisely:\n\n829,755.77 / 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.055229\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.06\n\nBut looking back at the example, their calculation was:\n\nTotal Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\nTotal Assets = 13,216,409.49\nRatio = 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14085, rounded to '0.14'\n\nSimilarly, in our case, it's 0.055, which is closer to 0.06 when rounded.\n\nBut let's see if we're missing anything. Is there any other debt not included in current liabilities? The table doesn't show any long-term liabilities, so it seems correct.\n\n### Verifying with Equity\nAnother way to think about it is that the equity is quite large compared to liabilities, which would make the ratio small. \n\nTotal Owner's Equity = 14,193,771.08\nTotal Liabilities = 829,755.77\nTotal Assets = 15,023,526.85\n\nIndeed, liabilities are much smaller than equity, leading to a low debt ratio.\n\n### Final Calculation\nSo, the precise calculation is:\n\n829,755.77 / 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.055229\n\nExpressed to two decimal places: 0.06\n\nBut to match the example's precision (which was to two decimal places without rounding up), maybe it's better to keep it as 0.06.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the example might have had more precise rounding (like rounding down from 0.14085 to 0.14), then 0.055229 would be 0.06.\n\nBut looking at the numbers, 0.055 is closer to 0.06 than to 0.05 when rounding to two decimal places.\n\nHowever, in financial contexts, sometimes more precision is preferred. Maybe we can present it as '0.06' to match the format.\n\nBut the example had '0.14', which is two decimal places, so we'll do the same.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{829,755.77}{15,023,526.85} \\approx 0.055 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.06\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06'} }\n```",
