                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,193,771.08\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08 ≈ 0.0585\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,193,771.08\n- Total Revenue = 5,695,115.02\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = 1,193,771.08 / 5,695,115.02 ≈ 0.2096 or 20.96%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:**  \nROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets  \n(Assuming we use ending total assets since beginning is not provided for average, but in the example, it seems they used ending total assets)\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets (End) = 15,023,526.85\n- Net Profit = 1,193,771.08\n\nCalculation:\nROA = 1,193,771.08 / 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.0795 or 7.95%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable  \n(Assuming all sales are credit sales since no info is given otherwise)\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (assumed as Net Credit Sales) = 5,695,115.02\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Accounts Receivable (End) = 1,562,598.26\n- Accounts Receivable (Initial) = 0.00\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,562,598.26) / 2 = 781,299.13\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover = 5,695,115.02 / 781,299.13 ≈ 7.29\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '20.96%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '7.95%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.29'}}\n```\n\n**Verification with Example:**\nLooking back at the example provided, their calculations seem to use ending balances for denominators without averaging (e.g., ROA uses ending total assets, AR turnover uses ending AR). If we follow that approach strictly:\n\n- AR Turnover = Revenue / Ending AR = 5,695,115.02 / 1,562,598.26 ≈ 3.65\nBut this contradicts the example where they used average (since initial AR was 0, average is half of ending, making their ratio higher). Given that initial AR is 0, using ending AR would halve the ratio, which seems incorrect. So, average is more appropriate here.\n\nSimilarly, for ROA, using ending assets seems standard unless average is specified. \n\nGiven that, my initial calculations seem correct except possibly AR turnover if strictly following the example's method. But methodologically, average is correct when beginning and ending are available.\n\nHowever, in the example:\nRevenue = 5,431,018.59\nEnd AR = 2,429,482.13\nInitial AR = 0\nAverage AR = 1,214,741.065\nAR Turnover = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47 (matches given solution)\nSo they used average.\n\nSimilarly for ROA:\nNet Profit = -1,645,141.43\nTotal Assets (End) = 13,216,409.49\nROA = -1,645,141.43 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ -0.1245 or -12.45% (close to given -12.55%, maybe rounding)\n\nSo my initial approach aligns with the example's method.\n\nThus, final ratios are correct as initially calculated.\n\n**Final Confirmed Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '20.96%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '7.95%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.29'}}\n```",
