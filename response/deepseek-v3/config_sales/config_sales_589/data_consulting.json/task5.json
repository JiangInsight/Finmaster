                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Gross Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"Gross Profit Margin\" means. From what I recall, the Gross Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods and services.\n\nThe formula for Gross Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n### Identifying the Necessary Values\n\nLooking at the provided income statement, I need to find:\n\n1. **Gross Profit**: This is directly given in the table as 2,610,115.02.\n2. **Total Revenue**: This is also given as 5,695,115.02.\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,610,115.02}{5,695,115.02} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide Gross Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2,610,115.02}{5,695,115.02} \\approx 0.4583 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.4583 \\times 100 \\approx 45.83\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n- Gross Profit: 2,610,115.02\n- Total Revenue: 5,695,115.02\n\nDivision:\n\n\\[ 2,610,115.02 \\div 5,695,115.02 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ 5,695,115.02 \\times 0.45 = 2,562,801.759 \\]\n\\[ 5,695,115.02 \\times 0.458 = 2,608,362.679 \\]\n\\[ 5,695,115.02 \\times 0.4583 \\approx 2,610,115.02 \\]\n\nYes, 0.4583 seems correct because:\n\n\\[ 0.4583 \\times 5,695,115.02 \\approx 2,610,115.02 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter performing the calculation and verifying it, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 45.83%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '45.83%'} }\n```",
