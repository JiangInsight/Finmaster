                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 829,755.77\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 15,023,526.85\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{829,755.77}{15,023,526.85} \\approx 0.0552 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.06 (but let's keep more precision for now).\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 2,610,115.02\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,695,115.02\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,610,115.02}{5,695,115.02} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 45.83\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -224,133.22\n- **Current Liabilities (from balance sheet):** 829,755.77\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-224,133.22}{829,755.77} \\approx -0.270 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -0.27\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, let's present these in the required JSON format with appropriate rounding and formatting:\n\n- **Debt to Asset Ratio:** 0.06 (or more precisely 0.055, but typically shown as two decimal places)\n- **Gross Profit Margin:** 45.83%\n- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:** -0.27\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was given as '0.14', which suggests that perhaps they included more liabilities or rounded differently. In our case, since only current liabilities are present, it's 829,755.77 / 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.055 or 0.06 when rounded.\n\nSimilarly, Gross Profit Margin was shown as '18.80%' in the example, but our calculation is higher at ~45.83%.\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio was '-3.90' in the example, ours is '-0.27'.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed with our calculations unless I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps in the example, they used average assets or liabilities? But the instructions seem to imply using end amounts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Debt to Asset Ratio includes all liabilities, but here we only have current liabilities, so it's the same.\n\nSimilarly, Operating Cash Flow Ratio is negative in both cases, just different magnitudes.\n\nGiven that, I think our calculations are correct based on the given data.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.83%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.27'} }\n```\n\nBut let me double-check the Debt to Asset Ratio calculation:\n\nTotal Liabilities = 829,755.77\nTotal Assets = 15,023,526.85\n\n829,755.77 / 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.0552, so 0.06 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nSimilarly, Gross Profit Margin:\n\n2,610,115.02 / 5,695,115.02 ≈ 0.4583 or 45.83%.\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio:\n\n-224,133.22 / 829,755.77 ≈ -0.270 or -0.27.\n\nSo, seems correct.\n\nHowever, the example had:\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio: '0.14' (higher)\nGross Profit Margin: '18.80%' (lower)\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio: '-3.90' (more negative)\n\nMaybe in the example, they used initial amounts or averages, but the problem seems to ask for end amounts.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with the calculations based on end amounts.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.83%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.27'} }\n```",
