                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 829,755.77\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so **Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 829,755.77**\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 14,193,771.08\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{829,755.77}{14,193,771.08} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{829,755.77}{14,193,771.08} \\approx 0.0585 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately **0.06**.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 1,193,771.08\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,695,115.02\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,193,771.08}{5,695,115.02} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,193,771.08}{5,695,115.02} \\approx 0.2096 \\]\n\\[ 0.2096 \\times 100\\% \\approx 20.96\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately **20.96%**.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -224,133.22 (negative value)\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 829,755.77 (from the balance sheet)\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{-224,133.22}{829,755.77} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-224,133.22}{829,755.77} \\approx -0.270 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is approximately **-0.27**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '20.96%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.27'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 829,755.77\n   - Equity: 14,193,771.08\n   - 829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08 ≈ 0.0585 → 0.06 (correct)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: 1,193,771.08\n   - Revenue: 5,695,115.02\n   - (1,193,771.08 / 5,695,115.02) * 100 ≈ 20.96% (correct)\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -224,133.22\n   - Current Liabilities: 829,755.77\n   - -224,133.22 / 829,755.77 ≈ -0.27 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out!",
