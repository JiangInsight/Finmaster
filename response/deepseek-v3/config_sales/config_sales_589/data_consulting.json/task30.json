                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 9,963,057.95\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 829,755.77\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,963,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 12.01\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 3,730,866.78\n- Bank Deposits = 3,938,781.80\n- Interest Receivable = 10,811.11\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,562,598.26\n- Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 3,730,866.78 + 3,938,781.80 + 10,811.11 + 1,562,598.26\n= 9,243,057.95\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,243,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 11.14\n\n*Wait a minute*, usually \"Quick Assets\" exclude Inventory but include Cash, Marketable Securities (like Bank Deposits), and Accounts Receivable. Interest Receivable is also typically included as it's expected to be received quickly. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, their Quick Ratio was lower than the Current Ratio because they had Inventory. Here, Inventory is 720,000, which is excluded in Quick Ratio. \n\nLet me re-sum Quick Assets:\nCash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 3,730,866.78 + 3,938,781.80 + 10,811.11 + 1,562,598.26\n= 9,243,057.95\n\nCurrent Assets = 9,963,057.95\nDifference is Inventory = 720,000 (which checks out: 9,963,057.95 - 720,000 = 9,243,057.95)\n\nSo Quick Ratio = 9,243,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 11.14\n\nThis seems high, but the numbers are correct based on the data.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities: Only Current Liabilities are given (829,755.77), no long-term liabilities mentioned.\n- Total Assets = 15,023,526.85\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 829,755.77 / 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.055 or 0.06\n\n*Wait*, is Total Liabilities only Current Liabilities here? The balance sheet shows \"Total Current Liabilities\" and no other liabilities, so it seems so.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 829,755.77\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,193,771.08\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08 ≈ 0.058 or 0.06\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -224,133.22\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 829,755.77\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -224,133.22 / 829,755.77 ≈ -0.27\n\n*But* in the example, they used \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" as the numerator, which seems correct. Here it's negative, so the ratio is negative.\n\n### Verifying with the Example:\nTheir solution was:\n{'Current Ratio': '4.27', 'Quick Ratio': '1.54', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.14', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.16', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-3.90'}\n\nTheir Cash Flow to Debt was negative, similar to ours here.\n\n### Final Calculations:\n1. Current Ratio = 9,963,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 12.01\n2. Quick Ratio = 9,243,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 11.14\n3. Debt to Asset Ratio = 829,755.77 / 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.06\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio = 829,755.77 / 14,193,771.08 ≈ 0.06\n5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -224,133.22 / 829,755.77 ≈ -0.27\n\n### Possible Rounding:\nThe example had ratios rounded to two decimal places, so I'll do the same.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '12.01', 'Quick Ratio': '11.14', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.27'} }\n```\n\n*Double-checking Quick Ratio:*\nCurrent Assets = 9,963,057.95\nInventory = 720,000\nQuick Assets = 9,963,057.95 - 720,000 = 9,243,057.95\nQuick Ratio = 9,243,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 11.14 (correct)\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly based on the provided data. The high Current and Quick Ratios indicate a very liquid position, with current assets significantly exceeding current liabilities. The low Debt ratios show minimal debt relative to assets and equity. The negative Cash Flow to Debt ratio indicates that operating cash flow was negative relative to debt, which could be a concern if persistent.",
