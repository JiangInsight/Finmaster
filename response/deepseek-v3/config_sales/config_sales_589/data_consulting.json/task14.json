                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the necessary data:**\n   - **Net Credit Sales (Revenue):** This is typically the \"Main Business Revenue\" from the income statement. In this case, it's $5,695,115.02.\n   - **Average Accounts Receivable:** This is calculated as the average of the beginning and ending accounts receivable. From the balance sheet:\n     - Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial_amount): $0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - Ending Accounts Receivable (End_amount): $1,562,598.26 (as of 2024-01-28)\n     - Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = ($0.00 + $1,562,598.26) / 2 = $781,299.13\n\n2. **Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:**\n   - The formula is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the numbers:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,695,115.02}{781,299.13} \\approx 7.29\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   - The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is approximately 7.29.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.29'}}\n```",
