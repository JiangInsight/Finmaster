                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Net Profit Margin is. From what I recall, the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. \n\nThe formula for Net Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSo, to calculate this, I need two numbers:\n1. Net Profit\n2. Total Revenue\n\n### Identifying the Numbers from the Given Data\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n1. **Total Revenue**: \n   - The table lists \"Total Revenue\" as 5,695,115.02.\n\n2. **Net Profit**: \n   - At the bottom, \"Net Profit\" is listed as 1,193,771.08.\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\n\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,193,771.08}{5,695,115.02} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,193,771.08}{5,695,115.02} \\approx 0.2096 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.2096 \\times 100 \\approx 20.96\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let's re-calculate:\n\n1,193,771.08 ÷ 5,695,115.02 ≈ 0.2096\n\n0.2096 × 100 = 20.96%\n\nSeems correct.\n\n### Checking the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure I'm doing it right:\n\nIn the example:\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n\nCalculation:\n(-1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59) × 100 ≈ -30.29%\n\nWhich matches the given solution of -30.29%. So, my method seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nFor the given problem:\n- Net Profit: 1,193,771.08\n- Total Revenue: 5,695,115.02\n\nNet Profit Margin ≈ 20.96%\n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '20.96%'} }\n```",
