                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 9,963,057.95\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 829,755.77\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 9,963,057.95 / 829,755.77 ≈ 12.01\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Definition:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 2,610,115.02\n- Total Revenue = 5,695,115.02\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (2,610,115.02 / 5,695,115.02) * 100 ≈ 45.83%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 829,755.77\n- Total Assets = 15,023,526.85\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 829,755.77 / 15,023,526.85 ≈ 0.055 or 5.5%\n\nWait a minute, the initial example had a Debt to Asset Ratio of 0.14, which seems to include only current liabilities as total liabilities. But in accounting, total liabilities include both current and non-current liabilities. Here, only current liabilities are provided, so we'll proceed with that.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,193,771.08\n- Total Revenue = 5,695,115.02\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (1,193,771.08 / 5,695,115.02) * 100 ≈ 20.96%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 3,730,866.78\n- Bank Deposits = 3,938,781.80\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 3,730,866.78 + 3,938,781.80 = 7,669,648.58\n- Current Liabilities = 829,755.77\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 7,669,648.58 / 829,755.77 ≈ 9.24\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n**Definition:** Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -224,133.22\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures) = 106,218.20\n\nCalculation:\nFCF = -224,133.22 - 106,218.20 = -330,351.42\n\nThis matches the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents at the bottom of the cash flow statement, which is -330,351.42.\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Profit = 1,193,771.08\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 15,023,526.85\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (1,193,771.08 / 15,023,526.85) * 100 ≈ 7.95%\n\n### Final Answer:\nNow, compiling all these calculations into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '12.01', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.83%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '20.96%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '9.24', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-330351.42', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '7.95%'} }\n```\n\n**Note on Debt to Asset Ratio:** Since only current liabilities are provided (829,755.77), and total assets are 15,023,526.85, the ratio is approximately 0.055, which I've rounded to 0.06 for consistency with the example's format. If there were non-current liabilities, the ratio would be higher, but they're not provided here.",
