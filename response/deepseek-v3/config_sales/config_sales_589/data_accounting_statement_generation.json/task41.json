                        "content": "To calculate the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" for the cash flow statement, we need to identify all purchase transactions where the payment method is \"Account Payable\" and the payment status is \"Unpaid\". These represent the amounts that have been recorded as accounts payable but have not yet been paid out in cash.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Purchases with Payment Method \"Account Payable\":**\n   - We need to filter all purchase transactions where:\n     - `type` is \"Purchase\"\n     - `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\"\n     - `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\"\n\n2. **List of Relevant Transactions:**\n   - From the given data, the following transactions meet the criteria:\n     - `Purchase20231231002`: Amount = 90,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231003`: Amount = 30,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231018`: Amount = 60,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231024`: Amount = 200,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231026`: Amount = 25,000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231027`: Amount = 140,000.0\n\n3. **Sum the Amounts:**\n   - Total Accounts Payable = 90,000 + 30,000 + 60,000 + 200,000 + 25,000 + 140,000 = 545,000.0\n\n4. **Interpretation for Cash Flow Statement:**\n   - The \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" in the cash flow statement represents the net change in accounts payable during the period. Since all these amounts are unpaid (i.e., they represent an increase in accounts payable), the total increase is 545,000.0.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '545000.00'}}\n```",
