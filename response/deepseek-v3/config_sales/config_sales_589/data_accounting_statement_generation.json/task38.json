                        "content": "To calculate the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" for the cash flow statement, we need to analyze the sales transactions where the payment/receipt_status is \"Unpaid\" and the receive_method is \"Account Receviable\". These transactions represent sales that have not yet been collected in cash, thus increasing accounts receivable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Sales Transactions:**\n   - We need to look for all sales transactions where `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" and `receive_method` is \"Account Receviable\".\n\n2. **Sum the Amounts of These Transactions:**\n   - For each identified transaction, we will sum the `amount` field to get the total increase in accounts receivable.\n\n3. **List of Unpaid Sales Transactions:**\n   - Sale20240102004: 37,626.38\n   - Sale20240103007: 38,445.68\n   - Sale20240105015: 35,631.18\n   - Sale20240108026: 37,876.84\n   - Sale20240109030: 18,677.88\n   - Sale20240110036: 56,061.81\n   - Sale20240111040: 105,728.19\n   - Sale20240112046: 104,829.42\n   - Sale20240115058: 38,068.12\n   - Sale20240117065: 37,557.79\n   - Sale20240117067: 26,920.14\n   - Sale20240118070: 71,318.72\n   - Sale20240119074: 38,340.34\n   - Sale20240120078: 58,291.95\n   - Sale20240121081: 55,928.04\n   - Sale20240121082: 195,264.22\n   - Sale20240124090: 261,905.28\n   - Sale20240126097: 39,113.14\n   - Sale20240127102: 36,474.74\n   - Sale20240128109: 268,538.40\n\n4. **Summing the Amounts:**\n   - Let's add all these amounts together:\n     - 37,626.38 + 38,445.68 = 76,072.06\n     - 76,072.06 + 35,631.18 = 111,703.24\n     - 111,703.24 + 37,876.84 = 149,580.08\n     - 149,580.08 + 18,677.88 = 168,257.96\n     - 168,257.96 + 56,061.81 = 224,319.77\n     - 224,319.77 + 105,728.19 = 330,047.96\n     - 330,047.96 + 104,829.42 = 434,877.38\n     - 434,877.38 + 38,068.12 = 472,945.50\n     - 472,945.50 + 37,557.79 = 510,503.29\n     - 510,503.29 + 26,920.14 = 537,423.43\n     - 537,423.43 + 71,318.72 = 608,742.15\n     - 608,742.15 + 38,340.34 = 647,082.49\n     - 647,082.49 + 58,291.95 = 705,374.44\n     - 705,374.44 + 55,928.04 = 761,302.48\n     - 761,302.48 + 195,264.22 = 956,566.70\n     - 956,566.70 + 261,905.28 = 1,218,471.98\n     - 1,218,471.98 + 39,113.14 = 1,257,585.12\n     - 1,257,585.12 + 36,474.74 = 1,294,059.86\n     - 1,294,059.86 + 268,538.40 = 1,562,598.26\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The total increase in accounts receivable is 1,562,598.26.\n   - In the cash flow statement, an increase in accounts receivable is shown as a negative value because it represents cash not received. Therefore, the value is -1,562,598.26.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\": \"-1562598.26\"}}\n```",
