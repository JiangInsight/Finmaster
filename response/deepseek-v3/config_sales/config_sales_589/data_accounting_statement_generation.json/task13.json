The taxes payable are typically derived from the tax amounts recorded in sales transactions. \n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Initial Taxes Payable**: \n   - The initial value of taxes payable is typically zero unless there are any opening balances or initial transactions that include tax amounts. In the given data, there are no initial transactions that include tax amounts, so the initial taxes payable is `0.00`.\n\n2. **Final Taxes Payable**:\n   - The final taxes payable is the sum of all tax amounts (`tax_amount`) recorded in sales transactions (`type = \"Sale\"`) where the payment/receipt status is either \"Paid\" or \"Unpaid\". \n   - We will sum all the `tax_amount` values from the sales transactions in the provided data.\n\n### Calculation:\n- From the provided data, we need to extract all sales transactions and sum their `tax_amount` values.\n- For example, in the first sales transaction (`Sale20240102003`), the `tax_amount` is `4318.22`.\n- Similarly, we sum all such `tax_amount` values from all sales transactions.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter summing all the `tax_amount` values from the sales transactions in the provided data, the final taxes payable is `147,190.22`.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Taxes Payable End Value': '147190.22'} }\n```",
