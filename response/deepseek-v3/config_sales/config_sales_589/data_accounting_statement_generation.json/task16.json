                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the paid-in capital for the balance sheet, which includes both the initial and final amounts. Paid-in capital typically represents the amount of money that shareholders have invested in the company through the purchase of stock. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Transactions**:\n   - Look for transactions that represent initial capital injections. These are usually labeled as \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", or similar in the \"type\" column.\n   - In the provided data, the initial transactions are:\n     - \"Cash deposit\" with amount 3,000,000.0\n     - \"Bank deposit\" with amount 5,000,000.0\n     - \"Fixed Assets\" with amount 5,000,000.0\n\n2. **Calculate Initial Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Sum the amounts of the initial transactions:\n     - 3,000,000.0 (Cash deposit) \n     + 5,000,000.0 (Bank deposit) \n     + 5,000,000.0 (Fixed Assets) \n     = 13,000,000.0\n\n3. **Determine Final Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Paid-in capital does not typically change unless there are additional capital injections or withdrawals. In the provided data, there are no transactions indicating additional capital injections or withdrawals after the initial transactions. Therefore, the final paid-in capital remains the same as the initial amount.\n\n4. **Result**:\n   - Initial Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.0\n   - Final Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.0\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
