Depreciation is typically recorded as an expense that reduces the value of fixed assets over time. \n\nLooking at the transactions data, we can see that there is a specific entry labeled \"Depreciation\" with the ID \"Depreciation20240101001\". The amount recorded for this entry is \"45749.3\". \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Depreciation Entry**: Scan through the transactions to find any entry with the type \"Depreciation\".\n2. **Extract the Amount**: Once the depreciation entry is found, note the amount associated with it.\n3. **Verify the Entry**: Ensure that the entry is correctly labeled and has not been duplicated or misrecorded.\n\nFrom the data, the depreciation entry is:\n```\nDepreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45749.3 | 45749.3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n```\n\nThe amount is clearly \"45749.3\".\n\nThus, the final depreciation item in the cash flow statement is \"45749.3\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45749.3'} }\n```",
