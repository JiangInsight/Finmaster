These transactions represent the purchase of fixed assets.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Transaction**:\n   - In the provided data, there is one transaction with `type` = \"Fixed Assets Purchase\":\n     - `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 106218.2 | 106218.2 | ... | Production Line4 | Production Line`\n\n3. **Extract the Amount**:\n   - The `amount` for this transaction is `106218.2`. This is the value of the fixed asset purchased.\n\n4. **Verify Payment Status**:\n   - The `payment/receipt_status` for this transaction is \"Paid\", which means the amount has been paid and should be included in the cash flow statement.\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Purchase of Fixed Assets**:\n   - Since this is the only fixed asset purchase transaction in the data, the total purchase of fixed assets is `106218.2`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '106218.2'}}\n```",
