The accumulated depreciation is typically recorded through depreciation expense entries over time. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Value of Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The initial value of accumulated depreciation at the start of the period (2023-12-31) is typically zero unless there are prior depreciation entries. In the given data, there are no initial depreciation entries before the first depreciation expense, so the initial value is `0.00`.\n\n2. **Identify Depreciation Expense Entries**:\n   - We need to look for transactions where the `type` is \"Depreciation\". These entries represent the depreciation expense for the period, which adds to the accumulated depreciation.\n   - In the provided data, there is one depreciation entry:\n     - `Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45749.3 | 45749.3 | ...`\n\n3. **Calculate Accumulated Depreciation End Value**:\n   - The end value of accumulated depreciation is the sum of all depreciation expenses recorded during the period. Since there is only one depreciation entry, the end value is `45749.30`.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00`, and the end value is `45749.30`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accumulated Depreciation End Value\": \"45749.30\"}}\n```",
