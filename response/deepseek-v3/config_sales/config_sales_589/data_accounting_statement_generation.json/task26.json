Depreciation is typically recorded as an expense in the income statement, and we can find it by looking for transactions where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Depreciation Transactions**: \n   - Look through the transactions data for entries where the \"type\" column is \"Depreciation\".\n   - In the provided data, there is one such transaction with the ID \"Depreciation20240101001\".\n\n2. **Extract the Depreciation Amount**:\n   - The amount for this transaction is listed as \"45749.3\" in the \"amount\" column.\n\n3. **Verify the Transaction**:\n   - The transaction is recorded on \"2024-01-01\" and has no other conflicting entries or adjustments.\n   - The \"recorded_amount\" is the same as the \"amount\", confirming the depreciation expense is correctly recorded.\n\n4. **Format the Answer**:\n   - The depreciation amount should be presented as a string in the solution JSON.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45749.3'} }\n```",
