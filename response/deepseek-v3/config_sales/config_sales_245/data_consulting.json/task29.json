                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step to make sure I understand how to calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures the proportion of a company's financing that comes from debt compared to equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 1,124,588.25\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: 14,163,543.07\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,124,588.25}{14,163,543.07} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{1,124,588.25}{14,163,543.07} \\approx 0.0794 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.08\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition**: This shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit**: 1,163,543.07\n- **Total Revenue**: 5,991,764.34\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,163,543.07}{5,991,764.34} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nMath:\n\\[ \\frac{1,163,543.07}{5,991,764.34} \\approx 0.1943 \\]\n\\[ 0.1943 \\times 100\\% \\approx 19.43\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n\n**Definition**: This measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nSince we have beginning and ending total assets, we can calculate average total assets as:\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Total Assets} + \\text{Ending Total Assets}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Initial Total Assets (Beginning)**: 13,000,000.00\n- **End Total Assets**: 15,288,131.32\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{13,000,000.00 + 15,288,131.32}{2} = \\frac{28,288,131.32}{2} = 14,144,065.66 \\]\n\nNow, ROA:\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{1,163,543.07}{14,144,065.66} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nMath:\n\\[ \\frac{1,163,543.07}{14,144,065.66} \\approx 0.0823 \\]\n\\[ 0.0823 \\times 100\\% \\approx 8.23\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This measures how efficiently a company collects receivables from customers. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since cash sales aren't specified), we can use Total Revenue for Net Credit Sales.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Total Revenue**: 5,991,764.34\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Initial Accounts Receivable**: 0.00\n- **End Accounts Receivable**: 1,133,414.13\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable:\n\\[ \\frac{0.00 + 1,133,414.13}{2} = \\frac{1,133,414.13}{2} = 566,707.065 \\]\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,991,764.34}{566,707.065} \\]\n\nMath:\n\\[ \\frac{5,991,764.34}{566,707.065} \\approx 10.57 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.43%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '8.23%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '10.57'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly check if these numbers make sense based on the example provided.\n\n- In the example:\n  - Debt to Equity: 0.16 (higher than ours, which makes sense since their liabilities were higher relative to equity)\n  - Net Profit Margin: -30.29% (ours is positive, which aligns with positive net profit)\n  - ROA: -12.55% (ours is positive, matching the positive net profit)\n  - AR Turnover: 4.47 (ours is higher, indicating more efficient collection, which seems plausible given the numbers)\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.43%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '8.23%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '10.57'}}\n```",
