                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. I'll go through each one, explaining how to compute them based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n**Definition:** ROE measures a company's profitability by showing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,163,543.07\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount column):\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,163,543.07\n\nWait a minute, the balance sheet shows:\n- Paid-in Capital = 13,000,000.00\n- Retained Earnings = 1,163,543.07\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,163,543.07\n\nBut actually, the Net Profit from the income statement is the same as the increase in Retained Earnings (since it's the first period, initial retained earnings are 0). So, Total Owner's Equity is indeed 14,163,543.07.\n\nCalculating ROE:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{1,163,543.07}{14,163,543.07} \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n1,163,543.07 / 14,163,543.07 ≈ 0.0821\n\n0.0821 * 100 ≈ 8.21%\n\nSo, ROE ≈ 8.21%\n\n### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount column):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n- Total Assets = 15,288,131.32\n\nCalculating Debt to Asset Ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,124,588.25}{15,288,131.32} \\]\n\n1,124,588.25 / 15,288,131.32 ≈ 0.0736\n\nSo, Debt to Asset Ratio ≈ 0.07 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n### 3. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 2,741,764.34\n- Total Revenue = 5,991,764.34\n\nCalculating Gross Profit Margin:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{2,741,764.34}{5,991,764.34} \\times 100 \\]\n\n2,741,764.34 / 5,991,764.34 ≈ 0.4576\n\n0.4576 * 100 ≈ 45.76%\n\nSo, Gross Profit Margin ≈ 45.76%\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **ROE:**\n   - Net Profit: 1,163,543.07\n   - Equity: 14,163,543.07\n   - 1,163,543.07 / 14,163,543.07 ≈ 0.0821 → 8.21% ✔\n\n2. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 1,124,588.25\n   - Assets: 15,288,131.32\n   - 1,124,588.25 / 15,288,131.32 ≈ 0.0736 → 0.07 ✔\n\n3. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: 2,741,764.34\n   - Revenue: 5,991,764.34\n   - 2,741,764.34 / 5,991,764.34 ≈ 0.4576 → 45.76% ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.21%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.07', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.76%'} }\n```",
