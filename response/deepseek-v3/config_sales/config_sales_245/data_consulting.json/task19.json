                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate both the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its current assets. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Since we only have the ending inventory (no beginning inventory other than zero), we'll use the ending inventory as the average inventory for this calculation.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (end amounts as of 2024-01-29):\n\n- **Total Current Assets**: 10,333,889.03\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 1,124,588.25\n- **Inventory**: 975,000.00\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 3,250,000.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{10,333,889.03}{1,124,588.25}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10,333,889.03}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 9.19\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **9.19**.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nSince the beginning inventory is 0 (from the initial amount on 2023-12-31) and the ending inventory is 975,000.00, the average inventory is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{0 + 975,000.00}{2} = 487,500.00\n\\]\n\nBut since the beginning inventory is zero, and the company didn't have any inventory at the start, using the ending inventory might be more appropriate here to avoid division by zero or an infinite ratio. Alternatively, if we consider that the inventory was zero at the start and ended at 975,000, the average inventory is 487,500.\n\nHowever, in the example provided, the Inventory Turnover was calculated using the ending inventory (since beginning was zero), leading to:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Ending Inventory}} = \\frac{3,250,000.00}{975,000.00} \\approx 3.33\n\\]\n\nBut let's see the example's calculation for consistency:\n\nIn the example:\n- COGS: 4,410,000\n- Inventory: 5,090,000\n- Inventory Turnover: 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.87, but the given solution is 1.73, which suggests they might have used average inventory where beginning was zero and ending was 5,090,000, so average is 2,545,000, then 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73.\n\nSo, applying the same method here:\n\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (0 + 975,000) / 2 = 487,500\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,250,000}{487,500} \\approx 6.67\n\\]\n\nBut this seems high compared to the example. Maybe the example used ending inventory directly despite beginning being zero, leading to a lower ratio.\n\nAlternatively, if we use ending inventory directly:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3,250,000}{975,000} \\approx 3.33\n\\]\n\nGiven the example's approach seems to use average inventory even when beginning is zero, leading to 1.73, I'll stick with that method for consistency.\n\nSo, average inventory is 487,500.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,250,000}{487,500} \\approx 6.67\n\\]\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the example where COGS was higher relative to inventory but ratio was lower. Maybe the example had a typo in the ratio.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the standard is to use ending inventory when beginning is zero to avoid infinite ratios.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the example used average (beginning zero), I'll proceed with average inventory.\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,250,000}{487,500} \\approx 6.67\n\\]\n\nBut looking back, in the example:\n\nBeginning inventory: 0\nEnding inventory: 5,090,000\nAverage: 2,545,000\nCOGS: 4,410,000\nRatio: 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nSimilarly here:\n\nBeginning: 0\nEnding: 975,000\nAverage: 487,500\nCOGS: 3,250,000\nRatio: 3,250,000 / 487,500 ≈ 6.67\n\nThis seems correct based on the method.\n\n### Final Calculations\n\n- **Current Ratio**: 9.19\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: 6.67\n\nHowever, the example's inventory turnover seems low compared to COGS/inventory, suggesting maybe COGS was for a longer period or inventory was higher at other times. Given that, and since in the problem both beginning and ending are given (but beginning is zero), it's likely that the average is (beginning + ending)/2.\n\nThus, sticking with:\n\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 975,000) / 2 = 487,500\nInventory Turnover = 3,250,000 / 487,500 ≈ 6.67\n\nBut the example's ratio seems to use ending inventory directly (4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.87, but given as 1.73), which doesn't match. Maybe the example's ratio is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct method is average inventory, leading to 6.67 here.\n\nBut to match the example's approach (assuming they used ending inventory despite beginning zero), then:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Ending Inventory = 3,250,000 / 975,000 ≈ 3.33\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the example seems to use average (beginning zero), leading to higher ratio, I'll go with average inventory.\n\nThus, final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '9.19', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '6.67'}}\n```\n\nHowever, considering that in the example, with beginning inventory zero, they likely used ending inventory to avoid division by zero in average, leading to:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Ending Inventory\n\nSo for the problem:\n\nInventory Turnover = 3,250,000 / 975,000 ≈ 3.33\n\nGiven that, and to align with the example's approach (even if their calculation seems off), I'll adjust to:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '9.19', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.33'}}\n```\n\nBut the example's given ratio is 1.73 with COGS 4,410,000 and inventory 5,090,000, which would be 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.87, not matching 1.73. Maybe they used average inventory where beginning was not zero but not provided. Given that, it's unclear.\n\nGiven the data here, and beginning inventory is zero, the most reasonable is to use ending inventory, leading to 3.33.\n\nThus, final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '9.19', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.33'}}\n```\n\nBut looking back at the example's balance sheet, initial inventory was 0, end was 5,090,000, so average is 2,545,000, COGS 4,410,000, so 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73, which matches their given ratio.\n\nSo applying same method here:\n\nBeginning inventory: 0\nEnding inventory: 975,000\nAverage: 487,500\nCOGS: 3,250,000\nInventory Turnover: 3,250,000 / 487,500 ≈ 6.67\n\nThus, the correct ratio is 6.67, matching the method in the example.\n\nTherefore, the example's ratio was calculated with average inventory (beginning zero), so same here.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '9.19', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '6.67'}}\n```",
