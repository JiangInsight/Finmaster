                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all Main Business Revenue is credit sales) = 5,991,764.34\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial_amount) = 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 1,133,414.13\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 1,133,414.13) / 2 = 566,707.065\n\n**Calculation:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,991,764.34 / 566,707.065 ≈ 10.57\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 1,124,588.25\n\n**Calculation:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = 215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.19\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems similar to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. Typically, both terms refer to the same calculation where operating cash flow is divided by current liabilities. \n\nGiven that, it would be the same as above:\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio ≈ 0.19\n\nHowever, in the example provided, both 'operating cash flow ratio' and 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio' had the same value (-3.90), suggesting they might be treated the same here. \n\nSo, unless there's a different interpretation, both would be 0.19.\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Sales (Total Revenue) = 5,991,764.34\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Total Assets (Initial_amount) = 13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets (End_amount) = 15,288,131.32\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 15,288,131.32) / 2 = 14,144,065.66\n\n**Calculation:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = 5,991,764.34 / 14,144,065.66 ≈ 0.42\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 1,124,588.25\n- Total Shareholders' Equity (End_amount) = 14,163,543.07\n\n**Calculation:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,124,588.25 / 14,163,543.07 ≈ 0.079 or 0.08\n\nHowever, in the example, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity, which seems correct. Maybe there's a consideration of all liabilities, but here only current liabilities are present.\n\nGiven that, it's 0.08.\n\nBut looking back at the example, their Debt to Equity was 0.16, and their Total Current Liabilities were 1,861,550.92, and Total Owner's Equity was 11,354,858.57, which is 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16. \n\nSimilarly here, 1,124,588.25 / 14,163,543.07 ≈ 0.079, which rounds to 0.08.\n\nPerhaps the example had more liabilities not listed, but here it's just current liabilities.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '10.57', 'operating cash flow ratio': '0.19', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.19', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.42', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me double-check the calculations quickly:\n\n1. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:**\n   - 5,991,764.34 / ((0 + 1,133,414.13)/2) = 5,991,764.34 / 566,707.065 ≈ 10.57 ✔\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n   - 215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.19 ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:**\n   - Same as above: 0.19 ✔\n\n4. **Total Asset Turnover Ratio:**\n   - 5,991,764.34 / ((13,000,000 + 15,288,131.32)/2) = 5,991,764.34 / 14,144,065.66 ≈ 0.42 ✔\n\n5. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 1,124,588.25 / 14,163,543.07 ≈ 0.08 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
