                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 1,124,588.25\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities:** Not provided explicitly, but looking at the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities.\" There's no separate line for long-term debt or non-current liabilities. So, we'll assume that total liabilities are equal to total current liabilities, which is 1,124,588.25.\n  \n  *Wait a minute, looking back at the balance sheet, under \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity,\" it sums up to 15,288,131.32, which is equal to Total Assets. The components are Total Current Liabilities (1,124,588.25) and Total Owner's Equity (14,163,543.07). So, indeed, there are no non-current liabilities listed. Therefore, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25.*\n\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 15,288,131.32\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,124,588.25}{15,288,131.32} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n1,124,588.25 ÷ 15,288,131.32 ≈ 0.0736\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.0736 or 7.36%. \n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.14', which is a decimal, not a percentage. So, we'll present it as a decimal: 0.0736, which we can round to 0.07.\n\n*Wait, maybe I missed something. Is there any other debt? The balance sheet seems to only list current liabilities. Maybe the \"Paid-in Capital\" is considered debt? No, that's part of equity. So, unless there's hidden debt, it's just the current liabilities.*\n\nGiven that, I think the correct calculation is 0.07.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 2,741,764.34\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,991,764.34\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,741,764.34}{5,991,764.34} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nDoing the division first:\n\n2,741,764.34 ÷ 5,991,764.34 ≈ 0.4576\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n\n0.4576 × 100 ≈ 45.76%\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 45.76%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** 215,423.24\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 1,124,588.25\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{215,423.24}{1,124,588.25} \\]\n\nDoing the division:\n\n215,423.24 ÷ 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.1916\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.19.\n\nBut in the example, it was given as '-3.90', which seems to be a much larger magnitude. Maybe it's presented differently. Here, our operating cash flow is positive, so it's 0.19.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating all three ratios:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.07\n- Gross Profit Margin: 45.76%\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: 0.19\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the ratios were presented as:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: '0.14' (ours is lower)\n- Gross Profit Margin: '18.80%' (ours is higher)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: '-3.90' (ours is positive and much smaller)\n\nThis makes me think that perhaps the Operating Cash Flow Ratio in the example was calculated differently, maybe using average current liabilities or some other adjustment. But based on standard definitions, our calculations seem correct.\n\nGiven that, here's the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.07', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.76%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.19'}}\n```\n\n*Wait a second, let me double-check the Operating Cash Flow Ratio calculation.*\n\nIs \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" correctly identified? In the cash flow statement, it's listed as 215,423.24, and current liabilities are 1,124,588.25, so the ratio is indeed ~0.19. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is sometimes calculated using Operating Cash Flow before changes in working capital, but that's not standard. \n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is as above.\n\n### Rechecking Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nIs there any other liability not considered? The balance sheet shows:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,124,588.25\n- Total Owner's Equity: 14,163,543.07\n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity: 15,288,131.32 (matches Total Assets)\n\nSo, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25.\n\nThus, Debt to Asset Ratio = 1,124,588.25 / 15,288,131.32 ≈ 0.0736 → '0.07'\n\n### Rechecking Gross Profit Margin\n\nGross Profit = 2,741,764.34\n\nTotal Revenue = 5,991,764.34\n\nRatio = 2,741,764.34 / 5,991,764.34 ≈ 0.4576 → '45.76%'\n\n### Rechecking Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24\n\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\nRatio = 215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.1916 → '0.19'\n\nEverything checks out. \n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.07', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.76%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.19'}}\n```",
