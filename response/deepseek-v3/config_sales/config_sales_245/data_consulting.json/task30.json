                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 10,333,889.03\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 1,124,588.25\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 10,333,889.03 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 9.19\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 4,560,423.24\n- Bank Deposits = 3,655,000.00\n- Interest Receivable = 10,051.66\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,133,414.13\n- Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 4,560,423.24 + 3,655,000.00 + 10,051.66 + 1,133,414.13 = 9,358,889.03\n\nQuick Ratio = 9,358,889.03 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 8.32\n\n*Note:* Sometimes interest receivable might not be included in quick assets, but since it's a short-term receivable, I included it here. If excluded, Quick Assets would be 9,348,837.37, and Quick Ratio ≈ 8.31.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 1,124,588.25\n- Total Assets = 15,288,131.32\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,124,588.25 / 15,288,131.32 ≈ 0.074 or 0.07\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,163,543.07\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,124,588.25 / 14,163,543.07 ≈ 0.079 or 0.08\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = 215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.19\n\n*Note:* Sometimes this ratio uses average debt, but since we only have end-of-period debt, we'll use that.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '9.19', 'Quick Ratio': '8.32', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.07', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.19'} }\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Current Ratio:** 10,333,889.03 / 1,124,588.25 = 9.19 ✔\n2. **Quick Ratio:** (4,560,423.24 + 3,655,000.00 + 10,051.66 + 1,133,414.13) / 1,124,588.25 = 9,358,889.03 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 8.32 ✔\n3. **Debt to Asset:** 1,124,588.25 / 15,288,131.32 ≈ 0.07 ✔\n4. **Debt to Equity:** 1,124,588.25 / 14,163,543.07 ≈ 0.08 ✔\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt:** 215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.19 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
