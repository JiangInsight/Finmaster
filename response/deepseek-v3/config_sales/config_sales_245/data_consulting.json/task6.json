I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I recall that the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. The formula for Net Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us the margin as a percentage.\n\n### Identifying the Necessary Values\nFrom the given income statement, I need two key pieces of information:\n1. **Net Profit**: This is the final profit after all expenses and taxes.\n2. **Total Revenue**: This is the total income generated by the business before any expenses are deducted.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- **Net Profit**: 1,163,543.07 (this is positive, which is good!)\n- **Total Revenue**: 5,991,764.34\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,163,543.07}{5,991,764.34} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,163,543.07}{5,991,764.34} \\approx 0.1942 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.1942 \\times 100 \\approx 19.42\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nLet me double-check the division to ensure accuracy:\n\n- 1,163,543.07 ÷ 5,991,764.34 ≈ 0.1942\n- 0.1942 × 100 = 19.42%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n### Considering the Example\nLooking back at the provided example:\n- Net Profit was negative, and the margin was -30.29%.\n- Here, our Net Profit is positive, so the margin should be positive as well.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter performing the calculation, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 19.42%. \n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '19.42%'} }\n```",
