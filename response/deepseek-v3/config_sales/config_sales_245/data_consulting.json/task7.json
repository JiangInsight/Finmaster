In this case, the purchase of fixed assets is 0.00, so the FCF is essentially the net cash flow from operating activities.\n   - FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n   - FCF = 215423.24 + (-0.00) = 215423.24\n\n4. **Verify with Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The net increase in cash and cash equivalents is 215423.24, which matches our FCF calculation. This confirms our calculation is correct.\n\nThus, the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is 215423.24.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '215423.24'} }\n```",
