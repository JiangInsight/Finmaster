                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested metrics based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFree Cash Flow is typically calculated as:\n**FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures (CapEx)**\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (which is CapEx) = 0.00\n\nSo,\n**FCF = 215,423.24 - 0 = 215,423.24**\n\n### 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It's calculated as:\n**ROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets**\n\nFirst, we need Average Total Assets:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 15,288,131.32\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial + End) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 15,288,131.32) / 2 = 14,144,065.66\n\nNet Profit = 1,163,543.07\n\nSo,\n**ROA = 1,163,543.07 / 14,144,065.66 ≈ 0.0823 or 8.23%**\n\n### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE measures a company's profitability relative to shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n**ROE = Net Profit / Average Shareholders' Equity**\n\nAverage Shareholders' Equity:\n- Initial Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Equity = 14,163,543.07\n- Average = (13,000,000 + 14,163,543.07) / 2 = 13,581,771.54\n\nNet Profit = 1,163,543.07\n\nSo,\n**ROE = 1,163,543.07 / 13,581,771.54 ≈ 0.0857 or 8.57%**\n\n### 4. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operations to the net income. It's calculated as:\n**Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Income**\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24\n- Net Income = 1,163,543.07\n\nSo,\n**Ratio = 215,423.24 / 1,163,543.07 ≈ 0.185**\n\n### 5. Net Profit Margin\nNet Profit Margin shows how much of each dollar in revenue translates to profit. It's calculated as:\n**Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue**\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,163,543.07\n- Total Revenue = 5,991,764.34\n\nSo,\n**Net Profit Margin = 1,163,543.07 / 5,991,764.34 ≈ 0.194 or 19.4%**\n\n### 6. Gross Profit Margin\nGross Profit Margin measures the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold. It's calculated as:\n**Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue**\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 2,741,764.34\n- Total Revenue = 5,991,764.34\n\nSo,\n**Gross Profit Margin = 2,741,764.34 / 5,991,764.34 ≈ 0.4576 or 45.76%**\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling all these calculations into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '215423.24', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '8.23%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.57%', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.19', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.42%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.76%'} }\n```\n\n**Note on Rounding:**\nSome percentages were rounded to two decimal places for clarity, but the exact calculations were used to derive the final numbers. For instance, 0.0823 for ROA is 8.23%, and similarly for others. The Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio was kept at two decimal places for simplicity. \n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify one of the calculations to ensure accuracy. For ROA:\n- Net Profit = 1,163,543.07\n- Average Assets = (13,000,000 + 15,288,131.32)/2 = 14,144,065.66\n- 1,163,543.07 / 14,144,065.66 ≈ 0.0823 → 8.23% ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
