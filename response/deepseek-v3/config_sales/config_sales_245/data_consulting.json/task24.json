                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 1,124,588.25\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n- Total Assets (End_amount): 15,288,131.32\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,124,588.25}{15,288,131.32} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{1,124,588.25}{15,288,131.32} \\approx 0.07356 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.07\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.14', which suggests it might be presented as a decimal to two places or perhaps as a percentage. Since the example shows '0.14' (which is 14%), I'll present it similarly.\n\nSo, 0.07356 is approximately 0.07 or 7%.\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have rounded differently or perhaps included more liabilities. Here, since only current liabilities are present, it's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is presented as a decimal to two decimal places without multiplying by 100. So, 0.07.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet shows:\n- Accounts Payable: 825,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 299,588.25\nTotal Current Liabilities: 825,000 + 299,588.25 = 1,124,588.25\nNo other liabilities are listed, so that's correct.\n\nSo, Debt to Asset Ratio = 0.07\n\nBut in the example, it was '0.14', which is higher. Maybe they included something else, but here it's straightforward.\n\nI think it's correct as 0.07.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operations to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 215,423.24\n- Net Profit (from Income Statement): 1,163,543.07\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{215,423.24}{1,163,543.07} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{215,423.24}{1,163,543.07} \\approx 0.185 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.19\n\nBut in the example, the ratio was '4.41', which is much higher, indicating that the operating cash flow was higher than net income. Here, the operating cash flow is less than net income, so the ratio is less than 1.\n\nThis seems correct based on the numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check the cash flow from operating activities:\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities is indeed 215,423.24.\n\nNet Profit is 1,163,543.07.\n\nSo, 215,423.24 / 1,163,543.07 ≈ 0.185 → 0.19\n\nBut in the example, the net cash flow was negative and net income was negative, leading to a positive ratio higher than 1. Here, both are positive, and operating cash flow is less than net income, so ratio is less than 1.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.07', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.19'} }\n```\n\nHowever, let me cross-validate the Debt to Asset Ratio calculation once more to ensure no other liabilities are missed.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity: 15,288,131.32\n- Total Owner's Equity: 14,163,543.07\nSo, Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Total Owner's Equity\n= 15,288,131.32 - 14,163,543.07 = 1,124,588.25\n\nWhich matches the sum of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable. So, no other liabilities.\n\nThus, Debt to Asset Ratio is indeed 1,124,588.25 / 15,288,131.32 ≈ 0.07.\n\nSimilarly, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is correctly calculated as 0.19.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.07', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '0.19'} }\n```",
