                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of the required ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each calculation step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{215,423.24}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 0.19 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are:\n- Accounts Payable = 825,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 299,588.25\nTotal Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25 (which seems to be the total debt as there are no non-current liabilities listed).\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{215,423.24}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 0.19 \\]\n\n*Note: If there were long-term debts, we'd include those in total debt, but here it seems only current liabilities exist.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 3,250,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- End Inventory = 975,000.00\nAverage Inventory = (Initial + End) / 2 = (0 + 975,000) / 2 = 487,500.00\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,250,000.00}{487,500.00} \\approx 6.67 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute, the initial inventory is 0, which might not make sense for averaging. Maybe we should use ending inventory if beginning is zero. Alternatively, if inventory was zero at start and 975,000 at end, perhaps the average is closer to end inventory if most purchases were recent. But standard practice is to average, so unless specified, we'll proceed with average.*\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholder equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,163,543.07\n(No non-current liabilities are listed, so total liabilities = current liabilities)\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,124,588.25}{14,163,543.07} \\approx 0.08 \\]\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 10,333,889.03\n- Inventory = 975,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{10,333,889.03 - 975,000.00}{1,124,588.25} = \\frac{9,358,889.03}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 8.32 \\]\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 10,333,889.03\n- Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{10,333,889.03}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 9.19 \\]\n\n### Reviewing Calculations:\nLet me double-check the Inventory Turnover Ratio because the initial inventory was zero, which might skew the average. If we use ending inventory instead of average (which is sometimes done if beginning inventory is zero or not representative):\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,250,000.00}{975,000.00} \\approx 3.33 \\]\n\nThis seems more reasonable than 6.67. So, I'll adjust to using ending inventory here.\n\nSimilarly, for Operating Cash Flow and Cash Flow to Debt, both came out to 0.19, which seems correct based on the data.\n\nDebt to Equity is very low at 0.08, which indicates minimal debt relative to equity.\n\nQuick and Current Ratios are very high (>8 and >9), which might indicate a lot of liquid assets relative to liabilities, possibly more than necessary, but based on the numbers, that's correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.19', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.19', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.33', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08', 'Quick Ratio': '8.32', 'Current Ratio': '9.19'} }\n```",
