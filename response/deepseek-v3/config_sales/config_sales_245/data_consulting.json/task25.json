                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThe Debt to Equity Ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**  \n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 1,124,588.25  \n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,163,543.07  \n\n*Note:* Sometimes, \"Total Liabilities\" might include both current and non-current liabilities, but in this balance sheet, only current liabilities are provided. Assuming that's all the debt the company has.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,124,588.25}{14,163,543.07} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,124,588.25}{14,163,543.07} \\approx 0.0794 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.08\n\n*But looking at the example provided, the ratio was given to two decimal places, so I'll follow that.*\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**  \nThe Net Profit Margin shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n**From the Income Statement:**  \n- Net Profit = 1,163,543.07  \n- Total Revenue = 5,991,764.34  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,163,543.07}{5,991,764.34} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nCalculating the division first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,163,543.07}{5,991,764.34} \\approx 0.1942 \\]\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n\n\\[ 0.1942 \\times 100\\% \\approx 19.42\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThis ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**  \n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24  \n- From the Balance Sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{215,423.24}{1,124,588.25} \\]\n\nCalculating the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{215,423.24}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 0.1916 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.19\n\n*But in the example, this ratio was given to two decimal places without a percentage sign, so I'll present it as 0.19.*\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.42%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.19'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**  \nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**  \n   1,124,588.25 / 14,163,543.07 ≈ 0.0794 → 0.08 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**  \n   1,163,543.07 / 5,991,764.34 ≈ 0.1942 → 19.42% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:**  \n   215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.1916 → 0.19 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! \n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Debt to Equity Ratio:** It's quite low (0.08), indicating the company is not heavily leveraged; it has much more equity than debt.\n- **Net Profit Margin:** At 19.42%, this is a healthy profit margin, meaning the company keeps about 19 cents in profit for every dollar of revenue.\n- **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:** 0.19 suggests that operating cash flow covers about 19% of current liabilities. Ideally, you'd want this to be higher (closer to or above 1) to comfortably cover short-term obligations, but it depends on the industry and other factors.\n\nThis seems to be a financially stable company with good profitability but could improve its ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flow.",
