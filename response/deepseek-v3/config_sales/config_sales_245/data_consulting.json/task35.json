                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how I arrive at the numbers. \n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 10,333,889.03\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 1,124,588.25\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 10,333,889.03 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 9.19\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Definition:** Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 2,741,764.34\n- Total Revenue = 5,991,764.34\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (2,741,764.34 / 5,991,764.34) * 100 ≈ 45.76%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are mentioned) = 1,124,588.25\n- Total Assets = 15,288,131.32\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,124,588.25 / 15,288,131.32 ≈ 0.074 or 7.4%\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have considered only current liabilities. If we consider all liabilities (which here is just current), it's 0.074. Maybe the example had some other liabilities, but here it's straightforward.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,163,543.07\n- Total Revenue = 5,991,764.34\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (1,163,543.07 / 5,991,764.34) * 100 ≈ 19.42%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** Cash to Current Debt Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 4,560,423.24\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 3,655,000.00\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 4,560,423.24 + 3,655,000.00 = 8,215,423.24\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 8,215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 7.31\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n**Definition:** Free Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures) = 0.00\n\nCalculation:\nFCF = 215,423.24 - 0 = 215,423.24\n\nBut looking at the example, they seem to have taken the \"Net Increase\" from the cash and cash equivalents section as FCF. Here, the Net Increase is 215,423.24. Maybe that's the approach.\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Profit = 1,163,543.07\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 15,288,131.32\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (1,163,543.07 / 15,288,131.32) * 100 ≈ 7.61%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '9.19', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.76%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.07', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.42%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '7.31', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '215423.24', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '7.61%'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure no mistakes.\n\n1. Current Ratio: 10,333,889.03 / 1,124,588.25 = 9.19 ✔\n2. Gross Profit Margin: 2,741,764.34 / 5,991,764.34 = 0.4576 → 45.76% ✔\n3. Debt to Asset: 1,124,588.25 / 15,288,131.32 ≈ 0.0735 → 0.07 ✔\n4. Net Profit Margin: 1,163,543.07 / 5,991,764.34 ≈ 0.1942 → 19.42% ✔\n5. Cash to Current Debt: (4,560,423.24 + 3,655,000) / 1,124,588.25 = 8,215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 7.31 ✔\n6. FCF: Net Increase is 215,423.24 ✔\n7. ROA: 1,163,543.07 / 15,288,131.32 ≈ 0.0761 → 7.61% ✔\n\nEverything checks out! \n\nFinal JSON:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '9.19', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.76%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.07', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.42%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '7.31', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '215423.24', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '7.61%'}}\n```",
