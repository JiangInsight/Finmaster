                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio indicates a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. A higher ratio means the company is more capable of paying off its debt with its cash flow.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   \n   Here, \"Total Debt\" is typically the sum of current and non-current liabilities. However, in the given balance sheet, we only have \"Total Current Liabilities\" and no non-current liabilities listed. So, we'll assume Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities.\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$5,991,764.34\n- Gross Profit: \\$2,741,764.34\n\nFrom the **cash flow statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: \\$215,423.24\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$1,124,588.25\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,741,764.34}{5,991,764.34} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2,741,764.34}{5,991,764.34} \\approx 0.4576\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.4576 \\times 100 \\approx 45.76\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **45.76%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{215,423.24}{1,124,588.25}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{215,423.24}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 0.1916\n\\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **0.19**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit / Total Revenue = 2,741,764.34 / 5,991,764.34 ≈ 0.4576 → 45.76%\n   - This seems correct.\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt = 215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.19\n   - Since there are no non-current liabilities, Total Debt is just Total Current Liabilities.\n   - This also seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating both ratios, here's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '45.76%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.19'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin**: A margin of 45.76% is quite healthy, indicating that the company retains a good portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: A ratio of 0.19 means that the company's operating cash flow is about 19% of its total debt. This suggests that it would take a little over five years of current cash flow to pay off the debt, assuming no changes in cash flow or debt. This is a bit low; generally, a higher ratio is preferable as it indicates better ability to cover debt obligations.\n\nIf there were non-current liabilities that weren't listed in the balance sheet, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio would be lower, indicating higher debt relative to cash flow. But based on the given data, we've calculated it correctly.",
