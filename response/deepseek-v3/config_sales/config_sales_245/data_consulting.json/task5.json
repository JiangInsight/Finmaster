                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Gross Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Gross Profit Margin is. From what I recall, the Gross Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods and services.\n\nThe formula for Gross Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Gross Profit** = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n- **Total Revenue** is the total income from sales before any expenses are deducted.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Main Business Revenue**: 5,991,764.34\n- **Total Revenue**: 5,991,764.34\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 3,250,000.00\n- **Gross Profit**: 2,741,764.34\n\nWait a minute, the Gross Profit is already given as 2,741,764.34. That's good because it saves me a step in calculating it (Total Revenue - COGS). \n\nBut just to double-check:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{COGS} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit} = 5,991,764.34 - 3,250,000.00 = 2,741,764.34 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the given Gross Profit. So, we can proceed with the given Gross Profit value.\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nNow, plug the values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{2,741,764.34}{5,991,764.34} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2,741,764.34}{5,991,764.34} \\approx 0.4576 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.4576 \\times 100 \\approx 45.76\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let's re-calculate:\n\n\\[ 2,741,764.34 \\div 5,991,764.34 \\approx 0.4576 \\]\n\\[ 0.4576 \\times 100 = 45.76\\% \\]\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\n### Considering Other Accounts\n\nLooking at the income statement, there are other accounts like Administrative Expenses, Selling Expenses, etc., but these are not relevant for calculating the Gross Profit Margin. The Gross Profit Margin only concerns itself with Gross Profit and Total Revenue.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter performing the calculation, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 45.76%.\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe solution should be presented in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '45.76%'} }\n```\n\n### Potential Pitfalls\n\nInitially, one might confuse Gross Profit with Net Profit or think that other expenses should be included in the calculation. However, Gross Profit Margin strictly uses Gross Profit and Total Revenue. Also, ensuring that the division is accurate and the multiplication by 100 is correctly done to convert the decimal to a percentage is crucial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully identifying the correct accounts and applying the formula, the Gross Profit Margin for the given income statement is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '45.76%'} }\n```",
