                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each calculation step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\nCalculation:\n215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.1916\n\nSo, approximately 0.19.\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed, this is the total liabilities)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,163,543.07\n\nCalculation:\n1,124,588.25 / 14,163,543.07 ≈ 0.0794\n\nSo, approximately 0.08.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets  \n(Assuming average total assets is (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2)\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 5,991,764.34\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 15,288,131.32\n\nAverage Total Assets:\n(13,000,000 + 15,288,131.32) / 2 = 14,144,065.66\n\nCalculation:\n5,991,764.34 / 14,144,065.66 ≈ 0.4235\n\nSo, approximately 0.42.\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 10,333,889.03\n- Inventory = 975,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n\nQuick Assets = 10,333,889.03 - 975,000 = 9,358,889.03\n\nCalculation:\n9,358,889.03 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 8.322\n\nSo, approximately 8.32.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n(This is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio, so same calculation.)\n\nFrom earlier:\n215,423.24 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 0.19\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity  \n(Assuming average equity is (Beginning Equity + Ending Equity) / 2)\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 1,163,543.07\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Owner's Equity = 14,163,543.07\n\nAverage Equity:\n(13,000,000 + 14,163,543.07) / 2 = 13,581,771.535\n\nCalculation:\n1,163,543.07 / 13,581,771.535 ≈ 0.0857 or 8.57%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable  \n(Assuming all sales are credit sales and average AR is (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2)\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 5,991,764.34\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 1,133,414.13\n\nAverage AR:\n(0 + 1,133,414.13) / 2 = 566,707.065\n\nCalculation:\n5,991,764.34 / 566,707.065 ≈ 10.57\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.19', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.42', 'Quick Ratio': '8.32', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.19', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '8.57%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '10.57'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify one of the calculations to ensure no mistakes. For example, the Quick Ratio:\nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 10,333,889.03 - 975,000 = 9,358,889.03\nQuick Ratio = 9,358,889.03 / 1,124,588.25 ≈ 8.32\nThis seems correct as the company has a lot of cash and receivables relative to current liabilities.\n\nSimilarly, ROE:\nNet Income = 1,163,543.07\nAverage Equity = (13,000,000 + 14,163,543.07)/2 = 13,581,771.535\nROE = 1,163,543.07 / 13,581,771.535 ≈ 0.0857 or 8.57%\nThis also seems correct given the numbers.\n\nEverything checks out!",
