These transactions represent sales that have not yet been collected in cash, thus increasing accounts receivable. \n\n### Steps to Calculate:\n1. **Filter Unpaid Sales with Account Receivable Method**: Identify all sales transactions where:\n   - `payment/receipt_status` = \"Unpaid\"\n   - `receive_method` = \"Account Receviable\"\n\n2. **Sum the After-Tax Amounts**: For these transactions, sum the `after_tax_amount` values. This represents the total increase in accounts receivable during the period.\n\n3. **Present as Negative in Cash Flow Statement**: In the cash flow statement, an increase in accounts receivable is presented as a negative value because it represents cash that has not been received (outflow of cash).\n\n### Calculation:\nFrom the provided data, the unpaid sales with account receivable method are:\n1. `Sale20240102002`: after_tax_amount = 37212.38\n2. `Sale20240103006`: after_tax_amount = 170781.88\n3. `Sale20240104010`: after_tax_amount = 53113.37\n4. `Sale20240105014`: after_tax_amount = 34395.03\n5. `Sale20240107025`: after_tax_amount = 34543.20\n6. `Sale20240108028`: after_tax_amount = 17488.21\n7. `Sale20240110037`: after_tax_amount = 25054.49\n8. `Sale20240113049`: after_tax_amount = 18132.78\n9. `Sale20240113051`: after_tax_amount = 32922.64\n10. `Sale20240116060`: after_tax_amount = 18213.06\n11. `Sale20240118068`: after_tax_amount = 9335.52\n12. `Sale20240120072`: after_tax_amount = 16940.50\n13. `Sale20240122080`: after_tax_amount = 17880.00\n14. `Sale20240122083`: after_tax_amount = 99939.04\n15. `Sale20240123087`: after_tax_amount = 17628.79\n16. `Sale20240125095`: after_tax_amount = 16203.22\n17. `Sale20240126102`: after_tax_amount = 26136.49\n18. `Sale20240127106`: after_tax_amount = 185951.33\n\nNow, sum all these amounts:\n\\[\n37212.38 + 170781.88 + 53113.37 + 34395.03 + 34543.20 + 17488.21 + 25054.49 + 18132.78 + 32922.64 + 18213.06 + 9335.52 + 16940.50 + 17880.00 + 99939.04 + 17628.79 + 16203.22 + 26136.49 + 185951.33 = 828,470.73\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe increase in accounts receivable is 828,470.73, which is presented as a negative value in the cash flow statement.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-828470.73'} }\n```",
