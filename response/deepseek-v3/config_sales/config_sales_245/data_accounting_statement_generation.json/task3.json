                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this inventory calculation problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand how much inventory we started with and how much we have at the end based on the transactions provided.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a list of transactions, and we need to calculate two things:\n1. **Inventory Initial Value**: The value of inventory at the very beginning (before any transactions).\n2. **Inventory End Value**: The value of inventory at the end after all purchases and sales have been accounted for.\n\nFrom the given data, it seems that the initial inventory value isn't explicitly stated in the transactions labeled as \"Initial\". Those seem to be about cash, bank deposits, and fixed assets, not inventory. So, it's likely that the initial inventory value is zero unless there are purchases that are considered initial inventory.\n\n### Identifying Relevant Transactions\n\nInventory is affected by two main types of transactions:\n1. **Purchases**: These increase the inventory.\n   - Look for transactions where `type` is \"Purchase\".\n   - The `amount` or `recorded_amount` represents the total cost, but since inventory is tracked by quantity and cost per unit, we might need to use `quantity` and `cost_per_unit`.\n2. **Sales**: These decrease the inventory.\n   - Look for transactions where `type` is \"Sale\".\n   - The `cost_amount` in sales tells us how much inventory was reduced by that sale (since it's the cost of goods sold).\n\n### Calculating Initial Inventory Value\n\nFrom the given transactions, there's no explicit initial inventory entry. Typically, if no initial inventory is mentioned, we assume it's zero. \n\n**Initial Inventory Value = 0.00**\n\n### Calculating Ending Inventory Value\n\nTo find the ending inventory, we'll:\n1. Sum up all purchases to get the total inventory added.\n2. Sum up all cost amounts from sales to get the total inventory sold.\n3. Subtract the total sold from the total purchased to get the ending inventory.\n\n#### Step 1: Sum of All Purchases\n\nLet's list all purchase transactions and calculate the total inventory purchased.\n\nLooking at the transactions, here are the purchases with their amounts:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 200000.0\n2. Purchase20231231002: 500000.0\n3. Purchase20231231003: 70000.0\n4. Purchase20231231004: 100000.0\n5. Purchase20231231005: 35000.0 (Unpaid, but still inventory)\n6. Purchase20231231006: 200000.0\n7. Purchase20231231007: 180000.0\n8. Purchase20231231008: 30000.0\n9. Purchase20231231009: 50000.0 (Unpaid)\n10. Purchase20231231010: 140000.0\n11. Purchase20231231011: 100000.0\n12. Purchase20231231012: 35000.0 (Unpaid)\n13. Purchase20231231013: 45000.0 (Unpaid)\n14. Purchase20231231014: 400000.0 (Unpaid)\n15. Purchase20231231015: 120000.0\n16. Purchase20231231016: 200000.0\n17. Purchase20231231017: 450000.0\n18. Purchase20231231018: 90000.0 (Unpaid)\n19. Purchase20231231019: 15000.0\n20. Purchase20231231020: 30000.0 (Unpaid)\n21. Purchase20231231021: 160000.0\n22. Purchase20231231022: 350000.0\n23. Purchase20231231023: 35000.0\n24. Purchase20231231024: 100000.0\n25. Purchase20231231025: 450000.0\n26. Purchase20231231026: 140000.0 (Unpaid)\n\nNow, let's sum all these amounts. Note that unpaid purchases are still part of inventory; they just represent amounts owed to suppliers.\n\nCalculating the sum:\n\n200,000 +\n500,000 +\n70,000 +\n100,000 +\n35,000 +\n200,000 +\n180,000 +\n30,000 +\n50,000 +\n140,000 +\n100,000 +\n35,000 +\n45,000 +\n400,000 +\n120,000 +\n200,000 +\n450,000 +\n90,000 +\n15,000 +\n30,000 +\n160,000 +\n350,000 +\n35,000 +\n100,000 +\n450,000 +\n140,000\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\n200 + 500 = 700\n700 + 70 = 770\n770 + 100 = 870\n870 + 35 = 905\n905 + 200 = 1,105\n1,105 + 180 = 1,285\n1,285 + 30 = 1,315\n1,315 + 50 = 1,365\n1,365 + 140 = 1,505\n1,505 + 100 = 1,605\n1,605 + 35 = 1,640\n1,640 + 45 = 1,685\n1,685 + 400 = 2,085\n2,085 + 120 = 2,205\n2,205 + 200 = 2,405\n2,405 + 450 = 2,855\n2,855 + 90 = 2,945\n2,945 + 15 = 2,960\n2,960 + 30 = 2,990\n2,990 + 160 = 3,150\n3,150 + 350 = 3,500\n3,500 + 35 = 3,535\n3,535 + 100 = 3,635\n3,635 + 450 = 4,085\n4,085 + 140 = 4,225\n\nTotal Purchases = 4,225,000.0\n\n#### Step 2: Sum of Cost Amounts from Sales\n\nNow, let's list all sales and their cost amounts to find out how much inventory was sold.\n\nListing all sales with cost_amount:\n\n1.
