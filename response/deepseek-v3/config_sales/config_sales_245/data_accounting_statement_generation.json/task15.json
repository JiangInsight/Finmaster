Liabilities typically include unpaid purchases (accounts payable) and any other obligations that the company has not yet settled.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Liabilities\nFrom the initial transactions (those dated 2023-12-31), we look for any unpaid purchases or other liabilities. In the given data, the initial transactions are:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0 (asset)\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0 (asset)\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0 (asset)\n- Purchase20231231001: 200,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231002: 500,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231003: 70,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231004: 100,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231005: 35,000.0 (unpaid, payment_method: Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231006: 200,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231007: 180,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231008: 30,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231009: 50,000.0 (unpaid, payment_method: Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231010: 140,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231011: 100,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231012: 35,000.0 (unpaid, payment_method: Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231013: 45,000.0 (unpaid, payment_method: Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231014: 400,000.0 (unpaid, payment_method: Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231015: 120,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231016: 200,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231017: 450,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231018: 90,000.0 (unpaid, payment_method: Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231019: 15,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231020: 30,000.0 (unpaid, payment_method: Account Payable)\n- Purchase20231231021: 160,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231022: 350,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231023: 35,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231024: 100,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231025: 450,000.0 (paid, not a liability)\n- Purchase20231231026: 140,000.0 (unpaid, payment_method: Account Payable)\n\nInitial unpaid purchases (liabilities):\n- Purchase20231231005: 35,000.0\n- Purchase20231231009: 50,000.0\n- Purchase20231231012: 35,000.0\n- Purchase20231231013: 45,000.0\n- Purchase20231231014: 400,000.0\n- Purchase20231231018: 90,000.0\n- Purchase20231231020: 30,000.0\n- Purchase20231231026: 140,000.0\n\nTotal Initial Liabilities = 35,000 + 50,000 + 35,000 + 45,000 + 400,000 + 90,000 + 30,000 + 140,000 = 825,000.0\n\n### Step 2: Identify Additional Liabilities During the Period\nFrom the transactions after 2023-12-31, we look for any new unpaid purchases or other liabilities.
