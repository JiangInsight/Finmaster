Net increase: 8,000,000.0 + 4,124,104.63 - 5,880,104.63 = 6,244,000.0\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the example provided. Let's re-calculate by considering only the net cash flows from operations, investing, and financing activities (excluding initial deposits):\n\n1. **Cash Inflows from Operations (Sales with Cash payment)**:\n   - Total: 4,124,104.63\n\n2. **Cash Outflows from Operations (Expenses with Cash payment)**:\n   - Total: 1,880,104.63 (sum of all expenses paid in cash)\n\n3. **Cash Outflows from Investing (Purchases with Cash or Bank Transfer)**:\n   - Total: 4,000,000.0 (sum of all purchases paid in cash or bank transfer)\n\n4. **Net Cash Flow**:\n   - Operations: 4,124,104.63 - 1,880,104.63 = 2,244,000.0\n   - Investing: -4,000,000.0\n   - Net increase: 2,244,000.0 - 4,000,000.0 = -1,756,000.0\n\nThis still doesn't match the example. Let's consider the initial deposits as part of the cash flow:\n\n- Initial cash deposits: 8,000,000.0\n- Net cash flow from operations and investing: -1,756,000.0\n- Total net increase: 8,000,000.0 - 1,756,000.0 = 6,244,000.0\n\nThis suggests a discrepancy. The correct approach is to sum all cash inflows and outflows, excluding non-cash items like depreciation and unpaid transactions.\n\nAfter careful re-calculation, the net increase in cash and cash equivalents is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '-1756000.00'}}\n```",
