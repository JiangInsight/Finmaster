Depreciation is typically recorded as an expense in the income statement and is listed under the \"type\" column in the transactions data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We need to find the depreciation amount from the transactions data provided. The depreciation amount is usually recorded as a separate transaction with the type \"Depreciation\".\n\n2. **Review the Transactions Data**: Look through the transactions data to find any entries where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\".\n\n3. **Locate the Depreciation Entry**: In the given data, there is a transaction with the ID \"Depreciation20240101001\" and the type \"Depreciation\". The amount for this transaction is \"45757.71\".\n\n4. **Verify the Entry**: Ensure that this is the only depreciation entry in the data. Scanning through the data confirms that there are no other entries with the type \"Depreciation\".\n\n5. **Extract the Depreciation Amount**: The amount for the depreciation entry is \"45757.71\".\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe depreciation amount to be reported in the income statement is \"45757.71\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45757.71'} }\n```",
