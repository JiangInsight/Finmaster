Sum all profits from sales transactions (where type = \"Sale\")\n2. Sum all expenses (where type contains \"Expense\" or \"Depreciation\")\n3. Sum all interest income (where type = \"Interest Receivables\")\n4. Calculate Profit Before Tax as: (Total Sales Profit) - (Total Expenses) + (Total Interest Income)\n\nLet's calculate each component:\n\n1.
