Depreciation is a non-cash expense that is typically recorded in the cash flow statement under operating activities.\n\n2. **Review the Transactions Data**: We need to look through the provided transactions to find any entry where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\".\n\n3. **Locate the Depreciation Entry**: \n   - Scanning through the transactions, we find an entry with the ID \"Depreciation20240101001\" and type \"Depreciation\".\n   - The amount for this entry is listed as \"45757.71\".\n\n4. **Verify the Entry**: \n   - The entry has a recorded date of \"2024-01-01\".\n   - There is no approver or preparer listed, which is typical for depreciation entries as they are system-generated.\n   - The amount is consistent with typical depreciation entries in financial statements.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The depreciation amount to be reported in the cash flow statement is \"45757.71\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45757.71'} }\n```",
