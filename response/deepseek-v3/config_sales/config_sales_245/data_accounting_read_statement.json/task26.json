                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value of financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation. \n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understanding Financing Costs**: Financing costs typically refer to expenses related to borrowing funds, such as interest expenses on loans or bonds. In an income statement, these are usually listed under terms like \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expenses.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing the Given Income Statement**: \n   - Look for line items that represent financing costs. In the provided income statement, there is a line item labeled \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of \"190559.73\" dated \"2024-01-29.\"\n   - This line item is the most relevant as it directly represents the costs incurred by the enterprise to raise funds.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - Ensure that \"Financial Expenses\" is indeed the correct line item by checking if it aligns with the definition of financing costs (i.e., costs related to raising funds).\n   - There are no other line items like \"Interest Expenses\" or similar, so \"Financial Expenses\" is the appropriate choice.\n\n4. **Extracting the Value**:\n   - The value associated with \"Financial Expenses\" is \"190559.73.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '190559.73'}}\n```",
