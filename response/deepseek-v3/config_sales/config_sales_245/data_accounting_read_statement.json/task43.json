This section typically includes the beginning balance, ending balance, and net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n2. **Identify the Line Item**: Within the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, find the line item labeled \"Beginning Balance\". This represents the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with the \"Beginning Balance\" line item is the amount we need to extract.\n\n4. **Verify the Date**: Ensure that the date associated with the \"Beginning Balance\" matches the period in question (2024-01-29 in this case).\n\n### Application to the Given Problem:\n- In the provided cash flow statement, under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, the \"Beginning Balance\" is listed as \"8000000.00\" with the date \"2024-01-29\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
