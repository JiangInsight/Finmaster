In income statements, this is typically labeled as \"Administrative Expenses\" or something similar.\n\n2. **Review the Given Income Statement**: Looking at the provided income statement, we can see the following line items:\n   - Main Business Revenue\n   - Total Revenue\n   - Cost of Goods Sold\n   - Total Cost\n   - Gross Profit\n   - Administrative Expenses\n   - Selling Expenses\n   - Depreciation\n   - Financial Expenses\n   - Total Expenses\n   - Interest Income\n   - Profit Before Tax\n   - Tax Expense\n   - Net Profit\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: The line item that directly corresponds to the costs of general management and administration is \"Administrative Expenses.\" \n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Administrative Expenses\" is `269591.31`.\n\n5. **Verify**: Ensure that \"Administrative Expenses\" is indeed the correct line item for general management and administration costs. This is confirmed by standard accounting practices where administrative expenses cover costs like salaries of management, office supplies, and other overhead costs not directly tied to production or sales.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '269591.31'}}\n```",
