COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given income statement, we look for the line item labeled \"Cost of Goods Sold.\" \n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the amount we need to extract. \n\n4. **Verify the Line Item**: Ensure that \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is indeed the correct line item representing the carrying amount of inventories sold. This is confirmed by standard accounting practices where COGS directly relates to the cost of inventory sold during the period.\n\n5. **Check for Other Possibilities**: Sometimes, the line item might be labeled differently (e.g., \"Cost of Sales\"), but in this case, it is clearly labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n### Solution:\nFrom the given income statement, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed with an amount of `3250000.00`. This is the value we need to extract.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3250000.00'} }\n```",
