This account typically represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\n2. **Extract the initial value**: The initial amount for \"Paid-in Capital\" is listed as \"13000000.00\" with the initial date \"2023-12-31.\"\n\n3. **Extract the end value**: The end amount for \"Paid-in Capital\" is listed as \"13000000.00\" with the end date \"2024-01-29.\"\n\n4. **Verify consistency**: The initial and end values for \"Paid-in Capital\" are the same, indicating no additional capital was contributed during the period.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
