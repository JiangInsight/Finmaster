This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity for credit sales or services provided.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-1133414.13\". A negative value here indicates an increase in accounts receivable (meaning less cash was collected than the sales made on credit), but the line item itself represents the change in accounts receivable, which is what we are asked to extract.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The line item is correctly identified as it directly relates to the amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1133414.13'}}\n```",
