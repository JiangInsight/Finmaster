This line item is typically called \"Retained Earnings.\"\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet, we can see the following entries for \"Retained Earnings\":\n\n- Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- End_amount: 1163543.07 (as of 2024-01-29)\n\nThese values indicate the initial and final amounts of retained earnings over the period.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1163543.07'} }\n```",
