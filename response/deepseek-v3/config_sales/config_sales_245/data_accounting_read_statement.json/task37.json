This line item is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the value associated with depreciation in the cash flow statement. Depreciation represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n2. **Locate the Depreciation Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item labeled \"Depreciation\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n3. **Extract the Value**: Once located, note the amount associated with the \"Depreciation\" line item.\n4. **Verify the Date**: Ensure that the date associated with the depreciation value matches the date in the problem statement (2024-01-29 in this case).\n\n### Application to the Given Problem:\n- In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Depreciation\" line item is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" with an amount of `45757.71` and a date of `2024-01-29`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45757.71'}}\n```",
