Additionally, we need to decompose this item into 1 component sub-item, all of which must also originate from the input statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Total Income from Ordinary Activities**: \n   - The total income from ordinary activities is typically represented by \"Total Revenue\" in the income statement. \n   - In the given problem, \"Total Revenue\" is listed with an amount of \"5991764.34\".\n\n2. **Identify Constituent Line Items**:\n   - The constituent line item that makes up the \"Total Revenue\" is \"Main Business Revenue\", which is also listed with the same amount of \"5991764.34\". This indicates that \"Main Business Revenue\" is the sole component of \"Total Revenue\".\n\n3. **Decompose into Sub-Items**:\n   - Since the task requires decomposing the total income into 1 component sub-item, we will use \"Main Business Revenue\" as the sub-item. \n   - The initial and final values for the sub-item are the same, as there is only one sub-item and no further breakdown is provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"5991764.34\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"5991764.34\"}}}\n```",
