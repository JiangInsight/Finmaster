This is because selling expenses include costs associated with marketing, sales commissions, shipping, and other activities directly tied to generating and fulfilling customer orders.\n\n2. **Reviewing the Income Statement**: \n   - The income statement provided includes a line item labeled \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of \"782775.93\".\n   - Other line items like \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Depreciation\", and \"Financial Expenses\" are not directly related to securing orders or delivering goods/services.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - \"Administrative Expenses\" are general overhead costs not tied to sales or delivery.\n   - \"Depreciation\" is a non-cash expense related to asset usage.\n   - \"Financial Expenses\" are related to borrowing costs.\n   - Only \"Selling Expenses\" fits the description of costs for securing orders and delivery.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value to extract is the amount under \"Selling Expenses\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '782775.93'}}\n```",
