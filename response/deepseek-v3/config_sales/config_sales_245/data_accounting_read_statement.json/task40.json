This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is captured by the \"Accounts Payable\" line in the cash flow statement, as it represents the amount the entity owes to its suppliers or creditors.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is present under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section. The amount for this line item is \"825000.00\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: The positive value indicates an increase in accounts payable, meaning the entity owes more at the end of the period compared to the beginning, which aligns with the task description.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value to be extracted is \"825000.00\".\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '825000.00'} }\n```",
