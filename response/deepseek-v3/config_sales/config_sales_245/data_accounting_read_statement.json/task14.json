These are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the entity's normal operating cycle, usually within one year. In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are:\n     - Accounts Payable\n     - Taxes Payable\n     - Total Current Liabilities\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" line item provides the aggregate value of all current liabilities at the initial and end dates.\n   - From the table:\n     - **Initial_amount**: The initial value of \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n     - **End_amount**: The end value of \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `1124588.25` as of `2024-01-29`.\n\n3. **Verify Line Items**:\n   - The individual current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable) sum up to the \"Total Current Liabilities\":\n     - Accounts Payable: `825000.00`\n     - Taxes Payable: `299588.25`\n     - Total: `825000.00 + 299588.25 = 1124588.25` (matches \"Total Current Liabilities\").\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1124588.25'} }\n```",
