Since we only need values from the Balance Sheet and Income Statement, we ignore the Cash Flow Statement for this task.\n   - Within each group, we maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n- `value1` (Bank Deposits): `3655000.00`\n- `value2` (Interest Income): `10051.66`\n\n### JSON Format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3655000.00', 'value2': '10051.66'} }\n```",
