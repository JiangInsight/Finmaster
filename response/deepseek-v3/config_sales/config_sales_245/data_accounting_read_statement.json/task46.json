I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's look at the task description:\n\nWe need to identify and extract specific line items from the cash flow statement related to:\n1. The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities involving:\n   - Acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents.\n   - Receipt of interest and dividends.\n   \nAdditionally, we need to decompose this item into 1 component sub-item, both of which must come from the input statement. Then, we'll output the final value of the main item and its sub-item.\n\n### Analyzing the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- The main item is \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a value of \"-305354.43\".\n- The sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of \"305354.43\".\n\nThis makes sense because:\n- Investing activities typically include purchases of fixed assets (like property, plant, and equipment).\n- The net cash flow from investing is the sum of all investing activities, which in the example is just the purchase of fixed assets (hence the negative sign indicating cash outflow).\n\n### Applying to the Given Problem\n\nNow, let's look at the problem we need to solve. Here's the cash flow statement provided:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Profit  | 1163543.07 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Depreciation  | 45757.71 | 2024-01-29 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -1133414.13 | 2024-01-29 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -10051.66 | 2024-01-29 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -975000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 825000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 299588.25 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | 215423.24 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Ending Balance  | 8215423.24 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Increase  | 215423.24 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nFrom this, we're interested in the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n\n### Identifying the Main Item\n\nThe main item is \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", which is given as \"-0.00\". \n\n### Identifying the Sub-item\n\nThe sub-item under investing activities is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\", which is \"0.00\". \n\nThis is the only line item under investing activities in this statement, similar to the example where \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" was the sub-item.\n\n### Verifying the Values\n\n- Main item (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities): -0.00\n- Sub-item (Purchase of Fixed Assets): 0.00\n\nThis makes sense because if the purchase is 0, the net cash flow from investing is also 0 (or -0.00, which is effectively 0).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Section**: Look for \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" in the statement.\n2. **Find the Main Item**: Within investing activities, the net cash flow is given as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n   - Value: -0.00\n3. **Find Sub-items**: Under investing activities, identify the line items that contribute to the net cash flow.\n   - Here, it's \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with value 0.00.\n4. **Ensure Completeness**: Confirm that all sub-items are accounted for (only one in this case).\n5. **Format the Answer**: Present the main value and sub-item value in the specified JSON format.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the cash flow statement and following the example's structure, the solution is straightforward since the investing activities section is minimal in this case.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '0.00'}}}\n```",
