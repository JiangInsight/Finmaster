                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement extraction task step by step. I'm going to go through each part of the problem to identify and extract the three specific line items as described.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to extract three specific values from the provided financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" during the period, which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\nThe order to present these values is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### Extracting the Values\n\nLet's go through each financial statement one by one.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we're interested in the capital contributed by shareholders. This is typically labeled as \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\nHere, the \"End_amount\" is `13000000.00`, which hasn't changed from the initial amount. This suggests no new capital was contributed during this period. However, since the task asks for capital contributed, and it's the same, it might imply this is the total capital. Alternatively, if there was an increase, we'd look at the difference, but here it's static. \n\nGiven the example, it seems we take the \"End_amount\" of \"Paid-in Capital\" as 'value1'.\n\nSo, `'value1': '13000000.00'`\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNext, we need the profit or loss before tax. This is clearly labeled as \"Profit Before Tax\" in the Income Statement.\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n```\nProfit Before Tax | 1463131.32 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\nSo, `'value2': '1463131.32'`\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, we need the addition in the amount owed for goods/services on credit, which is the increase in \"Accounts Payable\". This is found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 825000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\nThis indicates that Accounts Payable increased by `825000.00` during the period.\n\nSo, `'value3': '825000.00'`\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure we're doing this correctly:\n\n- 'value1' was \"Paid-in Capital\" from Balance Sheet: `13000000.00`\n- 'value2' was \"Profit Before Tax\" from Income Statement: `-1373590.51`\n- 'value3' was \"Increase in Accounts Payable\" from Cash Flow: `1590000.00`\n\nThis matches our approach.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1463131.32', 'value3': '825000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**: Located \"Paid-in Capital\" with an end amount of `13000000.00` → 'value1'.\n2. **Income Statement**: Found \"Profit Before Tax\" as `1463131.32` → 'value2'.\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**: Identified \"Increase in Accounts Payable\" as `825000.00` → 'value3'.\n\nThus, the final JSON output is as above.",
