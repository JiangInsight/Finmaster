These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as `5000000.00` on the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as `5000000.00` on the end date `2024-01-29`.\n\n4. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Although \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is listed, it is a contra-asset account that reduces the book value of fixed assets. However, the task asks for the value of the tangible items themselves, not their net book value. Therefore, we use the gross value of \"Fixed Assets\" as provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'} }\n```",
