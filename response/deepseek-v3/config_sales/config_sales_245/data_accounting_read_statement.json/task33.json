                        "content": "### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task requires us to identify and extract two specific line items from an income statement:\n\n1. **Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities**: This typically refers to the revenue generated from the main business operations of the company. In income statements, this is often labeled as \"Main Business Revenue,\" \"Sales Revenue,\" or similar terms indicating the primary source of income.\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This refers to the cost associated with the goods that were sold to generate the revenue mentioned above. In accounting terms, this is commonly known as the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS). It represents the direct costs attributable to the production or purchase of the goods sold by the company.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided income statement:\n\n| Account                 | Amount     | Date       |\n|-------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Main Business Revenue   | 5991764.34 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Revenue           | 5991764.34 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold      | 3250000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Cost              | 3250000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Gross Profit            | 2741764.34 | 2024-01-29 |\n| ... (other expenses)    | ...        | ...        |\n\nFrom this:\n\n1. **Main Business Revenue**: Clearly listed as \"Main Business Revenue\" with an amount of `5991764.34`.\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold**: Listed as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with an amount of `3250000.00`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nThe example provided in the task description helps confirm our understanding:\n\n- **Example Input**:\n  - Main Business Revenue: 5431018.59\n  - Cost of Goods Sold: 4410000.00\n- **Example Output**:\n  - `{'value1': '5431018.59', 'value2': '4410000.00'}`\n\nThis shows that `value1` corresponds to \"Main Business Revenue\" and `value2` corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\n### Potential Confusions\n\nOne might wonder why \"Total Revenue\" isn't chosen over \"Main Business Revenue.\" However, \"Total Revenue\" can sometimes include other income sources not directly tied to core operations (like interest income, rental income, etc.). Since the task specifies \"core operating activities,\" \"Main Business Revenue\" is the more precise choice.\n\nSimilarly, \"Total Cost\" might seem like a candidate for the second value, but it can include costs beyond just the inventory sold (like operating expenses). \"Cost of Goods Sold\" directly relates to the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nGiven the above analysis, for the provided income statement:\n\n- `value1` (Main Business Revenue): `5991764.34`\n- `value2` (Cost of Goods Sold): `3250000.00`\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5991764.34', 'value2': '3250000.00'} }\n```",
