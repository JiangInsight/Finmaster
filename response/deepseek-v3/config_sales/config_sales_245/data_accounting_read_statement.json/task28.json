We are interested in the line item that represents the tax expense.\n\n2. **Identify the Tax Expense Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item labeled \"Tax Expense\" represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period.\n\n3. **Locate the Amount for Tax Expense**: The amount corresponding to \"Tax Expense\" is `299588.25` as shown in the table.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Tax Expense\" is listed after \"Profit Before Tax\" and before \"Net Profit,\" which is the standard placement in an income statement. This confirms that this is indeed the tax amount for the reporting period.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period is `299588.25`.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '299588.25'} }\n```",
