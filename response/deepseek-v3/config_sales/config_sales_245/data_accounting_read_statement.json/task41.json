In cash flow statements, this is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n   \n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided problem, we can see the following line items under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\":\n   - Net Profit\n   - Depreciation\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n   - **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value corresponding to \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is `299588.25`.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The value is positive, which indicates an increase in tax payable (i.e., tax accrued but not yet paid). This matches the task's requirement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '299588.25'}}\n```",
