                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what exactly we're being asked to find and then locate those values in the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract two specific line items and their corresponding values from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.**\n2. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.**\n\nWe need to look for these in the given financial statements, which are grouped in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\n### Identifying the Relevant Line Items\n\nLet's interpret what each of these line items might correspond to in the financial statements:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers:**\n   - This sounds like it could be related to \"Selling Expenses\" in the Income Statement. Selling expenses typically include costs associated with marketing, sales commissions, and delivering products to customers.\n   \n2. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets:**\n   - This is likely to be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar, which represents cash outflows for acquiring long-term assets.\n\n### Locating the Values in the Financial Statements\n\nNow, let's go through each financial statement to find these items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided, the line items are mostly about assets, liabilities, and equity. I don't see anything directly related to the costs of securing orders or delivering goods, nor about cash payments for long-term assets. These are more likely to be in the Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement, respectively.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\nHere's the Income Statement part:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 5991764.34 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Revenue | 5991764.34 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 3250000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Cost | 3250000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Gross Profit | 2741764.34 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 269591.31 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Selling Expenses | 782775.93 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Depreciation | 45757.71 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Financial Expenses | 190559.73 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Expenses | 1288684.68 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Interest Income | 10051.66 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 1463131.32 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Tax Expense | 299588.25 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Profit | 1163543.07 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nThe \"Selling Expenses\" line seems to match our first required item: costs to secure orders and deliver goods/services. The amount here is **782775.93**.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nNow, the Cash Flow Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Profit  | 1163543.07 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Depreciation  | 45757.71 | 2024-01-29 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -1133414.13 | 2024-01-29 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -10051.66 | 2024-01-29 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -975000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 825000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 299588.25 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | 215423.24 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Ending Balance  | 8215423.24 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Increase  | 215423.24 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nHere, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" corresponds to cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment. The amount here is **0.00**.\n\n### Verifying the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure I'm on the right track:\n\n- The first value was \"Selling Expenses\" from the Income Statement (493854.67).\n- The second value was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" from the Cash Flow Statement (305354.43).\n\nThis matches my approach, so I'm confident in proceeding similarly.\n\n### Finalizing the Values\n\nFrom the current problem:\n\n1. **Costs to secure orders and deliver goods/services**: \"Selling Expenses\" = 782775.93\n2. **Cash payments for long-term assets**: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = 0.00\n\n### Potential Confusion\n\nInitially, I wondered if \"Administrative Expenses\" could also be part of the first item, but the example clearly points to \"Selling Expenses\" as the correct line item. Also, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" being zero might seem odd, but if no purchases were made in that period, it's accurate.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '782775.93', 'value2': '0.00'}}\n```",
