This account records interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial Value**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, under the \"Account\" column, we find \"Interest Receivable\".\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Interest Receivable\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Locate the End Value**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Interest Receivable\" is `10051.66` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-29`.\n\n4. **Verify with Other Statements**:\n   - The income statement confirms this with \"Interest Income\" of `10051.66`, which matches the increase in \"Interest Receivable\".\n   - The cash flow statement shows a decrease in \"Interest Receivable\" of `-10051.66`, indicating that this amount was accrued but not yet received in cash.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '10051.66'} }\n```",
