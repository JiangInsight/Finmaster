These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are those that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle (usually one year). In the given balance sheet, the non-current assets are:\n     - Fixed Assets\n     - Accumulated Depreciation\n     - Total Non-current Assets\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item represents the aggregate of non-current assets. This is the value we are interested in.\n   - From the table:\n     - **Initial value**: The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `5000000.00`.\n     - **End value**: The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `4954242.29`.\n\n3. **Verify**:\n   - The initial and end values for \"Total Non-current Assets\" are consistent with the definition of assets not expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4954242.29'} }\n```",
