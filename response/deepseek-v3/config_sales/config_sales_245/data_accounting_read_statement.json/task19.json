I'm going to go through the balance sheet provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their initial and end amounts. \n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract four specific line items from the balance sheet:\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically listed as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n2. **Accumulated depreciation**: This is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, usually listed as \"Accumulated Depreciation\".\n3. **Tax payable**: This is the amount of taxes that the company owes but hasn't paid yet, listed as \"Taxes Payable\".\n4. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is the amount shareholders have invested in the company, usually listed as \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\nFor each of these, we'll note the \"Initial_amount\" and \"End_amount\" from the table.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Balance Sheet\nLet's go through the table line by line to find these items.\n\n1. **Interest Receivable**:\n   - Found in the table as:\n     | Interest Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 10051.66 | 2024-01-29 |\n   - Initial value: 0.00\n   - End value: 10051.66\n\n2. **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Found in the table as:\n     | Accumulated Depreciation | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 45757.71 | 2024-01-29 |\n   - Initial value: 0.00\n   - End value: 45757.71\n\n3. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - Found in the table as:\n     | Taxes Payable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 299588.25 | 2024-01-29 |\n   - Initial value: 0.00\n   - End value: 299588.25\n\n4. **Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Found in the table as:\n     | Paid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n   - Initial value: 13000000.00\n   - End value: 13000000.00\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe order in which these items appear in the table is:\n1. Interest Receivable\n2. Accumulated Depreciation\n3. Taxes Payable\n4. Paid-in Capital\n\nThis matches the order we're supposed to maintain in the output.\n\n### Constructing the Solution\nNow, let's assign these values to the corresponding keys in the solution JSON:\n\n- 'initial value1': Interest Receivable initial amount → '0.00'\n- 'end valu1': Interest Receivable end amount → '10051.66'\n- 'initial value2': Accumulated Depreciation initial amount → '0.00'\n- 'end valu2': Accumulated Depreciation end amount → '45757.71'\n- 'initial value3': Taxes Payable initial amount → '0.00'\n- 'end valu3': Taxes Payable end amount → '299588.25'\n- 'initial value4': Paid-in Capital initial amount → '13000000.00'\n- 'end valu4': Paid-in Capital end amount → '13000000.00'\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '10051.66', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '45757.71', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '299588.25', 'initial value4': '13000000.00', 'end valu4': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
