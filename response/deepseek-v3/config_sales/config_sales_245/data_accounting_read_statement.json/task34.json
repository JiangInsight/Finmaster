                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to look at the income statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Terms\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these terms typically refers to in an income statement:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This usually refers to the total revenue generated from the main operations of the business. In income statements, this is often labeled as \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold during the period. It's commonly referred to as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the overhead costs not directly tied to production or sales. They're usually listed as \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\n### Step 2: Matching Terms to the Given Income Statement\n\nNow, let's look at the provided income statement and match these terms:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 5991764.34 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Revenue | 5991764.34 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 3250000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Cost | 3250000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Gross Profit | 2741764.34 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 269591.31 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Selling Expenses | 782775.93 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Depreciation | 45757.71 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Financial Expenses | 190559.73 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Expenses | 1288684.68 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Interest Income | 10051.66 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 1463131.32 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Tax Expense | 299588.25 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Profit | 1163543.07 | 2024-01-29 |\n\n1. **Total income from ordinary activities**:\n   - Both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" seem to represent the total income from ordinary activities. They have the same amount, which is common because \"Total Revenue\" often sums up all revenue streams, and if \"Main Business Revenue\" is the only one, they'll match.\n   - For consistency with the example provided, where \"Total Revenue\" was chosen, we'll go with \"Total Revenue\": **5991764.34**\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold (COGS)**:\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is clearly listed: **3250000.00**\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration**:\n   - \"Administrative Expenses\" is the line item that matches this description: **269591.31**\n\n### Step 3: Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- `value1` was \"Total Revenue\" (5431018.59)\n- `value2` was \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (4410000.00)\n- `value3` was \"Administrative Expenses\" (1425164.20)\n\nThis confirms our approach is correct.\n\n### Step 4: Finalizing the Answer\n\nNow, plugging in the values from the current problem:\n\n- `value1`: Total Revenue → 5991764.34\n- `value2`: Cost of Goods Sold → 3250000.00\n- `value3`: Administrative Expenses → 269591.31\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5991764.34', 'value2': '3250000.00', 'value3': '269591.31'} }\n```",
