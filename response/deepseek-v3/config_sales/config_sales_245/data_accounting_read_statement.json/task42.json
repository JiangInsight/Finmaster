The line item we are interested in, which represents cash payments for PP&E and other long-term assets, is typically found under the \"Investing Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: Within the \"Investing Activities\" section, look for a line item that describes the purchase or acquisition of fixed assets, PP&E, or other long-term assets. Common labels include \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" \"Capital Expenditures,\" or \"Acquisition of Property, Plant, and Equipment.\"\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: Once the relevant line item is identified, extract the corresponding amount. \n\n### Applying to the Given Problem:\n- In the provided cash flow statement, under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section, the line item is labeled \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of `0.00` on the date `2024-01-29`.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets is `0.00`.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
