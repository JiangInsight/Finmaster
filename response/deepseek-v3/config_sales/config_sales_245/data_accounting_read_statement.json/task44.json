We are interested in the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n2. **Identify the Line Item**: Within the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, there are three line items: \"Beginning Balance\", \"Ending Balance\", and \"Net Increase\". The \"Ending Balance\" represents the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period, which is the value we need to extract.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: From the table, the \"Ending Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section is \"8215423.24\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8215423.24'} }\n```",
