This is typically listed under \"Accounts Payable\" in the liabilities section of the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify the relevant line item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Payable\" represents the amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is the item we need to extract.\n\n2. **Locate \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, \"Accounts Payable\" is listed under the \"Account\" column.\n   - The initial amount for \"Accounts Payable\" is `0.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - The end amount for \"Accounts Payable\" is `825000.00` as of the end date `2024-01-29`.\n\n3. **Extract the values**:\n   - Initial value: `0.00`\n   - End value: `825000.00`\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '825000.00'} }\n```",
