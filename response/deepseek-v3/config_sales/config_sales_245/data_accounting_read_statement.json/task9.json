This is typically listed under \"Taxes Payable\" in the liabilities section. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant line item**: Look for \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet. This line item represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Extract the initial value**: The initial amount for \"Taxes Payable\" is listed as \"0.00\" with the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract the end value**: The end amount for \"Taxes Payable\" is listed as \"299588.25\" with the end date \"2024-01-29\".\n\n4. **Construct the solution**: The initial value is \"0.00\" and the end value is \"299588.25\".\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '299588.25'} }\n```",
