Looking at the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, we see \"Net Increase\" with a value of \"215423.24\". This is our main value.\n\n2. Next, we need to decompose this into 2 sub-items that are involved in its calculation. Looking at the same section, we see:\n   - \"Beginning Balance\": 8000000.00\n   - \"Ending Balance\": 8215423.24\n\n3. These two sub-items are used to calculate the net increase:\n   Net Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance\n   215423.24 = 8215423.24 - 8000000.00\n\n4. All these values come from the input statement as required.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '215423.24', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '8215423.24'}}}\n```",
