This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the amounts owed by customers for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet. This is the standard account that tracks amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" column shows the value at the \"Initial_date\" (2023-12-31 in this case).\n   - The \"End_amount\" column shows the value at the \"End_date\" (2024-01-29 in this case).\n\n3. **Locate the Values in the Given Problem**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, the \"Accounts Receivable\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 1133414.13 (as of 2024-01-29)\n\n4. **Prepare the Solution**:\n   - The initial value is '0.00'.\n   - The end value is '1133414.13'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1133414.13'} }\n```",
