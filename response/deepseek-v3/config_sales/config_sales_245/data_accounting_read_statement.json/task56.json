                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value of the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Task**: The task asks for the value of depreciation, which is the systematic allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life. This value can be found in the financial statements under \"Depreciation.\"\n\n2. **Locating Depreciation in the Financial Statements**:\n   - **Balance Sheet**: The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item shows the total depreciation accumulated over time. In the given balance sheet, the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" at the end date is `45757.71`.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" shows the depreciation expense for the period, which is `45757.71`.\n   - **Income Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item under expenses shows the depreciation expense for the period, which is `45757.71`.\n\n3. **Verification**: All three sections (balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) consistently report the same depreciation value of `45757.71` for the period. This confirms that the correct value to extract is `45757.71`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of depreciation for the period is `45757.71`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45757.71'}}\n```",
