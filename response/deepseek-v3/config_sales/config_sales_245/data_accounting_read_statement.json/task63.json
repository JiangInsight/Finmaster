                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Taxes accrued but not yet paid**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Taxes Payable.\"\n2. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This is usually the \"Total Revenue\" from the Income Statement.\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities**: This is the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order to present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Taxes Payable\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided, there's a line item called \"Taxes Payable\" with an \"End_amount\" of `299588.25`. This represents the taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid as of the end date.\n\n**Value1: 299588.25**\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Total Revenue\nIn the Income Statement, \"Total Revenue\" is listed as `5991764.34`. This is the total income from the entity's ordinary activities.\n\n**Value2: 5991764.34**\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is `215423.24`. This is the net cash generated from the principal revenue-producing activities.\n\n**Value3: 215423.24**\n\n### Verifying the Order\nJust to ensure, the order is:\n1. Balance Sheet (Taxes Payable)\n2. Income Statement (Total Revenue)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities)\n\nThis matches the order in the example provided.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '299588.25', 'value2': '5991764.34', 'value3': '215423.24'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Balance Sheet**: Located \"Taxes Payable\" under current liabilities → `299588.25`.\n2. **Income Statement**: Found \"Total Revenue\" → `5991764.34`.\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**: Identified \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" → `215423.24`.\n4. Arranged in the specified order and formatted into JSON.\n\nThis should correctly solve the given problem.",
