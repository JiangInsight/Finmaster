I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in. \n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the cash flow statement:\n1. The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period. This typically refers to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n2. The acquisition of property, plant, and equipment. This is usually listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n3. Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period, which is the \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Given Cash Flow Statement\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement and find these items.\n\n1. **Increase in Accounts Payable**:\n   - Scanning the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, we see:\n     - \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with an amount of \"825000.00\".\n   - This represents the increase in the amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**:\n   - Under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" there's:\n     - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of \"0.00\".\n   - This indicates that there was no acquisition of property, plant, or equipment during this period.\n\n3. **Cash and Cash Equivalents at Beginning of Period**:\n   - In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section:\n     - \"Beginning Balance\" is \"8000000.00\".\n   - This is the starting amount of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the example provided:\n- 'value1' was \"1590000.00\" from \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n- 'value2' was \"305354.43\" from \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n- 'value3' was \"8000000.00\" from \"Beginning Balance\".\n\nThis confirms that we're looking at the correct line items.\n\n### Extracting the Values\nFrom the current problem:\n1. Increase in Accounts Payable: 825000.00\n2. Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n3. Beginning Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents: 8000000.00\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '825000.00', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. Identified \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" as the first required item: 825000.00.\n2. Located \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" for the second item: 0.00.\n3. Found \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" for the third item: 8000000.00.\n4. Verified the line items by comparing with the example.\n5. Compiled the values into the specified JSON format.\n\nThis should correctly answer the task based on the given cash flow statement.",
