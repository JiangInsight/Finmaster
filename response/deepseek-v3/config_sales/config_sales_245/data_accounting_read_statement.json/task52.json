This information is typically found in the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item under the \"Owner's Equity\" section of the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate the Balance Sheet**: The balance sheet is provided in the problem statement.\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: We are looking for \"Paid-in Capital\" or a similar line item that represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: This is the value under the \"Initial_amount\" column for \"Paid-in Capital\".\n   - **End Value**: This is the value under the \"End_amount\" column for \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet:\n- **Paid-in Capital**:\n  - Initial_amount: 13000000.00\n  - End_amount: 13000000.00\n\n### Solution:\nThe initial and end values of the capital contributed by shareholders are both 13000000.00, as there was no change in the paid-in capital during the period.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
