These assets are typically categorized under \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents assets held for sale or in production is \"Inventory\". This is because inventory includes goods that are either finished and ready for sale, in the process of being manufactured, or in production for sale.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Amount**: The initial value of \"Inventory\" is listed as \"0.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n   - **End Amount**: The end value of \"Inventory\" is listed as \"975000.00\" on the end date \"2024-01-29\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The \"Inventory\" line item is the only one that fits the description of assets held for sale or in production. Other line items like \"Cash on Hand\", \"Bank Deposits\", etc., do not meet this criteria.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '975000.00'} }\n```",
