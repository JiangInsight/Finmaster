I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe're given a cash flow statement, and we need to extract specific information from it. Here's what the task is asking for:\n\n1. **Identify and extract the specific line item and value**:\n   - This refers to the \"net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends.\"\n   - In simpler terms, this is typically the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" in a cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Decompose this item into 1 component sub-item**:\n   - This means we need to find one line item that contributes to the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n   - From the example, it seems the sub-item is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is a part of the investing activities.\n\n3. **Output the final value for the main item and its sub-item**:\n   - We need to provide the value for \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" and its sub-item (\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\").\n\n### Analyzing the Given Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 3744117.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 120970.16 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -14921566.06 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -14887.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -7400000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 6600000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 1428630.43 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -10442735.47 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Cash Flow from Investing Activities** |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Purchase of Fixed Assets**  | **2479994.53** | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**  | **-2479994.53** | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 20000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 7077270.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -12922730.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nFrom this, the relevant parts are under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\":\n\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 2479994.53\n- **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: -2479994.53\n\n### Identifying the Main Item and Sub-item\n\n1. **Main Item**: \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is the net amount we're interested in. Its value is -2479994.53.\n2. **Sub-item**: The only component listed under investing activities is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is 2479994.53. This is the amount spent on purchasing fixed assets, which is why the net cash flow is negative (cash outflow).\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-305354.43', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '305354.43'}}}\n```\n\n- The main value was \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": -305354.43\n- The sub-item was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": 305354.43\n\nThis matches our understanding.\n\n### Constructing the Solution\n\nFor our problem:\n\n- **value**: \"-2479994.53\" (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities)\n- **sub_items_sub_item value**: \"2479994.53\" (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\nSo, the solution in the required JSON format would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2479994.53', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '2479994.53'} }\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2479994.53', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '2479994.53'} }\n```",
