This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Receivable\" represents money owed to the entity by customers for goods or services sold on credit. This is the item we are interested in.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the \"Initial_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is `14921566.06` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n4. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00`, and the end value is `14921566.06`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '14921566.06'} }\n```",
