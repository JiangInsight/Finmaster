                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement extraction task step by step. I'm going to identify and extract three specific line items from the given financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three values:\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares** (from the Balance Sheet)\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense** (from the Income Statement)\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period** (from the Cash Flow Statement)\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Financial Statements\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we need to find \"capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\" This is typically represented as \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Share Capital.\"\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 28000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 28000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis seems to be the capital contributed by shareholders. The end amount is `28000000.00`.\n\n**Value1: 28000000.00**\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\nNext, from the Income Statement, we need \"profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense.\" This is usually labeled as \"Profit Before Tax\" or \"Income Before Tax.\"\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n```\nProfit Before Tax | 5172748.32 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis is the profit before tax expense. The amount is `5172748.32`.\n\n**Value2: 5172748.32**\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nNow, from the Cash Flow Statement, we need the \"addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\" This refers to the increase in accounts payable during the period.\n\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, changes in accounts payable are usually listed under operating activities as \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 6600000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis shows an increase in accounts payable by `6600000.00`.\n\n**Value3: 6600000.00**\n\n### Verifying the Values\nLet's double-check each value to ensure accuracy:\n\n1. **Paid-in Capital**: Confirmed as `28000000.00` in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Profit Before Tax**: Confirmed as `5172748.32` in the Income Statement.\n3. **Increase in Accounts Payable**: Confirmed as `6600000.00` in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nAll values align with the definitions and are correctly extracted from their respective statements.\n\n### Final Answer\nCombining these, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '5172748.32', 'value3': '6600000.00'}}\n```",
