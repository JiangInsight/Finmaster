This typically refers to the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item in the cash flow statement, as it represents changes in the amount owed for credit purchases.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the value that represents the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services purchased on credit. This is directly related to the \"Accounts Payable\" line in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item labeled \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is the amount by which the accounts payable have increased during the period. A positive value indicates an increase in the amount owed (i.e., more goods or services were purchased on credit), while a negative value would indicate a decrease.\n\nIn the given problem:\n- The line item is: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with an amount of \"6600000.00\". This is the value we need to extract.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6600000.00'}}\n```",
