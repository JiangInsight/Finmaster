This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understanding Depreciation**: Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. It appears in multiple parts of the financial statements:\n   - **Balance Sheet**: Under \"Accumulated Depreciation\" (a contra-asset account that reduces the value of fixed assets).\n   - **Income Statement**: As an expense line item called \"Depreciation\".\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: Added back to net profit in the operating activities section (since it is a non-cash expense).\n\n2. **Locating Depreciation in the Given Problem**:\n   - **Balance Sheet**: The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" shows an end amount of `120970.16` as of `2024-02-05`. This represents the total depreciation accumulated up to that date.\n   - **Income Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item shows `120970.16` for the period ending `2024-02-05`. This represents the depreciation expense for the period.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item under operating activities also shows `120970.16`, which matches the income statement value.\n\n3. **Choosing the Correct Value**:\n   - The task asks for the \"systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life,\" which is the depreciation expense for the period. This is explicitly listed in the income statement and cash flow statement as `120970.16`.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The value is consistent across the income statement and cash flow statement, confirming its accuracy.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '120970.16'} }\n```",
