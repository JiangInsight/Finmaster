In the cash flow statement, this is typically represented by the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given problem, the line item is labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of \"1428630.43\" on the date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: The line item is correctly placed under the operating activities section, which is where changes in tax payable (accrued taxes) are usually reported.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with the increase in tax payable is \"1428630.43\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1428630.43'} }\n```",
