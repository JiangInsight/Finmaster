                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line items and values of cash held by the entity that is available for use in its day-to-day operations. This typically includes \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" as these are the most liquid assets readily available for daily operations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**:\n   - The balance sheet provided includes \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" which are the primary components of cash available for day-to-day operations.\n   - Other items like \"Interest Receivable\", \"Accounts Receivable\", and \"Inventory\" are not considered as cash available for immediate use.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Values**:\n   - The initial value for \"Cash on Hand\" is `5000000.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - The initial value for \"Bank Deposits\" is `15000000.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - The total initial cash available is the sum of these two values: `5000000.00 + 15000000.00 = 20000000.00`.\n\n3. **Extract End Values**:\n   - The end value for \"Cash on Hand\" is `6057264.53` as of `2024-02-05`.\n   - The end value for \"Bank Deposits\" is `1020005.47` as of `2024-02-05`.\n   - The total end cash available is the sum of these two values: `6057264.53 + 1020005.47 = 7077270.00`.\n\n4. **Verify Against Total Current Assets**:\n   - The \"Total Current Assets\" initial value is `20000000.00`, which matches the sum of initial cash (`20000000.00`). This confirms our calculation is correct.\n   - The \"Total Current Assets\" end value is `29413723.95`, which includes other current assets like receivables and inventory, so it is higher than the end cash value.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value of cash available for day-to-day operations is `20000000.00`.\n   - The end value of cash available for day-to-day operations is `7077270.00`.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '20000000.00', 'end value': '7077270.00'}}\n```",
