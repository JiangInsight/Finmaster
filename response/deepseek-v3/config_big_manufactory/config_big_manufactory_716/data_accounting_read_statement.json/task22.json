In the given problem, it is listed as \"Total Revenue\" with an amount of \"28572608.70\".\n   - **Total Cost**: This is the total cost associated with generating the revenue. In the given problem, it is listed as \"Total Cost\" with an amount of \"20200000.00\".\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference Between Revenue and Cost**:\n   - The difference between revenue and cost is typically referred to as \"Gross Profit\" in an income statement. This is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross Profit} = 28572608.70 - 20200000.00 = 8372608.70\n     \\]\n\n3. **Verify with the Given Data**:\n   - The income statement already includes a line item for \"Gross Profit\" with the amount \"8372608.70\", which matches our calculation. This confirms that the difference between revenue and cost is indeed \"8372608.70\".\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of the difference between revenue and cost is \"8372608.70\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8372608.70'} }\n```",
