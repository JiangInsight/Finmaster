In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit\".\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\nFrom the given problem, we can locate these two line items and their corresponding amounts:\n\n- **Net Profit**: The value is `3744117.89` under the \"Net Profit\" line item.\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The value is `2479994.53` under the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3744117.89', 'value2': '2479994.53'} }\n```",
