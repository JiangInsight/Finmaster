This is typically reflected in the \"Accounts Receivable\" line in the cash flow statement under the \"Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity for credit sales or services.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is the relevant one. \n   - An increase in accounts receivable (negative value) means less cash was collected from credit sales.\n   - A decrease in accounts receivable (positive value) means more cash was collected from credit sales.\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is \"-14921566.06\". This negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable, meaning there was a decrease in cash collected from credit sales (i.e., amounts owed to the entity increased).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value to be extracted is \"-14921566.06\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-14921566.06'} }\n```",
