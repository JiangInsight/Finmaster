COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of materials and labor.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is clearly listed with an amount of \"20200000.00\" for the date \"2024-02-05.\"\n\n3. **Verify the Line Item**: Ensure that \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is indeed the correct line item for the carrying amount of inventories sold. This is standard accounting practice, as COGS includes the cost of inventory sold during the period.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"20200000.00.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20200000.00'} }\n```",
