                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line items and values of expense in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the given balance sheet. \n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are to look for expense items in the balance sheet that would typically affect the profit or loss statement. Common expense-related items in the balance sheet include:\n   - Accumulated Depreciation (a contra-asset account representing depreciation expense over time).\n   - Taxes Payable (related to tax expense).\n   - Other expenses might be implied by changes in retained earnings, but these are not directly listed as line items in the given balance sheet.\n\n2. **Analyze the Given Balance Sheet**:\n   - The balance sheet includes \"Accumulated Depreciation\" and \"Taxes Payable,\" which are directly related to expenses (depreciation expense and tax expense, respectively).\n   - \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is explicitly listed with an initial value of `0.00` and an end value of `120970.16`.\n   - \"Taxes Payable\" is also listed with an initial value of `0.00` and an end value of `1428630.43`. However, taxes payable is a liability and not an expense line item in the balance sheet itself (though it relates to tax expense in the income statement).\n\n3. **Focus on Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Accumulated Depreciation is the most direct expense-related item in the balance sheet. It represents the total depreciation expense accumulated over time for fixed assets.\n   - The initial value is `0.00` (as of 2023-12-31), and the end value is `120970.16` (as of 2024-02-05). This indicates that depreciation expense for the period is `120970.16`.\n\n4. **Exclude Other Items**:\n   - Taxes Payable is a liability and not an expense line item in the balance sheet. The actual tax expense would be recorded in the income statement, but we are not given that here.\n   - Other items like \"Retained Earnings\" reflect net income (profit or loss) but do not directly give us an expense value.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The only explicit expense-related line item in the balance sheet is \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" with initial and end values as `0.00` and `120970.16`, respectively.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '120970.16'}}\n```",
