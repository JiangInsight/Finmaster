These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually one year). In the given balance sheet, the non-current assets are listed under \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" and their total is given as \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is provided under \"Total Non-current Assets\" for the initial date (2023-12-31), which is `8000000.00`.\n   - The end value of non-current assets is provided under \"Total Non-current Assets\" for the end date (2024-02-05), which is `10359024.37`.\n\n3. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value of \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `8000000.00`, which matches the initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" (`8000000.00`) since \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `0.00` at the initial date.\n   - The end value of \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `10359024.37`, which is calculated as the end value of \"Fixed Assets\" (`10479994.53`) minus the end value of \"Accumulated Depreciation\" (`120970.16`).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10359024.37'} }\n```",
