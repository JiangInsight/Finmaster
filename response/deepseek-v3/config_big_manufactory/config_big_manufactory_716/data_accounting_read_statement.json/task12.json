These are typically the current assets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all current assets.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Total Current Assets\" is given as `20000000.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Total Current Assets\" is given as `29413723.95` as of the end date `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify Non-Current Assets**: For completeness, we can note that \"Total Non-current Assets\" are not part of the operating cycle and thus not included in the solution.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe initial and end values of the total current assets are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '20000000.00', 'end value': '29413723.95'} }\n```",
