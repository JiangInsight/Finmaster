These are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually within one year). In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are:\n     - Accounts Payable\n     - Taxes Payable\n     - Total Current Liabilities\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" line item represents the sum of all liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle. \n   - From the table:\n     - **Initial value**: The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n     - **End value**: The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `8028630.43` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify**:\n   - The sum of the individual current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable) at the end date is `6600000.00 + 1428630.43 = 8028630.43`, which matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" value. This confirms the correctness of the extraction.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '8028630.43'}}\n```",
