These assets are typically categorized as \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents assets held for sale or in production is \"Inventory\". This is because inventory includes goods that are either ready for sale, in the process of being manufactured, or in production for sale.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Inventory\" is listed as \"0.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Inventory\" is listed as \"7400000.00\" on the end date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The example provided in the task also uses \"Inventory\" as the line item for assets held for sale, which confirms our selection.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '7400000.00'}}\n```",
