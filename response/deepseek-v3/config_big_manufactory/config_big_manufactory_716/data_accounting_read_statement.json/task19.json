                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the balance sheet provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their initial and end amounts. \n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract four specific line items from the balance sheet:\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically listed as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n2. **Accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is usually called \"Accumulated Depreciation\".\n3. **Tax payable**: This is listed as \"Taxes Payable\".\n4. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is often labeled as \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\nFor each of these, we need to note their initial amount and end amount from the balance sheet.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Balance Sheet\nLet's look at the balance sheet provided and pick out these four items.\n\n#### 1. Interest Receivable\n- **Account**: Interest Receivable\n- **Initial_amount**: 0.00\n- **End_amount**: 14887.89\n\n#### 2. Accumulated Depreciation\n- **Account**: Accumulated Depreciation\n- **Initial_amount**: 0.00\n- **End_amount**: 120970.16\n\n#### 3. Taxes Payable\n- **Account**: Taxes Payable\n- **Initial_amount**: 0.00\n- **End_amount**: 1428630.43\n\n#### 4. Paid-in Capital\n- **Account**: Paid-in Capital\n- **Initial_amount**: 28000000.00\n- **End_amount**: 28000000.00\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe problem mentions that for multiple outputs, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the balance sheet, the order is:\n1. Interest Receivable\n2. Accumulated Depreciation\n3. Taxes Payable\n4. Paid-in Capital\n\nThis matches the order in which we've listed them above.\n\n### Constructing the Solution\nNow, let's map these to the required JSON format. The keys are:\n- 'initial value1': Interest Receivable initial amount\n- 'end valu1': Interest Receivable end amount\n- 'initial value2': Accumulated Depreciation initial amount\n- 'end valu2': Accumulated Depreciation end amount\n- 'initial value3': Taxes Payable initial amount\n- 'end valu3': Taxes Payable end amount\n- 'initial value4': Paid-in Capital initial amount\n- 'end valu4': Paid-in Capital end amount\n\nFilling in the values:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"initial value1\": \"0.00\",\n    \"end valu1\": \"14887.89\",\n    \"initial value2\": \"0.00\",\n    \"end valu2\": \"120970.16\",\n    \"initial value3\": \"0.00\",\n    \"end valu3\": \"1428630.43\",\n    \"initial value4\": \"28000000.00\",\n    \"end valu4\": \"28000000.00\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '14887.89', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '120970.16', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '1428630.43', 'initial value4': '28000000.00', 'end valu4': '28000000.00'} }\n```",
