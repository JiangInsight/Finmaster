This information is typically found under \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: Look for the \"Retained Earnings\" row in the balance sheet. This line item represents the cumulative amount of profits or losses retained in the entity.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The \"Initial_amount\" column for \"Retained Earnings\" shows the value at the beginning of the period (initial value). In the given problem, this is `0.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The \"End_amount\" column for \"Retained Earnings\" shows the value at the end of the period (end value). In the given problem, this is `3744117.89` as of `2024-02-05`.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3744117.89'} }\n```",
