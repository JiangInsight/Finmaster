I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific pieces of information from the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This typically refers to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" because accounts payable represent amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n   \n2. **Acquisition of property, plant and equipment**: This is usually listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement.\n   \n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: This is the \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Cash Flow Statement\nLet's look at the given cash flow statement and locate these items.\n\n#### 1. Increase in Accounts Payable\nLooking under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities,\" we see:\n- Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 6,600,000.00\n\nThis is the amount by which accounts payable have increased during the period, indicating more goods or services were purchased on credit.\n\n#### 2. Purchase of Fixed Assets\nUnder \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" we find:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2,479,994.53\n\nThis represents the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment during the period.\n\n#### 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents at Beginning of Period\nUnder \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" we see:\n- Beginning Balance: 20,000,000.00\n\nThis is the cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n\n### Verifying the Values\nLet's double-check each to ensure accuracy:\n\n1. **Increase in Accounts Payable**: \n   - Line item: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\"\n   - Amount: 6,600,000.00\n   - This matches our understanding.\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**:\n   - Line item: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"\n   - Amount: 2,479,994.53\n   - Correct, as it's under investing activities.\n\n3. **Beginning Cash Balance**:\n   - Line item: \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\"\n   - Amount: 20,000,000.00\n   - This is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling these into the required JSON format, maintaining the order of the line items as they appear in the statement:\n\n1. Increase in Accounts Payable: '6600000.00'\n2. Purchase of Fixed Assets: '2479994.53'\n3. Beginning Cash Balance: '20000000.00'\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6600000.00', 'value2': '2479994.53', 'value3': '20000000.00'} }\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nBy carefully reading each section of the cash flow statement and identifying the relevant line items, we've successfully extracted the required values. Here's the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6600000.00', 'value2': '2479994.53', 'value3': '20000000.00'} }\n```",
