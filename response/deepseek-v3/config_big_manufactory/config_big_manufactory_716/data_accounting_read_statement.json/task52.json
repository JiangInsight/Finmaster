This is the amount that shareholders have invested in the company in exchange for shares.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and Final Values**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item shows:\n     - **Initial_amount**: 28000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - **End_amount**: 28000000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Verify No Changes**:\n   - The initial and end values for \"Paid-in Capital\" are the same, indicating that there were no additional contributions or withdrawals by shareholders during the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '28000000.00', 'end value': '28000000.00'}}\n```",
