In the given income statement, this is represented by \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is the cost associated with the goods sold, which is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\nFrom the provided income statement:\n- \"Main Business Revenue\" has an amount of \"28572608.70.\"\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" has an amount of \"20200000.00.\"\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28572608.70', 'value2': '20200000.00'} }\n```",
