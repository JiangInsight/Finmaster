                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's recap what we're looking for based on the task description:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This usually corresponds to the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\".\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is generally the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNow, let's map these to the provided cash flow statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Cash Flow Statement\n\nHere's the cash flow statement we're working with:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 3744117.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 120970.16 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -14921566.06 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -14887.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -7400000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 6600000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 1428630.43 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -10442735.47 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 2479994.53 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -2479994.53 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 20000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 7077270.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -12922730.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Identifying the Four Line Items\n\n1. **Depreciation**: \n   - Line item: \"Depreciation\"\n   - Value: 120970.16\n\n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**:\n   - Line item: \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\"\n   - Value: -7400000.00\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - Line item: \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"\n   - Value: -2479994.53\n\n4. **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents:\n   - Line item: \"Net Increase\"\n   - Value: -12922730.00\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure we're on the right track:\n\n- `value1` was \"Depreciation\": 45751.41\n- `value2` was \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": -5090000.00\n- `value3` was \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": -305354.43\n- `value4` was \"Net Increase\": -7565348.53\n\nThis matches our understanding, so we can proceed similarly.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling the values we've identified:\n\n- `value1`: Depreciation → 120970.16\n- `value2`: (Increase) Decrease in Inventory → -7400000.00\n- `value3`: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities → -2479994.53\n- `value4`: Net Increase → -12922730.00\n\nPutting this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '120970.16', 'value2': '-7400000.00', 'value3': '-2479994.53', 'value4': '-12922730.00'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Depreciation**: Found under \"Depreciation\" with value `120970.16`.\n2. **Inventory Change**: Found under \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with value `-7400000.00`.\n3. **Investing Activities**: Found under \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with value `-2479994.53`.\n4. **Net Cash Increase**: Found under \"Net Increase\" with value `-12922730.00`.\n\nAll values are correctly identified and matched to their respective line items as per the task description.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '120970.16', 'value2': '-7400000.00', 'value3': '-2479994.53', 'value4': '-12922730.00'} }\n```",
