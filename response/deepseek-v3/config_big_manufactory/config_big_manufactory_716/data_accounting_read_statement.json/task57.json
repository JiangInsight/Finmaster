This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Task**: The task asks for the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is represented by the \"Accounts Payable\" account in the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Locating Accounts Payable in the Balance Sheet**:\n   - In the balance sheet provided, the \"Accounts Payable\" account shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 6,600,000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n   - The increase in Accounts Payable is the difference between the end amount and the initial amount, which is 6,600,000.00 - 0.00 = 6,600,000.00.\n\n3. **Cross-Verification with Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" shows a value of 6,600,000.00. This confirms the increase in Accounts Payable during the period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 6,600,000.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6600000.00'}}\n```",
