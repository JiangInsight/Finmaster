                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract four specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these are the costs associated with marketing, selling, and distributing products or services.\n   \n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" in the income statement, which includes interest expenses on loans and other financing costs.\n   \n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is straightforward; it's \"Depreciation,\" which represents the allocation of the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives.\n   \n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is the \"Tax Expense,\" which shows the income tax owed for the period.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\nLet's look at the provided income statement and pick out these items:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 28572608.70 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 28572608.70 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 20200000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost | 20200000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit | 8372608.70 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 1544669.73 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Selling Expenses** | **1177105.26** | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Depreciation** | **120970.16** | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Financial Expenses** | **372003.12** | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses | 3214748.27 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income | 14887.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 5172748.32 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Tax Expense** | **1428630.43** | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit | 3744117.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\n1. **Selling Expenses**: This is clearly listed as \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of **1177105.26**.\n2. **Depreciation**: Listed as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of **120970.16**.\n3. **Financial Expenses**: Listed as \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of **372003.12**.\n4. **Tax Expense**: Listed as \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of **1428630.43**.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe example provided shows that the order of the values in the solution corresponds to the order in which these line items appear in the income statement. Looking at the table:\n\n- Selling Expenses appears first among the four.\n- Then Depreciation.\n- Followed by Financial Expenses.\n- Finally, Tax Expense is towards the end.\n\nSo, the order is maintained as per their appearance in the statement.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the above analysis, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1177105.26', 'value2': '120970.16', 'value3': '372003.12', 'value4': '1428630.43'} }\n```",
