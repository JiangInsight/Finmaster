I'm going to break it down to understand what each part is asking for and then extract the necessary information from the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the principal revenue-producing activities of the entity and other activities that are not investing or financing activities**: This is essentially the **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** from the Cash Flow Statement.\n   \n2. **Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid**: This refers to **Taxes Payable** from the Balance Sheet.\n   \n3. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This is the **Total Revenue** from the Income Statement.\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\n### Given Financial Statements\n\nWe have three financial statements provided:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**\n3. **Income Statement**\n\n### Extracting the Required Values\n\nLet's go through each one to find the required values.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet - Taxes Payable\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we find the line item \"Taxes Payable\":\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Taxes Payable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 1428630.43 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe \"End_amount\" is the current amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid: **1428630.43**\n\n#### 2. Income Statement - Total Revenue\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 28572608.70 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 28572608.70 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n\"Total Revenue\" is the total income from ordinary activities: **28572608.70**\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -10442735.47 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThis is the net cash from operating activities: **-10442735.47**\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe order in which we present these values should be as per the financial statement order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. \n\nWithin each statement, we're taking the first occurrence of the relevant line item, which aligns with the original order in the input.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1428630.43', 'value2': '28572608.70', 'value3': '-10442735.47'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**: Located \"Taxes Payable\" with an end amount of `1428630.43` → `value1`.\n2. **Income Statement**: Located \"Total Revenue\" as `28572608.70` → `value2`.\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**: Located \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" as `-10442735.47` → `value3`.\n4. Arranged in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1428630.43', 'value2': '28572608.70', 'value3': '-10442735.47'} }\n```",
