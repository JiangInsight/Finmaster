These items are typically categorized under \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The balance sheet includes a line item called \"Fixed Assets,\" which represents tangible assets used in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes.\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item is related to fixed assets but represents the depreciation over time, not the tangible value itself. Therefore, we exclude this from our extraction.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Fixed Assets\" line item has an initial value of `8000000.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is `10479994.53` as of `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify Non-Current Assets**:\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" includes \"Fixed Assets\" and other non-current assets. However, the task specifically asks for tangible items held for use, which aligns with \"Fixed Assets.\"\n\n4. **Exclude Other Items**:\n   - Items like \"Cash on Hand,\" \"Bank Deposits,\" \"Inventory,\" etc., are either current assets or not tangible assets held for production/supply/rental/administrative purposes.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe initial and end values of the relevant tangible assets (\"Fixed Assets\") are extracted as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10479994.53'} }\n```",
