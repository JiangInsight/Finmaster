This represents the tax liability at the end of the reporting period.\n\n3. **Check the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, there is a line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of `1428630.43`. This represents the change in tax payable during the reporting period.\n\n4. **Check the Income Statement**:\n   - In the income statement, there is a line item \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of `1428630.43`. This represents the tax expense incurred during the reporting period.\n\n5. **Consistency Across Statements**:\n   - All three sections (balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) report the same tax amount (`1428630.43`), which confirms the accuracy of the value.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period is `1428630.43`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1428630.43'}}\n```",
