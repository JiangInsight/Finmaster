In the given problem, \"Main Business Revenue\" is listed as 28,572,608.70.\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is usually represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement. In the given problem, \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed as 20,200,000.00.\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: This is typically represented by \"Administrative Expenses\" in the income statement. In the given problem, \"Administrative Expenses\" is listed as 1,544,669.73.\n\nNow, let's map these to the required values in the solution:\n\n- `value1`: \"Main Business Revenue\" → \"28572608.70\"\n- `value2`: \"Cost of Goods Sold\" → \"20200000.00\"\n- `value3`: \"Administrative Expenses\" → \"1544669.73\"\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28572608.70', 'value2': '20200000.00', 'value3': '1544669.73'}}\n```",
