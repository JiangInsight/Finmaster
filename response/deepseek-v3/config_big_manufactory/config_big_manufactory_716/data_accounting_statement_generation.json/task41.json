                        "content": "To calculate the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" for the cash flow statement, we need to identify all transactions where the payment method is \"Account Payable\" and the payment status is \"Unpaid\". These transactions represent purchases that have not yet been paid for, thus increasing the accounts payable balance.\n\nLet's analyze the given data step by step:\n\n1. First, we filter all purchase transactions where:\n   - `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\"\n   - `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\"\n\n2. From the problem data, we find the following relevant transactions:\n   - `Purchase20231231002`: Amount = 1,000,000.0\n   - `Purchase20231231008`: Amount = 1,000,000.0\n   - `Purchase20231231012`: Amount = 1,600,000.0\n   - `Purchase20231231018`: Amount = 3,000,000.0\n\n3. Summing these amounts gives the total increase in accounts payable:\n   1,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231002) +\n   1,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231008) +\n   1,600,000.0 (Purchase20231231012) +\n   3,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231018) = 6,600,000.0\n\n4. There are no transactions indicating a decrease in accounts payable (payments made against accounts payable) in the given data.\n\nTherefore, the net increase in accounts payable is 6,600,000.00.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '6600000.00'}}\n```",
