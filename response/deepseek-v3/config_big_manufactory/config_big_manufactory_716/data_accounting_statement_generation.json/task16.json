Paid-in capital typically represents the amount of money that shareholders have invested in the company through the purchase of stock. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Paid-in Capital**:\n   - The initial paid-in capital is usually recorded in the initial transactions under the \"Cash deposit\" and \"Bank deposit\" types. These represent the initial investments made into the company.\n   - From the given data, the initial transactions are:\n     - Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0\n     - Bank deposit: 15,000,000.0\n   - The sum of these amounts gives the initial paid-in capital:\n     - 5,000,000.0 (Cash deposit) + 15,000,000.0 (Bank deposit) = 20,000,000.0\n\n2. **Determine if There Are Any Changes to Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Paid-in capital typically does not change unless there are additional investments or withdrawals by shareholders. In the given transactions, there are no entries that indicate additional investments or withdrawals affecting the paid-in capital. All other transactions are related to purchases, expenses, sales, etc., which do not impact the paid-in capital.\n\n3. **Calculate the End Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Since there are no transactions that affect the paid-in capital after the initial deposits, the end value remains the same as the initial value.\n   - Therefore, the end paid-in capital is also 20,000,000.0.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '20000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '20000000.00'} }\n```",
