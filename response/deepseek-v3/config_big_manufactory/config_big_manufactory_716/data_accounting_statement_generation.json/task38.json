These transactions represent sales that have not yet been collected in cash, thus increasing accounts receivable.\n\nLet's go through the transactions step by step:\n\n1. **Sale20240103001**: Amount = 1,411,983.38 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n2. **Sale20240106004**: Amount = 1,180,660.04 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n3. **Sale20240107006**: Amount = 2,183,357.44 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n4. **Sale20240109007**: Amount = 1,081,640.66 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n5. **Sale20240121022**: Amount = 2,170,939.20 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n6. **Sale20240127028**: Amount = 1,384,684.30 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n7. **Sale20240130032**: Amount = 2,101,413.12 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n8. **Sale20240203036**: Amount = 1,974,918.04 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n9. **Sale20240204039**: Amount = 1,431,969.88 (Unpaid, Account Receivable)\n\nNow, sum all these amounts to get the total increase in accounts receivable:\n\n1,411,983.38 +\n1,180,660.04 +\n2,183,357.44 +\n1,081,640.66 +\n2,170,939.20 +\n1,384,684.30 +\n2,101,413.12 +\n1,974,918.04 +\n1,431,969.88 = \n**13,921,566.06**\n\nIn the cash flow statement, an increase in accounts receivable is shown as a negative number because it represents cash that has not been received yet. Therefore, the value to be reported is -13,921,566.06.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-13921566.06'}}\n```",
