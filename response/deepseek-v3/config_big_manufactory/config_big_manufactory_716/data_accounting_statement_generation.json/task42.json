This is because taxes on unpaid sales are not yet due and therefore do not affect the current tax payable.\n\nLet's go through the transactions step by step:\n\n1. Identify all sales transactions with \"Paid\" status:\n   - Sale20240103001: Tax amount = 70599.17\n   - Sale20240110009: Tax amount = 53221.91\n   - Sale20240113011: Tax amount = 109886.85\n   - Sale20240117016: Tax amount = 36009.58\n   - Sale20240118017: Tax amount = 55301.53\n   - Sale20240119019: Tax amount = 103420.37\n   - Sale20240120020: Tax amount = 36085.98\n   - Sale20240124024: Tax amount = 72772.67\n   - Sale20240128030: Tax amount = 109846.60\n   - Sale20240201034: Tax amount = 106006.64\n\n2. Sum all these tax amounts:\n   70599.17 + 53221.91 + 109886.85 + 36009.58 + 55301.53 + 103420.37 + 36085.98 + 72772.67 + 109846.60 + 106006.64 = 752,151.30\n\n3. The \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is the total tax amount that needs to be paid, which is 752,151.30.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '752151.30'} }\n```",
