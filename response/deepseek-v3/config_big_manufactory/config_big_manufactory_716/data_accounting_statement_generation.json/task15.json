Liabilities typically include accounts payable and any other unpaid obligations. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Liabilities:**\n   - The initial liabilities are the amounts that were unpaid at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31).\n   - From the transactions data, the only initial liability is from the purchase with `payment/receipt_status` as \"Unpaid\".\n   - The initial unpaid purchase is `Purchase20231231002` with an amount of `1,000,000.00`.\n\n2. **Identify Final Liabilities:**\n   - The final liabilities include all unpaid amounts at the end of the period.\n   - From the transactions data, the unpaid purchases are:\n     - `Purchase20231231002`: `1,000,000.00` (initial unpaid)\n     - `Purchase20231231008`: `1,000,000.00` (unpaid purchase)\n     - `Purchase20231231012`: `1,600,000.00` (unpaid purchase)\n     - `Purchase20231231018`: `3,000,000.00` (unpaid purchase)\n   - Sum of unpaid purchases: `1,000,000.00 + 1,000,000.00 + 1,600,000.00 + 3,000,000.00 = 6,600,000.00`.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Liabilities:**\n   - Initial Liabilities: `1,000,000.00`\n   - Final Liabilities: `6,600,000.00`\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '1000000.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '6600000.00'} }\n```",
