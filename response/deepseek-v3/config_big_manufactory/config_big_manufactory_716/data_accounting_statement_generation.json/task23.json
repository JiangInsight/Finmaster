                        "content": "To calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for the income statement, we need to sum up all the cost amounts associated with the sales transactions. The cost amount is the cost of the goods that were sold, which is typically recorded in the \"cost_amount\" column for each sale transaction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Sale Transactions**: Look for all transactions where the \"type\" is \"Sale\". These are the transactions where goods were sold to customers.\n\n2. **Extract Cost Amounts**: For each sale transaction, extract the \"cost_amount\" value. This represents the cost of the goods sold in that transaction.\n\n3. **Sum the Cost Amounts**: Add up all the \"cost_amount\" values from the sale transactions to get the total Cost of Goods Sold.\n\n### Calculation:\n\nFrom the provided data, the sale transactions and their corresponding cost amounts are:\n\n1. Sale20240103001: cost_amount = 1000000.0\n2. Sale20240106004: cost_amount = 800000.0\n3. Sale20240107006: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n4. Sale20240109007: cost_amount = 800000.0\n5. Sale20240110009: cost_amount = 800000.0\n6. Sale20240113011: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n7. Sale20240117016: cost_amount = 500000.0\n8. Sale20240118017: cost_amount = 800000.0\n9. Sale20240119019: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n10. Sale20240120020: cost_amount = 500000.0\n11. Sale20240121022: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n12. Sale20240124024: cost_amount = 1000000.0\n13. Sale20240127028: cost_amount = 1000000.0\n14. Sale20240128030: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n15. Sale20240130032: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n16. Sale20240201034: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n17. Sale20240203036: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n18. Sale20240204039: cost_amount = 1000000.0\n\nNow, sum all these cost amounts:\n\n1000000.0 + 800000.0 + 1500000.0 + 800000.0 + 800000.0 + 1500000.0 + 500000.0 + 800000.0 + 1500000.0 + 500000.0 + 1500000.0 + 1000000.0 + 1000000.0 + 1500000.0 + 1500000.0 + 1500000.0 + 1500000.0 + 1000000.0 = 18,000,000.0\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '18000000.00'}}\n```",
