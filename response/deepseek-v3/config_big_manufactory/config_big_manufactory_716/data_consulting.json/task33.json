                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how I arrive at the numbers. \n\n### Understanding the Data\nFirst, let's summarize the key figures we'll need from the provided financial statements:\n\n**Balance Sheet (End of Period - 2024-02-05):**\n- **Current Assets:**\n  - Cash on Hand: 6,057,264.53\n  - Bank Deposits: 1,020,005.47\n  - Interest Receivable: 14,887.89\n  - Accounts Receivable: 14,921,566.06\n  - Inventory: 7,400,000.00\n  - **Total Current Assets:** 29,413,723.95\n- **Current Liabilities:**\n  - Accounts Payable: 6,600,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 1,428,630.43\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 8,028,630.43\n- **Total Liabilities:** Same as Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are mentioned)\n- **Owner's Equity:**\n  - Paid-in Capital: 28,000,000.00\n  - Retained Earnings: 3,744,117.89\n  - **Total Owner's Equity:** 31,744,117.89\n- **Total Assets:** 39,772,748.32\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -10,442,735.47\n- **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** -2,479,994.53\n- **Net Increase in Cash:** -12,922,730.00\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- **Main Business Revenue (Sales):** 28,572,608.70\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** 20,200,000.00\n- **Net Profit:** 3,744,117.89\n\nNow, let's calculate each ratio.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\n**Calculation:**  \nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10,442,735.47  \nCurrent Liabilities = 8,028,630.43  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ -1.30\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\nHere, Total Debt is the same as Total Current Liabilities since there's no long-term debt mentioned.  \nTotal Debt = 8,028,630.43  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ -1.30\n\n*Note: This seems to be the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio in this case because total debt equals current liabilities. Sometimes, debt refers to total liabilities, but here it's the same.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2  \nFrom the balance sheet, Beginning Inventory is 0.00 (initial amount), Ending Inventory is 7,400,000.00  \nAverage Inventory = (0 + 7,400,000) / 2 = 3,700,000  \nCOGS = 20,200,000.00  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = 20,200,000 / 3,700,000 ≈ 5.46\n\n*Wait a minute, in the example provided, the Inventory Turnover was calculated differently. Let me check the example:*\n\nIn the example:\nCOGS = 4,410,000  \nInventory at end = 5,090,000  \nBeginning inventory was 0  \nAverage inventory = (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000  \nInventory Turnover = 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct based on the formula. Maybe the example had a different approach, but standard formula is COGS / Average Inventory.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nTotal Liabilities = 8,028,630.43  \nTotal Equity = 31,744,117.89  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89 ≈ 0.25\n\n*In the example, it was 0.16, which was Total Current Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity. Maybe they considered only current liabilities as debt. If we do the same here:*\n\nTotal Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43  \nTotal Owner's Equity = 31,744,117.89  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89 ≈ 0.25\n\nSame result. Maybe the example had different numbers.\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nCurrent Assets = 29,413,723.95  \nInventory = 7,400,000.00  \nCurrent Liabilities = 8,028,630.43  \nQuick Ratio = (29,413,723.95 - 7,400,000) / 8,028,630.43  \n= 22,013,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 2.74\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nCurrent Assets = 29,413,723.95  \nCurrent Liabilities = 8,028,630.43  \nCurrent Ratio = 29,413,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 3.66\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the example provided:\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: Same as above (since total debt is current liabilities)\n- Inventory Turnover: 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n- Debt to Equity: 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16\n- Quick Ratio: (7,956,806.47 - 5,090,000) / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n- Current Ratio: 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.27\n\nMy calculations seem to follow the same method, so I think they're correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the above calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.30', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.30', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '5.46', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.25', 'Quick Ratio': '2.74', 'Current Ratio': '3.66'}}\n```\n\n*However, the Inventory Turnover seems high compared to the example. Maybe the example had a typo or different interpretation. But based on standard formulas, this is correct.*\n\n**Alternative Interpretation for Inventory Turnover:**\nSometimes, Inventory Turnover is calculated as Sales / Average Inventory instead of COGS / Average Inventory.\n\nIf we use Sales:\nInventory Turnover = 28,572,608.70 / 3,700,000 ≈ 7.72\n\nBut the example used COGS, so I'll stick with COGS.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.30', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.30', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '5.46', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.25', 'Quick Ratio': '2.74', 'Current Ratio': '3.66'}}\n```",
