                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the required ratios and metrics based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 29,413,723.95\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 8,028,630.43\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 29,413,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 3.66\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Formula:** Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 8,372,608.70\n- Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (8,372,608.70 / 28,572,608.70) * 100 ≈ 29.30%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities: We only have Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43 (assuming no long-term liabilities since they're not listed)\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 39,772,748.32\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 8,028,630.43 / 39,772,748.32 ≈ 0.20\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 3,744,117.89\n- Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (3,744,117.89 / 28,572,608.70) * 100 ≈ 13.10%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash to Current Debt Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 6,057,264.53\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 1,020,005.47\n- Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n\nCash + Cash Equivalents = 6,057,264.53 + 1,020,005.47 = 7,077,270.00\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 7,077,270.00 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 0.88\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n**Formula:** FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10,442,735.47\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -2,479,994.53\n\nCalculation:\nFCF = -10,442,735.47 + (-2,479,994.53) = -12,922,730.00\n\n(Note: This matches the \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents at the bottom of the cash flow statement, which is -12,922,730.00)\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Profit = 3,744,117.89\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 39,772,748.32\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (3,744,117.89 / 39,772,748.32) * 100 ≈ 9.41%\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling all these calculations into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.66', 'Gross Profit Margin': '29.30%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.20', 'Net Profit Margin': '13.10%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '0.88', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-12922730.00', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '9.41%'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Current Ratio:** 29,413,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 3.66 ✔\n2. **Gross Profit Margin:** 8,372,608.70 / 28,572,608.70 ≈ 0.293 → 29.3% ✔\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio:** 8,028,630.43 / 39,772,748.32 ≈ 0.20 ✔ (Assuming no long-term debt)\n4. **Net Profit Margin:** 3,744,117.89 / 28,572,608.70 ≈ 0.131 → 13.1% ✔\n5. **Cash to Current Debt Ratio:** 7,077,270 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 0.88 ✔\n6. **FCF:** -10,442,735.47 + (-2,479,994.53) = -12,922,730 ✔\n7. **ROA:** 3,744,117.89 / 39,772,748.32 ≈ 0.0941 → 9.41% ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The calculations seem correct based on the provided financial data.",
