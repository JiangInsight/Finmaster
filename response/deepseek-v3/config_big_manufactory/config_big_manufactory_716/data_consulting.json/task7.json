                        "content": "To calculate the Free Cash Flow (FCF), we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Components of FCF**: \n   - Free Cash Flow is typically calculated as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities minus Capital Expenditures (which is part of Cash Flow from Investing Activities).\n   - Alternatively, FCF can also be derived from the net increase in cash and cash equivalents, as it represents the overall change in cash position after accounting for all operating, investing, and financing activities. However, in the given problem, financing activities are not provided, so we will use the first method.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Data**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -10,442,735.47\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -2,479,994.53 (which includes the Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\n3. **Calculate FCF**:\n   - FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n   - FCF = -10,442,735.47 + (-2,479,994.53) = -12,922,730.00\n\n4. **Verify with Net Increase in Cash**:\n   - The net increase in cash and cash equivalents is -12,922,730.00, which matches our FCF calculation. This confirms our result.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The Free Cash Flow (FCF) is -12,922,730.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-12922730.00'} }\n```",
