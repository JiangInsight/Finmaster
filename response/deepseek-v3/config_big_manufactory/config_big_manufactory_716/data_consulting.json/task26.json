                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. I'll go through each one, explaining how to calculate them based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n**Definition:** ROE measures a company's profitability by showing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 3,744,117.89\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Owner's Equity = 31,744,117.89\n\nCalculating ROE:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{3,744,117.89}{31,744,117.89} \\times 100 \\approx 11.79\\% \\]\n\n### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n- Total Assets = 39,772,748.32\n\nCalculating Debt to Asset Ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{8,028,630.43}{39,772,748.32} \\approx 0.20 \\]\n\n### 3. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 8,372,608.70\n- Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70\n\nCalculating Gross Profit Margin:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{8,372,608.70}{28,572,608.70} \\times 100 \\approx 29.30\\% \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all these calculations into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '11.79%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.20', 'Gross Profit Margin': '29.30%'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **ROE:**\n   - 3,744,117.89 / 31,744,117.89 ≈ 0.1179 → 11.79% ✔\n\n2. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - 8,028,630.43 / 39,772,748.32 ≈ 0.2019 → 0.20 (rounded to two decimal places) ✔\n\n3. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - 8,372,608.70 / 28,572,608.70 ≈ 0.2930 → 29.30% ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **ROE:** A positive ROE indicates that the company is generating profit from shareholders' equity. Here, it's about 11.79%, which seems decent, but context is needed (industry average, historical performance, etc.).\n  \n- **Debt to Asset Ratio:** 0.20 means that 20% of the company's assets are financed by debt, and the remaining 80% by equity. This suggests a relatively low level of debt, which is generally good as it indicates less financial risk.\n  \n- **Gross Profit Margin:** 29.30% means that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about $0.29 after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a healthy margin, but again, industry comparison would provide better context.\n\nThis analysis provides a snapshot of the company's financial health based on these three metrics.",
