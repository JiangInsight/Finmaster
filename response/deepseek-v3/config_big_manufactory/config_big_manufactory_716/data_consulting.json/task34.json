                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each calculation step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10,442,735.47\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n\nCalculation:\n= -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ -1.30\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43 (assuming this is the only debt, as no long-term liabilities are listed)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 31,744,117.89\n\nCalculation:\n= 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89 ≈ 0.25\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets  \n(Assuming Average Total Assets ≈ End_amount since Initial_amount is at the start)\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 28,572,608.70\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 39,772,748.32\n\nCalculation:\n= 28,572,608.70 / 39,772,748.32 ≈ 0.72\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 29,413,723.95\n- Inventory = 7,400,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n\nCalculation:\n= (29,413,723.95 - 7,400,000.00) / 8,028,630.43  \n= 22,013,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 2.74\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n(This is similar to the first ratio; sometimes they are the same)\n\nFrom earlier:\n= -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ -1.30\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 3,744,117.89\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Owner's Equity = 31,744,117.89\n\nCalculation:\n= 3,744,117.89 / 31,744,117.89 ≈ 0.118 or 11.8%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable  \n(Assuming all sales are credit sales and Average AR ≈ End_amount since Initial_amount is 0)\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 28,572,608.70\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 14,921,566.06\n\nCalculation:\n= 28,572,608.70 / 14,921,566.06 ≈ 1.91\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.30', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.25', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.72', 'Quick Ratio': '2.74', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.30', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '11.80%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '1.91'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify a couple of these to ensure no mistakes.\n\n- **Quick Ratio:** (29,413,723.95 - 7,400,000) = 22,013,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 2.74 ✔\n- **ROE:** 3,744,117.89 / 31,744,117.89 ≈ 0.118 → 11.8% ✔\n- **AR Turnover:** 28,572,608.70 / 14,921,566.06 ≈ 1.91 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The negative operating cash flow ratios indicate that the company's operating activities are consuming cash relative to its current liabilities, which might be a concern. The high quick ratio suggests good liquidity, and the ROE is positive, indicating profitability from the shareholders' perspective. The accounts receivable turnover suggests that the company collects its receivables about 1.91 times a year, which is roughly every 191 days (365/1.91), indicating a longer collection period.",
