                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each of the three required ratios: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio. \n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. \n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities: 8,028,630.43\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n- Total Owner's Equity: 31,744,117.89\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{8,028,630.43}{31,744,117.89} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{8,028,630.43}{31,744,117.89} \\approx 0.2529 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx 0.25 \\]\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It indicates the profitability of the company.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Net Profit: 3,744,117.89\n- Total Revenue: 28,572,608.70\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{3,744,117.89}{28,572,608.70} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\\[ \\frac{3,744,117.89}{28,572,608.70} \\approx 0.1310 \\]\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n\\[ 0.1310 \\times 100\\% \\approx 13.10\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -10,442,735.47\n- From the Balance Sheet, Total Current Liabilities: 8,028,630.43\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43} \\]\n\nDivide:\n\\[ \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43} \\approx -1.3007 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx -1.30 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.25', 'Net Profit Margin': '13.10%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.30'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 8,028,630.43\n   - Equity: 31,744,117.89\n   - 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89 ≈ 0.25 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: 3,744,117.89\n   - Revenue: 28,572,608.70\n   - 3,744,117.89 / 28,572,608.70 ≈ 0.131 → 13.10% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -10,442,735.47\n   - Current Liabilities: 8,028,630.43\n   - -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ -1.30 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! \n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Debt to Equity Ratio (0.25):** This indicates that the company has $0.25 in debt for every $1 of equity. This is a relatively low ratio, suggesting the company is not heavily leveraged and relies more on equity financing.\n  \n- **Net Profit Margin (13.10%):** This means that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains $0.131 as profit. A positive margin indicates profitability, though the actual health depends on industry standards.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities (-1.30):** A negative ratio is concerning as it suggests that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover current liabilities. This could indicate liquidity issues unless temporary.\n\nThese ratios together provide insights into the company's financial health regarding leverage, profitability, and liquidity.",
