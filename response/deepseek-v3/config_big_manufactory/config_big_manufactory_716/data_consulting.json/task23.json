                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. We need to calculate two ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**  \nGross Profit Margin is a profitability ratio that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement provided:\n- **Total Revenue (Main Business Revenue):** 28,572,608.70\n- **Gross Profit:** 8,372,608.70\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{8,372,608.70}{28,572,608.70} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{8,372,608.70}{28,572,608.70} \\approx 0.293 \\]\n\\[ 0.293 \\times 100 \\approx 29.3\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **29.30%**.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to identify:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** From the cash flow statement, it's -10,442,735.47 (negative value).\n- **Total Debt:** This is typically the sum of all liabilities. From the balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" we have 8,028,630.43. There doesn't seem to be any long-term debt listed, so we'll assume total debt is just the current liabilities for this calculation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43} \\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\\[ \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43} \\approx -1.30 \\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-1.30**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining both calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '29.30%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.30'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin:**\n- Gross Profit: 8,372,608.70\n- Total Revenue: 28,572,608.70\n- 8,372,608.70 / 28,572,608.70 ≈ 0.293 → 29.3% ✔\n\n**Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating: -10,442,735.47\n- Total Debt (Current Liabilities): 8,028,630.43\n- -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ -1.30 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! \n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Negative Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:** A negative value indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, meaning it's not generating enough cash from operations to cover its debt, which could be a concern.\n- **Gross Profit Margin:** A 29.3% margin suggests that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about $0.29 after accounting for the cost of goods sold, which is a healthy margin.\n\nThis analysis provides a snapshot of the company's profitability and its ability to service debt based on the provided financial statements.",
