                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio to understand how to compute them based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 8,028,630.43\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities:** Not provided explicitly, but looking at the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities.\" There's no separate line for long-term debt or non-current liabilities. So, we'll assume that Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43.\n  \n  *Wait a minute, looking back at the balance sheet, under \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity,\" it sums up to 39,772,748.32, which matches \"Total Assets.\" The components are \"Total Current Liabilities\" and \"Total Owner's Equity.\" So indeed, there are no non-current liabilities listed. Therefore, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43.*\n\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 39,772,748.32\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{8,028,630.43}{39,772,748.32} \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{8,028,630.43}{39,772,748.32} \\approx 0.2019 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.20\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.14', which is a single decimal. Maybe we're supposed to round to one decimal place here. So, 0.2.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other interpretation. Maybe \"Total Liabilities\" includes something else. The balance sheet seems to only have current liabilities, so 0.20 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Debt\" is considered only interest-bearing liabilities, but here all current liabilities seem to be accounts payable and taxes payable, which are typically considered debt. So, sticking with 0.20.\n\nWait, in the example, the debt was just current liabilities over total assets, giving 0.14. Here, it's similar, so maybe it's correct to have it higher here.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the operating cash flow to the net income, showing how much cash is generated from operations relative to reported earnings. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit (Net Income)}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -10,442,735.47\n- **Net Profit (from Income Statement):** 3,744,117.89\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{3,744,117.89} \\approx -2.788 \\]\n\nThis gives a negative ratio, which might indicate that the company is generating negative cash flow from operations despite having positive net income, possibly due to significant increases in working capital (like accounts receivable and inventory).\n\nBut in the example, the ratio was positive (4.41) even though net income was negative, and operating cash flow was more negative. Here, net income is positive, and operating cash flow is negative, leading to a negative ratio.\n\nPerhaps the absolute value is considered, but that doesn't make sense in interpretation. Maybe the formula is inverted, but typically it's operating cash flow over net income.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the signs are considered differently. In the example:\n\nNet Profit: -1,645,141.43\nOperating Cash Flow: -7,259,994.10\nRatio: 4.41\n\nSo, -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nHere, -10,442,735.47 / 3,744,117.89 ≈ -2.79\n\nSo, the ratio can be negative when signs differ. Maybe the answer is -2.8.\n\nBut the example had both negative, leading to positive ratio. Here, one is positive, one is negative, so negative ratio.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter calculating:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.20\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: -2.79\n\nBut the example had ratios as strings with two decimal places, so maybe we should present similarly.\n\nRounding to two decimals:\n\nDebt to Asset: 0.20\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income: -2.79\n\nBut the example had one decimal for Debt (0.14) and two for the other (4.41). Maybe follow that.\n\nDebt to Asset: 0.2\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income: -2.79\n\nBut the example had both as strings with two decimals, so maybe:\n\nDebt to Asset: '0.20'\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income: '-2.79'\n\nBut the example had '0.14' and '4.41', so one decimal and two decimals. Maybe it's based on the numbers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps:\n\nDebt to Asset: '0.2'\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income: '-2.79'\n\nBut to match the example's format where both were two decimals, maybe:\n\nDebt to Asset: '0.20'\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income: '-2.79'\n\nBut the example had '0.14' (one decimal) and '4.41' (two decimals). Maybe it's based on the calculation.\n\nGiven that, I'll present as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.20', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-2.79'} }\n```\n\nBut the example had '0.14' which is one decimal for Debt to Asset, so maybe '0.2' is better here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Debt to Asset is supposed to be without the trailing zero, so '0.2'.\n\nGiven that, and Operating Cash Flow to Net Income is '-2.79', final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.2', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-2.79'} }\n```\n\nBut looking back, the example had '0.14' which is two decimals, so maybe '0.20' is correct here.\n\nGiven that, and operating cash flow to net income is '-2.79', final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.20', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-2.79'} }\n```",
