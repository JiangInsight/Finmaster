                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 29,413,723.95\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 8,028,630.43\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 29,413,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 3.66\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 6,057,264.53\n- Bank Deposits = 1,020,005.47\n- Interest Receivable = 14,887.89\n- Accounts Receivable = 14,921,566.06\n- Total Quick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n  = 6,057,264.53 + 1,020,005.47 + 14,887.89 + 14,921,566.06 ≈ 22,013,723.95\n- Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 22,013,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 2.74\n\n*Note:* Sometimes, Interest Receivable might not be included in quick assets, but since it's a short-term receivable, I included it. If excluded, Quick Assets would be ~22,013,723.95 - 14,887.89 ≈ 21,998,836.06, Quick Ratio ≈ 2.74 (almost same here).\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 8,028,630.43\n- Total Assets = 39,772,748.32\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 8,028,630.43 / 39,772,748.32 ≈ 0.20\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n- Total Owner's Equity = 31,744,117.89\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89 ≈ 0.25\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10,442,735.47\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ -1.30\n\n*Note:* A negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, which isn't favorable for covering debt.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.66', 'Quick Ratio': '2.74', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.20', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.25', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.30'}}\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Current Ratio:** 29,413,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 = 3.663 (≈3.66) ✅\n2. **Quick Ratio:** (6,057,264.53 + 1,020,005.47 + 14,887.89 + 14,921,566.06) / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 22,013,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 2.74 ✅\n3. **Debt to Asset:** 8,028,630.43 / 39,772,748.32 ≈ 0.20 ✅\n4. **Debt to Equity:** 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89 ≈ 0.25 ✅\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt:** -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ -1.30 ✅\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided financial data.",
