                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two things: the Free Cash Flow (FCF) and the Current Assets Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** This is the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. It's an important measure because it shows how efficient a company is at generating cash. The formula is:\n   - FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n   - Alternatively, sometimes it's calculated as Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures, but in the given data, we have the net cash flows directly.\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. The formula is:\n   - Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n   - Average Current Assets = (Initial Current Assets + End Current Assets) / 2\n\n### Calculating Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -10,442,735.47\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -2,479,994.53\n\nSo,\nFCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\nFCF = -10,442,735.47 + (-2,479,994.53) = -12,922,730.00\n\nWait a minute, looking at the cash flow statement, there's a line \"Net Increase\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" which is -12,922,730.00. This seems to match the sum of the operating and investing cash flows. So, FCF is indeed -12,922,730.00.\n\nBut in the example provided, FCF was taken as the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents. So, to be consistent with the example, FCF is the net increase in cash and cash equivalents, which is -12,922,730.00.\n\n### Calculating Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue: 28,572,608.70\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Current Assets (2023-12-31): 20,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets (2024-02-05): 29,413,723.95\n\nAverage Current Assets = (Initial + End) / 2\n= (20,000,000.00 + 29,413,723.95) / 2\n= 49,413,723.95 / 2\n= 24,706,861.975\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio = Total Revenue / Average Current Assets\n= 28,572,608.70 / 24,706,861.975\n≈ 1.156\n\nWait, let's compute it more precisely:\n28,572,608.70 / 24,706,861.975 ≈ 1.156\n\nBut in the example, the ratio was less than 1. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck the formula.\n\nIs it Total Revenue / End Current Assets? Sometimes it's calculated using only the ending balance. Let me see the example:\n\nIn the example:\nTotal Revenue: 5,431,018.59\nInitial Current Assets: 8,000,000.00\nEnd Current Assets: 7,956,806.47\nAverage = (8,000,000 + 7,956,806.47)/2 ≈ 7,978,403.235\nRatio = 5,431,018.59 / 7,978,403.235 ≈ 0.68\n\nSo, the example uses average current assets. So, my calculation seems correct, but the ratio is higher in this case.\n\nWait, maybe I made a calculation error in average.\n\nAverage Current Assets = (20,000,000 + 29,413,723.95)/2 = 49,413,723.95 / 2 = 24,706,861.975\n\nThen, 28,572,608.70 / 24,706,861.975 ≈ 1.156\n\nYes, that's correct. Maybe the business is more efficient in this case.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-12922730.00', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '1.16'}}\n```\n\nWait, let's format the numbers correctly without commas for the JSON.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-12922730.00', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '1.16'}}\n```\n\nBut the example had the ratio with two decimal places, so maybe we should keep two decimal places here as well.\n\nCalculating more precisely:\n28,572,608.70 / 24,706,861.975 ≈ 1.1564, so rounding to two decimal places is 1.16.\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me verify FCF:\nFrom cash flow:\nNet Cash from Operating: -10,442,735.47\nNet Cash from Investing: -2,479,994.53\nTotal: -12,922,730.00\nMatches \"Net Increase\" in cash: -12,922,730.00 ✔\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover:\nRevenue: 28,572,608.70\nAvg Current Assets: (20,000,000 + 29,413,723.95)/2 = 24,706,861.975\nRatio: 28,572,608.70 / 24,706,861.975 ≈ 1.156 → 1.16 ✔\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Free Cash Flow (FCF)\": \"-12922730.00\", \"Current Assets Turnover Ratio\": \"1.16\"}}\n```",
