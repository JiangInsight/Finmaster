                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the **Current Assets Turnover Ratio** based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nFirst, what is the Current Assets Turnover Ratio? From what I understand, it measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales or Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Net Sales or Revenue** is the total revenue from the income statement.\n- **Average Current Assets** is the average of the beginning and ending current assets from the balance sheet.\n\n### Identifying the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the given problem, let's extract the required data:\n\n1. **Net Sales or Revenue**: \n   - From the income statement, \"Total Revenue\" is **28,572,608.70**.\n\n2. **Current Assets**:\n   - From the balance sheet:\n     - Initial (beginning) Total Current Assets: **20,000,000.00** (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End Total Current Assets: **29,413,723.95** (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n### Calculating Average Current Assets\n\nAverage Current Assets is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{20,000,000.00 + 29,413,723.95}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{49,413,723.95}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = 24,706,861.975 \\]\n\n### Calculating the Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nNow, plug the values into the turnover ratio formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{28,572,608.70}{24,706,861.975} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{28,572,608.70}{24,706,861.975} \\approx 1.156 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately **1.16**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n- Revenue: 28,572,608.70\n- Beginning Current Assets: 20,000,000.00\n- Ending Current Assets: 29,413,723.95\n- Average: (20,000,000 + 29,413,723.95) / 2 = 49,413,723.95 / 2 = 24,706,861.975\n- Ratio: 28,572,608.70 / 24,706,861.975 ≈ 1.156\n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\n### Considering the Example Provided\n\nLooking back at the example given in the task:\n\n- Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Beginning Current Assets: 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Current Assets: 7,956,806.47\n- Average: (8,000,000 + 7,956,806.47) / 2 ≈ 7,978,403.235\n- Ratio: 5,431,018.59 / 7,978,403.235 ≈ 0.68\n\nThis matches the provided solution of 0.68, so my approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Calculation for the Given Problem\n\nApplying the same method to the current problem:\n\n- Revenue: 28,572,608.70\n- Average Current Assets: 24,706,861.975\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 28,572,608.70 / 24,706,861.975 ≈ 1.156\n\nRounding to two decimal places: **1.16**\n\n### Potential Considerations\n\nIs there anything else to consider? \n\n- Sometimes, \"Net Sales\" might be used instead of \"Total Revenue,\" but in this case, the income statement shows \"Total Revenue\" as the top-line figure, which is appropriate to use.\n- The time period is from December 31, 2023, to February 5, 2024, which is a little over a month. The ratio is typically annualized, but since the revenue and assets are for the same period, it's acceptable as is.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully going through the calculations, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio is approximately **1.16**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '1.16'}}\n```",
