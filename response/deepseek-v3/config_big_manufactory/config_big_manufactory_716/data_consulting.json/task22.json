                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis problem step by step. We need to calculate two key financial ratios: the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin, based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Quick Ratio (also known as the Acid-Test Ratio):**\n   - This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n   - Formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - **Quick Assets** typically include:\n     - Cash and cash equivalents\n     - Marketable securities\n     - Accounts receivable\n     - (Note: Inventory is excluded because it's not as liquid)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n     \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (end amounts as of 2024-02-05):\n\n- **Quick Assets:**\n  - Cash on Hand: 6,057,264.53\n  - Bank Deposits: 1,020,005.47\n  - Interest Receivable: 14,887.89\n  - Accounts Receivable: 14,921,566.06\n  - (Inventory: 7,400,000.00) → Excluded from quick assets\n\n- **Current Liabilities:**\n  - Accounts Payable: 6,600,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 1,428,630.43\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 8,028,630.43\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- Total Revenue: 28,572,608.70\n- Net Profit: 3,744,117.89\n\n### Calculating the Quick Ratio\n\nFirst, sum up the quick assets:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Interest Receivable} + \\text{Accounts Receivable}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 6,057,264.53 + 1,020,005.47 + 14,887.89 + 14,921,566.06\n\\]\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n1. Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits:\n   \\[\n   6,057,264.53 + 1,020,005.47 = 7,077,270.00\n   \\]\n2. Add Interest Receivable:\n   \\[\n   7,077,270.00 + 14,887.89 = 7,092,157.89\n   \\]\n3. Add Accounts Receivable:\n   \\[\n   7,092,157.89 + 14,921,566.06 = 22,013,723.95\n   \\]\n\nNow, calculate the Quick Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{22,013,723.95}{8,028,630.43}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{22,013,723.95}{8,028,630.43} \\approx 2.741\n\\]\n\nSo, the Quick Ratio is approximately **2.74**.\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{3,744,117.89}{28,572,608.70} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nFirst, divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3,744,117.89}{28,572,608.70} \\approx 0.131\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.131 \\times 100\\% \\approx 13.1\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately **13.1%**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the quick assets to ensure I didn't miss anything:\n\n- Cash on Hand: 6,057,264.53\n- Bank Deposits: 1,020,005.47\n- Interest Receivable: 14,887.89\n- Accounts Receivable: 14,921,566.06\n- Total: 6,057,264.53 + 1,020,005.47 = 7,077,270.00\n  + 14,887.89 = 7,092,157.89\n  + 14,921,566.06 = 22,013,723.95\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 8,028,630.43\n\nQuick Ratio: 22,013,723.95 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ 2.74\n\nNet Profit: 3,744,117.89\nRevenue: 28,572,608.70\nNet Profit Margin: (3,744,117.89 / 28,572,608.70) * 100 ≈ 13.1%\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Quick Ratio\": \"2.74\", \"Net Profit Margin\": \"13.10%\"}}\n```\n\n*Note: The Net Profit Margin is rounded to two decimal places for clarity.*",
