                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 8,028,630.43\n- **Total Owner's Equity (End_amount):** 31,744,117.89\n- **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity (End_amount):** 39,772,748.32\n\nWait, actually, \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" is equal to \"Total Assets\". So, Total Assets = 39,772,748.32.\n\nNow, Total Liabilities would be Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity minus Owner's Equity:\n\\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity} - \\text{Total Owner's Equity} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = 39,772,748.32 - 31,744,117.89 = 8,028,630.43 \\]\n\nThis matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" given, which implies there are no long-term liabilities in this case.\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{8,028,630.43}{39,772,748.32} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{8,028,630.43}{39,772,748.32} \\approx 0.2018 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.20\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 8,372,608.70\n- **Total Revenue:** 28,572,608.70\n\nCalculate:\n\\[ \\frac{8,372,608.70}{28,572,608.70} \\approx 0.293 \\]\n\nConvert to percentage:\n\\[ 0.293 \\times 100\\% = 29.30\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -10,442,735.47\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 8,028,630.43\n\nCalculate:\n\\[ \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43} \\approx -1.30 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.20', 'Gross Profit Margin': '29.30%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.30'}}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - Total Liabilities: 8,028,630.43\n   - Total Assets: 39,772,748.32\n   - 8,028,630.43 / 39,772,748.32 ≈ 0.20 ✔\n\n2. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: 8,372,608.70\n   - Revenue: 28,572,608.70\n   - 8,372,608.70 / 28,572,608.70 ≈ 0.293 → 29.30% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -10,442,735.47\n   - Current Liabilities: 8,028,630.43\n   - -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ -1.30 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer (Formatted)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.20', 'Gross Profit Margin': '29.30%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.30'}}\n```",
