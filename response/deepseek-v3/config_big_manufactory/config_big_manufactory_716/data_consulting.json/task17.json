                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio** based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nFirst, what is the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio? From what I understand, it's a measure of a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Operating Cash Flow** is the cash generated from the company's normal business operations.\n- **Total Debt** is the sum of all the company's liabilities that are considered debt (usually includes both short-term and long-term debt).\n\n### Identifying Operating Cash Flow\n\nFrom the **cash flow statement**, the **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** is given as **-10,442,735.47**. This is our Operating Cash Flow.\n\n### Identifying Total Debt\n\nNow, where do we find the Total Debt? In the **balance sheet**, under liabilities. \n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 8,028,630.43\n- There's no separate line for long-term liabilities; it seems all liabilities are current in this case.\n\nSo, **Total Debt** = Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, plug the numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43} \\approx -1.30 \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the ratio was negative (-3.90), which makes sense if operating cash flow is negative. Here, our operating cash flow is also negative, so a negative ratio is expected.\n\nBut let me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\n- Operating Cash Flow: -10,442,735.47 (from cash flow statement)\n- Total Debt: 8,028,630.43 (from balance sheet's total current liabilities)\n\nThe calculation seems correct.\n\n### Considering Other Liabilities\n\nIs there any other debt not included in current liabilities? Looking at the balance sheet:\n\n- **Accounts Payable**: 6,600,000.00 (part of current liabilities)\n- **Taxes Payable**: 1,428,630.43 (part of current liabilities)\n- No long-term debt is listed.\n\nSo, total debt is indeed the sum of current liabilities, which is 8,028,630.43.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\n\\[ \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43} \\approx -1.30 \\]\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe answer should be presented in the specified JSON format with the ratio rounded to two decimal places.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.30'}}\n```\n\n### Potential Missteps\n\nInitially, I wondered if \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" could be used for total debt, but that includes equity, which is not debt. So, sticking with total current liabilities is correct here since there's no long-term debt listed.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the operating cash flow is indeed the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" and not mixing it up with other cash flow sections is crucial.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully going through the statements and performing the calculations, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is **-1.30**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.30'}}\n```",
