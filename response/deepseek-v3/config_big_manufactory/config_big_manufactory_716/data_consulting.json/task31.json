                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand what each term means and where to find the numbers in the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n**Given**:\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all sales are credit sales) = Main Business Revenue = 28,572,608.70\n- Accounts Receivable at the end = 14,921,566.06\n- Since there's no beginning Accounts Receivable (it's 0 at the initial date), the average is just the ending amount.\n\n**Calculation**:\n\\[ \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 14,921,566.06}{2} = 7,460,783.03 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{28,572,608.70}{7,460,783.03} \\approx 3.83 \\]\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, they seem to have used the ending Accounts Receivable directly instead of averaging, which might be because the beginning was zero. If we do that:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{28,572,608.70}{14,921,566.06} \\approx 1.91 \\]\n\nBut averaging seems more correct. Maybe the example had a typo. I'll stick with averaging unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut looking back at the example:\n- Their Net Credit Sales = 5,431,018.59\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 2,429,482.13\n- Beginning = 0\n- They calculated it as 4.47, which is 5,431,018.59 / ( (0 + 2,429,482.13)/2 ) = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47\n\nSo they did average it. So I'll do the same:\n\n\\[ \\frac{28,572,608.70}{7,460,783.03} \\approx 3.83 \\]\n\nBut to match their method, let's confirm:\n\nAverage AR = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2\n= (0 + 14,921,566.06) / 2 = 7,460,783.03\nNet Credit Sales = 28,572,608.70\nRatio = 28,572,608.70 / 7,460,783.03 ≈ 3.83\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Given**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10,442,735.47\n- Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n\n**Calculation**:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43} \\approx -1.30 \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems identical to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided (both were -3.90 in the example). So I'll use the same calculation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43} \\approx -1.30 \\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Given**:\n- Net Sales = Main Business Revenue = 28,572,608.70\n- Total Assets at beginning = 28,000,000.00\n- Total Assets at end = 39,772,748.32\n\n**Calculation**:\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{28,000,000.00 + 39,772,748.32}{2} = \\frac{67,772,748.32}{2} = 33,886,374.16 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{28,572,608.70}{33,886,374.16} \\approx 0.84 \\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures the proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\n**Given**:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 31,744,117.89\n\n**Calculation**:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{8,028,630.43}{31,744,117.89} \\approx 0.25 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.83', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.30', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.30', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.84', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.25'}}\n```\n\n**Verification**:\n\nLet me quickly verify the calculations:\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover:\n   - Net Sales: 28,572,608.70\n   - Avg AR: (0 + 14,921,566.06)/2 = 7,460,783.03\n   - 28,572,608.70 / 7,460,783.03 ≈ 3.83 ✔\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -10,442,735.47\n   - Current Liabilities: 8,028,630.43\n   - -10,442,735.47 / 8,028,630.43 ≈ -1.30 ✔\n\n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities: Same as above ✔\n\n4. Total Asset Turnover:\n   - Net Sales: 28,572,608.70\n   - Avg Assets: (28,000,000 + 39,772,748.32)/2 = 33,886,374.16\n   - 28,572,608.70 / 33,886,374.16 ≈ 0.84 ✔\n\n5. Debt to Equity:\n   - Total Liabilities: 8,028,630.43\n   - Total Equity: 31,744,117.89\n   - 8,028,630.43 / 31,744,117.89 ≈ 0.25 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
