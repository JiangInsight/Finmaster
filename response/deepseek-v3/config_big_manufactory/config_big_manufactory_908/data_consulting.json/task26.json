                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. \n\n### 1. Understanding the Ratios\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\nThis measures how effectively a company is using its shareholders' equity to generate profit. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n*Note:* Sometimes, the ending shareholder's equity is used if beginning figures aren't provided or if it's a single period calculation. Here, we have both initial and end amounts, so we can calculate average equity.\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nThis shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n*Note:* Total liabilities are the sum of current and non-current liabilities. Here, only current liabilities are provided.\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\nThis indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\n### 2. Extracting Necessary Data from the Financial Statements\n\nLet's pull out the numbers we need from each statement.\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Assets (End):** 33,082,821.36\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End):** 3,143,833.89\n  - *Assuming no non-current liabilities since they're not mentioned.*\n- **Paid-in Capital (End):** 28,000,000.00\n- **Retained Earnings (End):** 1,938,987.47\n- **Total Owner's Equity (End):** 29,938,987.47\n- **Initial Owner's Equity:** 28,000,000.00 (since retained earnings were 0 initially)\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- **Net Profit:** 1,938,987.47\n- **Total Revenue:** 22,876,677.56\n- **Gross Profit:** 6,476,677.56\n\n### 3. Calculating Each Ratio\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\n\\[ \\text{Average Shareholder's Equity} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Equity} + \\text{Ending Equity}}{2} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{28,000,000 + 29,938,987.47}{2} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{57,938,987.47}{2} \\]\n\\[ = 28,969,493.735 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{1,938,987.47}{28,969,493.735} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\approx 6.69\\% \\]\n\n*Wait a minute, the initial equity was 28,000,000 (paid-in capital) + 0 (retained earnings) = 28,000,000. Ending equity is 29,938,987.47. So the calculation seems correct.*\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Current Liabilities} = 3,143,833.89 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Assets} = 33,082,821.36 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,143,833.89}{33,082,821.36} \\]\n\\[ \\approx 0.095 \\]\n*But looking at the example, they might have used more liabilities if available. Here, only current liabilities are given, so it's 0.095.*\n\nWait, in the example, they had:\nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no non-current liabilities were listed), and the ratio was 0.14. So similarly here, it's just current liabilities over total assets.\n\nSo, 3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.095 or 0.10 if rounding to two decimal places.\n\nBut the example had:\nTotal Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nTotal Assets: 13,216,409.49\nRatio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14\n\nSimilarly here, it's about 0.095. Maybe the example had more liabilities not shown, but here it's clear.\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{6,476,677.56}{22,876,677.56} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\approx 28.31\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers:\n\n- **ROE:**\n  - Net Profit: 1,938,987.47\n  - Avg Equity: (28,000,000 + 29,938,987.47)/2 = 28,969,493.735\n  - ROE: 1,938,987.47 / 28,969,493.735 ≈ 0.0669 → 6.69%\n\n- **Debt to Asset:**\n  - Total Liabilities: 3,143,833.89\n  - Total Assets: 33,082,821.36\n  - Ratio: 3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.095\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin:**\n  - Gross Profit: 6,476,677.56\n  - Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n  - Margin: 6,476,677.56 / 22,876,677.56 ≈ 0.2831 → 28.31%\n\n### 5. Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- **ROE:** 6.69%\n- **Debt to Asset Ratio:** 0.095 (or 0.10 if rounding)\n- **Gross Profit Margin:** 28.31%\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, they presented ROE and Gross Profit Margin with two decimal places, and Debt to Asset Ratio as a decimal to two places. So, I'll follow that format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.69%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.31%'}}\n```\n\n*Note:* The Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.095, but rounding to two decimal places gives 0.10. If more precision is preferred, it could be 0.09 or 0.095, but given the example showed 0.14 (which was 0.140...), two decimal places seem appropriate here as well.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.69%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.31%'}}\n```",
