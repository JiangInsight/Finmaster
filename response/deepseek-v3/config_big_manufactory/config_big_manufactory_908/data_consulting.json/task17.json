In this case, it is -16,772,398.72.\n\n2. **Identify the Total Debt**: The total debt is the sum of all liabilities. From the balance sheet, the Total Current Liabilities are 3,143,833.89. There are no non-current liabilities listed, so the total debt is 3,143,833.89.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-16,772,398.72}{3,143,833.89} \\approx -5.33\n   \\]\n\n4. **Present the Answer**: The ratio is rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-5.33'} }\n```",
