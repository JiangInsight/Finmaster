                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I recall that the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses are deducted. It's calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us a percentage that represents how much of each dollar earned by the company is profit.\n\n### Identifying the Necessary Values\nFrom the given income statement, I can see two key figures:\n\n1. **Net Profit**: This is the bottom line after all expenses, including taxes, have been subtracted from the revenue. In the problem, it's given as:\n   - Net Profit: 1,938,987.47\n\n2. **Total Revenue**: This is the total income generated by the company from its business activities. Here, it's:\n   - Total Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,938,987.47}{22,876,677.56} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide the Net Profit by the Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,938,987.47}{22,876,677.56} \\approx 0.08476 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.08476 \\times 100 \\approx 8.476\\% \\]\n\n### Rounding the Result\nLooking at the example provided, the Net Profit Margin was rounded to two decimal places. So, I'll do the same:\n\n\\[ 8.476\\% \\approx 8.48\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let's double-check:\n\n- 22,876,677.56 * 8.476% ≈ 22,876,677.56 * 0.08476 ≈ 1,938,987.47\n\nThis matches the given Net Profit, so the calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter performing the calculations, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 8.48%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '8.48%'} }\n```",
