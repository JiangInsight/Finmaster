                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72\nFrom the balance sheet (end date):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculation:\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.33\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities are:\n- Accounts Payable = 2,000,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 1,143,833.89\nTotal Current Liabilities (which seems to be the total debt here) = 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculation:\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.33\n\n*Note: If there were long-term liabilities, we'd include those in total debt, but here it seems all debt is current.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- COGS = 16,400,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- Ending Inventory = 6,600,000.00\nAverage Inventory = (Initial + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 6,600,000) / 2 = 3,300,000.00\n\nCalculation:\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 16,400,000 / 3,300,000 ≈ 4.97\n\n*Wait a minute, in the example provided, the Inventory Turnover Ratio was calculated differently. The example used COGS / Ending Inventory, not average. Maybe the company expects us to use ending inventory only. Let me check:*\n\nAlternative Calculation (using Ending Inventory only):\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 16,400,000 / 6,600,000 ≈ 2.48\n\nHmm, the example had:\nCOGS = 4,410,000\nEnding Inventory = 5,090,000\nRatio = 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.87, but the given solution was 1.73, which is COGS / Average Inventory (since initial was 0, average is 2,545,000; 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73). So the correct approach is COGS / Average Inventory.\n\nSo for our case:\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 6,600,000) / 2 = 3,300,000\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 16,400,000 / 3,300,000 ≈ 4.97\n\nBut the example's answer was 1.73, which matches COGS / Average Inventory. So our calculation is correct at ≈4.97.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,938,987.47\n\nCalculation:\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105\n\n*Looking at the example: Total Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92, Equity = 11,354,858.57; Ratio = 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16, which matches the given solution. So our calculation seems correct.*\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 22,474,420.77\n- Inventory = 6,600,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Assets = 22,474,420.77 - 6,600,000 = 15,874,420.77\nQuick Ratio = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.05\n\n*Checking the example: Current Assets = 7,956,806.47, Inventory = 5,090,000, Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92; Quick Ratio = (7,956,806.47 - 5,090,000) / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54, which matches. So our calculation is correct.*\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 22,474,420.77\n- Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 22,474,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 7.15\n\n*Example check: Current Assets = 7,956,806.47, Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92; Ratio = 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.27, which matches. So our calculation is correct.*\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter carefully calculating each ratio, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-5.33', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-5.33', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '4.97', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.10', 'Quick Ratio': '5.05', 'Current Ratio': '7.15'}}\n```\n\n*Wait a second, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.105, which rounds to 0.11, not 0.10. Let me correct that.*\n\nCorrected Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-5.33', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-5.33', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '4.97', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Quick Ratio': '5.05', 'Current Ratio': '7.15'}}\n```\n\n*Also, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is 16,400,000 / 3,300,000 = 4.969..., so 4.97 is correct.*\n\nEverything else seems accurate based on the calculations and cross-checking with the example.",
