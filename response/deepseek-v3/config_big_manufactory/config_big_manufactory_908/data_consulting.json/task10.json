I'm trying to calculate the \"Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\" based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Ratio\nFirst, I need to understand what this ratio represents. From what I know, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's a liquidity ratio that shows how well a company can meet its short-term obligations with the cash it generates from its core business activities.\n\nThe formula for this ratio is:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Required Numbers\nFrom the given financial statements, I need to find:\n1. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: This should be in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Total Current Liabilities**: This should be in the balance sheet at the end of the period.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement:\n- Under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\", there's \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" with an amount of \"-16772398.72\" as of \"2024-02-05\".\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n- Under \"Total Current Liabilities\", the \"End_amount\" is \"3143833.89\" as of \"2024-02-05\".\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-16772398.72}{3143833.89} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{-16772398.72}{3143833.89} \\approx -5.334 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, it's approximately -5.33.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is indeed negative, which means the company had a net outflow from operations.\n- Current Liabilities are positive.\n- Dividing a large negative number by a smaller positive number gives a negative result, which makes sense here.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is approximately -5.33.\n\nHere's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-5.33'}}\n```",
