                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested metrics based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFree Cash Flow is typically calculated as:\n**FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures (CapEx)**\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -16,772,398.72\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (which is CapEx): 2,729,032.26\n\nBut looking at the cash flow statement, \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is already -2,729,032.26, which is just the negative of CapEx (since purchasing assets is a cash outflow). \n\nHowever, in the example provided, FCF seems to be the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents, which is -19,501,430.98. This makes sense because FCF is essentially the cash the company generates after accounting for outflows to support operations and maintain capital assets.\n\nSo, **FCF = -19,501,430.98**\n\n### 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA is calculated as:\n**ROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets**\n\nFirst, calculate Average Total Assets:\n- Initial Total Assets: 28,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets: 33,082,821.36\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial + End) / 2 = (28,000,000 + 33,082,821.36) / 2 = 30,541,410.68\n\nNet Profit: 1,938,987.47\n\nROA = 1,938,987.47 / 30,541,410.68 ≈ 0.0635 or 6.35%\n\n### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE is calculated as:\n**ROE = Net Profit / Average Shareholders' Equity**\n\nAverage Shareholders' Equity:\n- Initial Equity: 28,000,000.00\n- End Equity: 29,938,987.47\n- Average = (28,000,000 + 29,938,987.47) / 2 = 28,969,493.735\n\nROE = 1,938,987.47 / 28,969,493.735 ≈ 0.0669 or 6.69%\n\n### 4. Net Cash Ratio\nNet Cash Ratio is calculated as:\n**Net Cash Ratio = (Cash and Cash Equivalents - Current Liabilities) / Current Liabilities**\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End): 627,601.28\n- Bank Deposits (End): -129,032.26\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents = 627,601.28 + (-129,032.26) = 498,569.02\n- Current Liabilities (End): 3,143,833.89\n\nNet Cash Ratio = (498,569.02 - 3,143,833.89) / 3,143,833.89 = (-2,645,264.87) / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -0.841 or -84.1%\n\nThis negative ratio indicates that the company doesn't have enough cash to cover its current liabilities.\n\n### 5. Net Profit Margin\nNet Profit Margin is calculated as:\n**Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue**\n\nNet Profit: 1,938,987.47\nTotal Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n\nNet Profit Margin = 1,938,987.47 / 22,876,677.56 ≈ 0.0847 or 8.47%\n\n### 6. Gross Profit Margin\nGross Profit Margin is calculated as:\n**Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue**\n\nGross Profit: 6,476,677.56\nTotal Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n\nGross Profit Margin = 6,476,677.56 / 22,876,677.56 ≈ 0.2831 or 28.31%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-19501430.98', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '6.35%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.69%', 'Net Cash Ratio': '-84.10%', 'Net Profit Margin': '8.47%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.31%'}}\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me quickly verify the calculations:\n\n1. **FCF**: Matches the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n2. **ROA**: 1,938,987.47 / ~30.54 million ≈ 6.35% - Correct.\n3. **ROE**: 1,938,987.47 / ~28.97 million ≈ 6.69% - Correct.\n4. **Net Cash Ratio**: (498,569.02 - 3,143,833.89) / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -0.841 → -84.1% - Correct.\n5. **Net Profit Margin**: ~1.94 million / ~22.88 million ≈ 8.47% - Correct.\n6. **Gross Profit Margin**: ~6.48 million / ~22.88 million ≈ 28.31% - Correct.\n\nEverything checks out!",
