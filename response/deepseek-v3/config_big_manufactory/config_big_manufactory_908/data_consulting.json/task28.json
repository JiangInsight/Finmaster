                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We'll calculate three ratios: Debt to Asset Ratio, Gross Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 3,143,833.89\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities:** Not provided, but looking at the balance sheet, it seems there are no non-current liabilities listed (only current liabilities and owner's equity are mentioned).\n  \nAssuming that all liabilities are current (since non-current liabilities aren't listed), then:\n- **Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89**\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 33,082,821.36\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,143,833.89}{33,082,821.36} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,143,833.89}{33,082,821.36} \\approx 0.095 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 0.095 or 9.5%.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated using only current liabilities even though non-current liabilities weren't present. So, following that approach seems correct here.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 6,476,677.56\n- **Total Revenue:** 22,876,677.56\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{6,476,677.56}{22,876,677.56} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6,476,677.56}{22,876,677.56} \\approx 0.283 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.283 \\times 100\\% \\approx 28.3\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -16,772,398.72\n- **Total Current Liabilities (from balance sheet):** 3,143,833.89\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-16,772,398.72}{3,143,833.89} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-16,772,398.72}{3,143,833.89} \\approx -5.335 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling all these calculations into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.095', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.30%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-5.34'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the calculations quickly.\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - 3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.095 (correct)\n\n2. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - 6,476,677.56 / 22,876,677.56 ≈ 0.283 → 28.3% (correct)\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n   - -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.335 (rounded to -5.34)\n\nEverything checks out! \n\n**Note on Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nIn the given example, non-current liabilities weren't present, and only current liabilities were used to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio. Similarly, in this problem, only current liabilities are provided, so the calculation is based on that. If there were non-current liabilities, they should be included in total liabilities. Here, it seems they're absent, so the ratio is based solely on current liabilities. \n\nThus, the final answer is accurate based on the provided data.",
