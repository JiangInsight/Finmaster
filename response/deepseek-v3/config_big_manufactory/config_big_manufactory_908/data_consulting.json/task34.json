                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step, explaining how to calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculation:\n- -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.33\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89 (since there's no long-term debt mentioned)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,938,987.47\n\nCalculation:\n- 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105\n\nWait a minute, in the example, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated as Total Current Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity. But traditionally, Debt to Equity includes all liabilities (both current and long-term) divided by equity. Here, since only current liabilities are given, we'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105\n\nBut looking back at the example, it seems they used Total Current Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity, giving 0.16 in their case. Maybe they included something else. Here, we'll stick with current liabilities only since that's all we have.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 22,876,677.56\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 28,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 33,082,821.36\n- Average Total Assets = (28,000,000 + 33,082,821.36) / 2 = 30,541,410.68\n\nCalculation:\n- 22,876,677.56 / 30,541,410.68 ≈ 0.749\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 22,474,420.77\n- Inventory = 6,600,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculation:\n- (22,474,420.77 - 6,600,000) / 3,143,833.89 = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.05\n\nWait, let's check the components of quick assets:\nQuick assets typically include Cash, Marketable Securities, and Accounts Receivable.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 627,601.28\n- Bank Deposits = -129,032.26 (negative? That's unusual, maybe it's a typo or overdraft)\n- Interest Receivable = 13,240.11\n- Accounts Receivable = 15,362,611.64\n\nAssuming Bank Deposits negative is treated as zero for quick assets (since negative cash isn't a quick asset):\nQuick Assets = 627,601.28 + 0 + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64 ≈ 16,003,453.03\n\nThen Quick Ratio = 16,003,453.03 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.09\n\nBut if we include the negative bank deposits:\nQuick Assets = 627,601.28 + (-129,032.26) + 13,240.11 + 15,362,611.64 ≈ 15,874,420.77\nWhich gives the same as above, ~5.05.\n\nHmm, the example had a quick ratio of 1.54, which is more typical. Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe only Cash and Accounts Receivable are considered, excluding Interest Receivable.\n\nQuick Assets = Cash + Accounts Receivable = (627,601.28 - 129,032.26) + 15,362,611.64 ≈ 498,569.02 + 15,362,611.64 ≈ 15,861,180.66\nQuick Ratio = 15,861,180.66 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.04\n\nStill high. Maybe the example included Inventory in quick assets, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the current liabilities in the example were higher relative to quick assets.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct quick assets are Cash + Accounts Receivable = 498,569.02 + 15,362,611.64 = 15,861,180.66\nQuick Ratio = 15,861,180.66 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.04\n\nThis seems correct based on standard definitions.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nSame as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio, which we calculated as -5.33.\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,938,987.47\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Equity = 28,000,000.00\n- End Equity = 29,938,987.47\n- Average Equity = (28,000,000 + 29,938,987.47) / 2 = 28,969,493.735\n\nCalculation:\n- 1,938,987.47 / 28,969,493.735 ≈ 0.0669 or 6.69%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales):\nFrom income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n\nFrom balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 15,362,611.64\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 15,362,611.64) / 2 = 7,681,305.82\n\nCalculation:\n- 22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 ≈ 2.98\n\nBut in the example, they seemed to use End Accounts Receivable instead of average, giving a higher ratio. If we use End:\n22,876,677.56 / 15,362,611.64 ≈ 1.49\n\nAlternatively, if the period is less than a year, we might annualize it, but the example didn't. Maybe the correct approach is to use average.\n\nGiven the example used End, let's do both:\nAverage: ~2.98\nEnd: ~1.49\n\nThe example had 4.47, which is higher, suggesting they might have used a different period or initial was not zero. Here initial is zero, so using end might make more sense to avoid division by zero in average.\n\nSo, using End: 22,876,677.56 / 15,362,611.64 ≈ 1.49\n\nBut the example had higher, maybe their sales were higher relative to receivables. Here, it's lower.\n\nAlternatively, if the period is from Dec 31 to Feb 5, that's about 1 month and 5 days, or roughly 1.167 months. To annualize:\n\nMonthly sales = 22,876,677.56 / 1.167 ≈ 19,602,979.57 per month\nAnnualized sales ≈ 19,602,979.57 * 12 ≈ 235,235,754.84\nThen AR Turnover = 235,235,754.84 / 15,362,611.64 ≈ 15.31\n\nBut this seems too high compared to the example. Maybe better to stick with non-annualized.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll use the simple non-averaged, non-annualized:\n22,876,677.56 / 15,362,611.64 ≈ 1.49\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter recalculating and checking, here's the most reasonable set of answers:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-5.33', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.75', 'Quick Ratio': '5.04', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-5.33', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.69%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '1.49'}}\n```\n\nHowever, some ratios seem unusually high (like Quick Ratio), which might indicate a need to recheck components or definitions. Given the data strictly, these are the calculations.\n\n**Revised Based on Possible Misinterpretations:**\n\nIf we consider that \"Bank Deposits\" being negative might imply that it's a liability (overdraft), then:\n\nCurrent Liabilities would include that, but it's already included in Total Current Liabilities as given (3,143,833.89). \n\nAlternatively, maybe Quick Assets exclude negative bank deposits, treating them as zero:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Accounts Receivable = 627,601.28 + 15,362,611.64 = 15,990,212.92\nQuick Ratio = 15,990,212.92 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.09\n\nStill high. Maybe the correct interpretation is that quick assets are Cash (positive only) + Accounts Receivable:\n\nCash = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits (if positive) = 627,601.28 + 0 (since bank deposits are negative) = 627,601.28\nAccounts Receivable = 15,362,611.64\nQuick Assets = 627,601.28 + 15,362,611.64 = 15,990,212.92\nQuick Ratio = 15,990,212.92 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.09\n\nAlternatively, if we exclude Interest Receivable from quick assets (though it's usually included), then:\n\nQuick Assets = 627,601.28 - 129,032.26 + 15,362,611.64 = 15,861,180.66\nQuick Ratio = 15,861,180.66 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.04\n\nGiven that, the high quick ratio seems correct based on the data, indicating very high liquidity relative to current liabilities.\n\n**Final Confirmed Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-5.33', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.75', 'Quick Ratio': '5.04', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-5.33', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.69%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '1.49'}}\n```",
