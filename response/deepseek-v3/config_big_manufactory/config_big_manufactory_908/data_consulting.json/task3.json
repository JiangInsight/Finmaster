                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Asset Ratio\nFirst, I need to understand what the Debt to Asset Ratio is. From what I know, it's a financial metric that shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nBut sometimes, \"Total Debt\" can be interpreted as \"Total Liabilities.\" So, I need to see what's given in the balance sheet to determine which one to use.\n\n### Looking at the Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet provided has several accounts, but the key ones for this calculation are:\n\n1. **Total Assets**: This is given directly as \"Total Assets\" at the end of the reporting period.\n   - End_amount: 33,082,821.36\n\n2. **Total Liabilities**: This seems to be represented by \"Total Current Liabilities\" since there are no non-current liabilities listed.\n   - End_amount for Total Current Liabilities: 3,143,833.89\n\nThere's no separate line for long-term debt or other liabilities, so I'll assume that \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the total debt for this calculation.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plugging the numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{3,143,833.89}{33,082,821.36} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,143,833.89}{33,082,821.36} \\approx 0.095 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 0.10.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided, the solution was {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.14'}, and their calculation was based on \"Total Current Liabilities\" divided by \"Total Assets\":\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,861,550.92}{13,216,409.49} \\approx 0.14 \\]\n\nSo, it seems consistent to use \"Total Current Liabilities\" as the numerator.\n\n### Verifying\nJust to double-check, is \"Total Current Liabilities\" the only debt here? Looking at the accounts:\n\n- Accounts Payable: 2,000,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 1,143,833.89\n- Total Current Liabilities: 3,143,833.89\n\nNo other liabilities are listed, so yes, that seems correct.\n\n### Final Calculation\nSo, the calculation is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,143,833.89}{33,082,821.36} \\approx 0.095 \\]\n\nBut the example rounded to two decimal places, so should we say 0.10 or keep more precision? The example had 0.14, which is two decimal places, so maybe we should present it as '0.10'.\n\nAlternatively, calculating more precisely:\n\n3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36 â‰ˆ 0.095016\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.10\n\nBut if we consider that the example might have used more precision before rounding, maybe it's better to keep more digits. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is often expressed as a decimal rounded to two places, so 0.10 seems appropriate.\n\nBut looking at the numbers, 3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36 is closer to 0.095, which is approximately 0.10 when rounded.\n\n### Possible Misinterpretation\nIs there a chance that \"Total Liabilities\" includes more than just \"Total Current Liabilities\"? The balance sheet shows:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities: 3,143,833.89\n- Total Owner's Equity: 29,938,987.47\n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity: 33,082,821.36\n\nWait, \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" should equal \"Total Assets\", which it does (33,082,821.36). \n\nSo, \"Total Liabilities\" would be \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" minus \"Total Owner's Equity\":\n\n33,082,821.36 - 29,938,987.47 = 3,143,833.89\n\nWhich is exactly \"Total Current Liabilities\". So, no other liabilities are present.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the Debt to Asset Ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,143,833.89}{33,082,821.36} \\approx 0.095 \\]\n\nExpressed as a decimal rounded to two places: 0.10\n\nBut the example gave it as '0.14', which is two decimal places without a leading zero, so maybe we should present it as '0.10' or '.10'. Following the example's format, it's '0.10'.\n\nHowever, the example's solution was '0.14', which is two decimal places, so perhaps '0.10' is correct.\n\nBut calculating more precisely, it's closer to 0.095, which rounds to 0.10.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter careful consideration, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.10 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10'} }\n```",
