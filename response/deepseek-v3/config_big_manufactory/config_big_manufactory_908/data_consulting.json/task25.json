                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 3,143,833.89\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 29,938,987.47\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,143,833.89}{29,938,987.47} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{3,143,833.89}{29,938,987.47} \\approx 0.105 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.105.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 1,938,987.47\n- **Total Revenue:** 22,876,677.56\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,938,987.47}{22,876,677.56} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nLet's calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{1,938,987.47}{22,876,677.56} \\approx 0.08475 \\]\n\\[ 0.08475 \\times 100\\% \\approx 8.475\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 8.48%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -16,772,398.72\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-16,772,398.72}{3,143,833.89} \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{-16,772,398.72}{3,143,833.89} \\approx -5.335 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is approximately -5.34.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.105', 'Net Profit Margin': '8.48%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-5.34'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 3,143,833.89\n   - Equity: 29,938,987.47\n   - 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: 1,938,987.47\n   - Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n   - (1,938,987.47 / 22,876,677.56) * 100 ≈ 8.475% ✔ (rounded to 8.48%)\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -16,772,398.72\n   - Current Liabilities: 3,143,833.89\n   - -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.335 ✔ (rounded to -5.34)\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n**Note on Rounding:**\nThe example provided had ratios rounded to two decimal places, so I've done the same here for consistency. The Net Profit Margin was approximately 8.475%, which rounds to 8.48%. Similarly, the other ratios are presented with three decimal places as in the example, but since our calculations resulted in up to three decimal places, we've kept them as is unless further rounding was needed (like for the Net Profit Margin). \n\nHowever, the example had 'Debt to Equity Ratio' as '0.16' which is two decimal places, so we can present ours as '0.10' if we round to two decimal places. But since 0.105 is more precise, and the example might have had a different calculation, I'll stick with '0.105'.\n\nSimilarly, 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio' in the example was '-3.90' (two decimal places), so we can present ours as '-5.34' (two decimal places).\n\nFor 'Net Profit Margin', the example had '-30.29%' (two decimal places), so ours is '8.48%' (two decimal places).\n\nAdjusting the final answer to two decimal places where applicable:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.10', 'Net Profit Margin': '8.48%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-5.34'} }\n```\n\nBut since 0.105 is closer to 0.11 when rounding to two decimal places, let's correct that:\n\n0.105 rounded to two decimal places is 0.11 (since the third digit is 5, we round up the second digit).\n\nSo, updating:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Net Profit Margin': '8.48%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-5.34'} }\n```\n\nThis seems more accurate based on standard rounding rules. \n\n**Final Verified Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Net Profit Margin': '8.48%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-5.34'} }\n```",
