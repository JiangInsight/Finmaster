                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Net Cash Ratio, Current Assets Turnover Ratio, and Quick Ratio based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Net Cash Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with its cash and cash equivalents. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**: This shows how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}}\n   \\]\n   Since we only have ending current assets, we'll use that as a proxy for average current assets unless initial amounts are significantly different, which in this case they are, so we'll calculate the average.\n\n3. **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)**: This measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   Here, marketable securities aren't listed, so we'll use Cash and Accounts Receivable.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (end amounts for 2024-02-05):\n\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n  - Cash on Hand: 627,601.28\n  - Bank Deposits: -129,032.26 (negative, which is unusual; might be an overdraft)\n  \n  Normally, cash equivalents are positive, but since bank deposits are negative, we might consider this as zero or adjust accordingly. For this calculation, I'll sum them:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} = 627,601.28 + (-129,032.26) = 498,569.02\n  \\]\n  (This matches the \"Ending Balance\" in the cash flow statement.)\n\n- **Accounts Receivable**: 15,362,611.64\n- **Inventory**: 6,600,000.00\n- **Total Current Assets**: 22,474,420.77\n- **Current Liabilities**: 3,143,833.89\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 22,876,677.56\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (initial amounts for 2023-12-31):\n\n- **Initial Current Assets**: 20,000,000.00\n\n### Calculating Average Current Assets\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2} = \\frac{20,000,000 + 22,474,420.77}{2} = 21,237,210.385\n\\]\n\n### Calculating the Ratios\n\n1. **Net Cash Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{498,569.02}{3,143,833.89} \\approx 0.1586\n   \\]\n   Rounded to two decimal places: 0.16\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} = \\frac{22,876,677.56}{21,237,210.385} \\approx 1.077\n   \\]\n   Rounded to two decimal places: 1.08\n\n3. **Quick Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{498,569.02 + 15,362,611.64}{3,143,833.89} = \\frac{15,861,180.66}{3,143,833.89} \\approx 5.045\n   \\]\n   Rounded to two decimal places: 5.05\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\n- **Net Cash Ratio**: 498,569.02 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 0.16\n- **Current Assets Turnover**: 22,876,677.56 / 21,237,210.385 ≈ 1.08\n- **Quick Ratio**: (498,569.02 + 15,362,611.64) / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.05\n\nAll calculations seem correct based on the provided data.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '0.16', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '1.08', 'Quick Ratio': '5.05'}}\n```",
