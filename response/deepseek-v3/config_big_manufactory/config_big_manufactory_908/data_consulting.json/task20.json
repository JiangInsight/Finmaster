                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial task step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n   \n   **Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It indicates the company's short-term liquidity.\n   \n   **Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements:\n\n**Income Statement**:\n- Total Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 16,400,000.00\n- Gross Profit: 6,476,677.56\n\n**Cash Flow Statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -16,772,398.72\n\n**Balance Sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 3,143,833.89\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the Gross Profit Margin formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{6,476,677.56}{22,876,677.56} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{6,476,677.56}{22,876,677.56} \\approx 0.2831\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.2831 \\times 100 \\approx 28.31\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **28.31%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nUsing the Operating Cash Flow Ratio formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-16,772,398.72}{3,143,833.89}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{-16,772,398.72}{3,143,833.89} \\approx -5.335\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **-5.34**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: 6,476,677.56\n   - Total Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n   - 6,476,677.56 / 22,876,677.56 ≈ 0.2831 → 28.31%\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -16,772,398.72\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 3,143,833.89\n   - -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.335 → -5.34\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '28.31%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-5.34'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin (28.31%)**: This indicates that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about 28 cents after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a healthy margin, suggesting good control over production costs relative to sales.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio (-5.34)**: A negative ratio is concerning. It means the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities. This could signal liquidity issues, especially if this trend continues over time. The company might be investing heavily in operations (like increasing inventory or accounts receivable) which is consuming cash, or it might have high operating expenses not covered by current revenues.\n\nIn summary, while the company is making a decent gross profit, its cash flow from operations is negative, which could be a red flag regarding its ability to meet short-term obligations without additional financing.",
