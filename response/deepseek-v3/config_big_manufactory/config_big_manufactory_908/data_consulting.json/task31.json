                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the five requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all sales are credit sales) = Main Business Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (from initial_amount on 2023-12-31)\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 15,362,611.64\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**  \n(0 + 15,362,611.64) / 2 = 7,681,305.82\n\n**Calculation:**  \n22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 ≈ 2.98\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n**Given:**\n- Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72\n- Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\n**Calculation:**  \n-16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.33\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis seems to be the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided (both had the same value). So, I'll use the same calculation.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n-16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.33\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales = Main Business Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n- Beginning Total Assets = 28,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 33,082,821.36\n\n**Average Total Assets:**  \n(28,000,000.00 + 33,082,821.36) / 2 = 30,541,410.68\n\n**Calculation:**  \n22,876,677.56 / 30,541,410.68 ≈ 0.75\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 3,143,833.89\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = Total Owner's Equity = 29,938,987.47\n\n**Calculation:**  \n3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.98', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-5.33', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-5.33', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.75', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11'} }\n```\n\n**Verification with Example:**\nLooking back at the example provided, the calculations seem consistent with how I approached them. For instance:\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover used net sales and average receivables.\n- Operating cash flow ratios used operating cash flow divided by current liabilities.\n- Total Asset Turnover used net sales over average total assets.\n- Debt to Equity used total liabilities over total equity.\n\nEverything checks out methodologically. The numbers in the problem are just larger, leading to different ratio values.",
