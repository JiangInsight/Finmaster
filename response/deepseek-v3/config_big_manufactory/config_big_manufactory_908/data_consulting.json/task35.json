                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount): 22,474,420.77\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 22,474,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 7.15\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit: 6,476,677.56\n- Total Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (6,476,677.56 / 22,876,677.56) * 100 ≈ 28.31%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities: Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89 (since no long-term liabilities are listed)\n- Total Assets: 33,082,821.36\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.095 or 9.5%\n\nWait a minute, in the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated using only current liabilities, but usually, it's total liabilities (current + long-term). Here, there's no long-term debt listed, so it's just current liabilities.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: 1,938,987.47\n- Total Revenue: 22,876,677.56\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (1,938,987.47 / 22,876,677.56) * 100 ≈ 8.48%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount): 627,601.28\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount): -129,032.26 (Negative bank deposits? This might imply overdrafts or negative balances, which are liabilities, not assets. Maybe we should consider only positive cash.)\n  \nAssuming \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" is the sum of Cash on Hand and positive Bank Deposits, but since Bank Deposits are negative, maybe only Cash on Hand is considered.\n\nAlternatively, from the cash flow statement:\n- Ending Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents: 498,569.02\n\nThis seems more reliable. So:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 498,569.02 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 0.16\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n**Formula:** Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -16,772,398.72\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -2,729,032.26\n\nCalculation:\nFCF = -16,772,398.72 + (-2,729,032.26) = -19,501,430.98\n\nWait, the \"Net Increase\" in cash is -19,501,430.98, which matches the sum above. So FCF is -19,501,430.98.\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Average Total Assets) * 100\n\nAverage Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial_amount (Beginning): 28,000,000.00\n- End_amount (Ending): 33,082,821.36\n\nAverage Total Assets = (28,000,000 + 33,082,821.36) / 2 = 30,541,410.68\n\nNet Profit: 1,938,987.47\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (1,938,987.47 / 30,541,410.68) * 100 ≈ 6.35%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '7.15', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.31%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.095', 'Net Profit Margin': '8.48%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '0.16', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-19501430.98', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '6.35%'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the Debt to Asset Ratio. The example had only current liabilities, and here we also have only current liabilities, so it's correct to use just that. \n\nAlso, for Cash to Current Debt Ratio, using the ending cash balance from the cash flow statement seems appropriate (498,569.02), leading to 0.16.\n\nEverything else seems correctly calculated based on the formulas and given data.\n\n**Final JSON:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '7.15', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.31%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.095', 'Net Profit Margin': '8.48%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '0.16', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-19501430.98', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '6.35%'} }\n```",
