                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Net Cash Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Net Cash Ratio**: This ratio assesses a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its cash and cash equivalents. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   However, in the given example, the \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\" was calculated instead, which is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}}\n   \\]\n   Given that the example provided seems to have calculated the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio instead of the Net Cash Ratio, I'll assume that's what's intended here. But to clarify, the Net Cash Ratio is typically as defined above. \n\n   Given the ambiguity, I'll calculate both:\n   - Net Cash Ratio (as traditionally defined)\n   - Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio (as per the example)\n\nBut since the example provided the latter, and the task mentions \"Net Cash Ratio\" which isn't standard, I'll proceed with the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio as in the example.\n\n### Calculating Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Liabilities**: This is the \"Total Current Liabilities\" since there are no non-current liabilities listed.\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n- **Total Assets**: 33,082,821.36\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,143,833.89}{33,082,821.36}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\\[\n\\frac{3,143,833.89}{33,082,821.36} \\approx 0.095\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.10\n\nBut in the example, it was rounded to two decimal places, so I'll do the same here.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72\n- Net Profit = 1,938,987.47\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-16,772,398.72}{1,938,987.47} \\approx -8.65\n\\]\n\nThis seems quite high in magnitude compared to the example's 4.41, but it's negative here because operating cash flow is negative while net profit is positive, which is unusual.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider absolute values (though this isn't standard), it would be 8.65, but the sign indicates that operating cash flow is moving opposite to net income.\n\nGiven that the example had a positive ratio despite negative numbers, perhaps it's the absolute value or perhaps the signs were both negative. Here, one is negative and one is positive, leading to a negative ratio.\n\nBut in the example:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7,259,994.10\n- Net Profit = -1,645,141.43\n- Ratio = -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 = 4.41\n\nAh, so both were negative, leading to a positive ratio. Here, one is negative, one is positive, so the ratio is negative.\n\nBut the task asks for \"Net Cash Ratio\", which isn't standard. Maybe it's supposed to be Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio as in the example.\n\nGiven that, and since the example had both numbers negative leading to a positive ratio, here it's negative, but perhaps we take absolute values or reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Net Cash Ratio\" is indeed Cash / Current Liabilities.\n\nFrom balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 627,601.28\n- Bank Deposits = -129,032.26\n- So, Cash and Cash Equivalents = 627,601.28 + (-129,032.26) = 498,569.02 (matches Ending Balance in cash flow)\n- Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{498,569.02}{3,143,833.89} \\approx 0.16\n\\]\n\nThis seems more plausible. Maybe the example had a mislabel, and \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\" was mistakenly called \"Net Cash Ratio\".\n\nGiven that, I think the intended ratios are:\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n2. Net Cash Ratio (Cash / Current Liabilities)\n\nSo, calculating:\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets = 3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.095 → 0.10 when rounded\n2. Net Cash Ratio = Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities = 498,569.02 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 0.1586 → 0.16 when rounded\n\nBut the example had Debt to Asset Ratio as 0.14 and the other as 4.41, which was Operating Cash Flow to Net Income.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll provide both possibilities.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAssuming \"Net Cash Ratio\" is Cash / Current Liabilities:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Net Cash Ratio': '0.16'}}\n```\n\nIf \"Net Cash Ratio\" is Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Net Cash Ratio': '-8.65'}}\n```\n\nGiven the example seems to have mislabeled, the first interpretation is more likely correct.\n\nThus, most likely:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Net Cash Ratio': '0.16'}}\n```\n\nBut the Debt to Asset Ratio calculation seems off compared to the example where Total Liabilities were 1,861,550.92 and Total Assets were 13,216,409.49, giving 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14, which matches the example.\n\nHere, Total Liabilities are 3,143,833.89, Total Assets are 33,082,821.36, so 3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.095, which rounds to 0.10, not 0.14.\n\nWait, in the example, Total Current Liabilities were 1,861,550.92, and Total Assets were 13,216,409.49, so 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.1409 → 0.14, correct.\n\nSimilarly here, 3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.095 → 0.10.\n\nSo Debt to Asset Ratio is correctly 0.10 here.\n\nNet Cash Ratio as Cash / Current Liabilities: 498,569.02 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 0.16.\n\nThus, final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Net Cash Ratio': '0.16'}}\n```",
