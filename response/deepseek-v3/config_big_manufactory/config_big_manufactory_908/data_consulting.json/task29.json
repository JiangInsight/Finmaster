                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 3,143,833.89\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,938,987.47\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** Net Profit / Total Revenue\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,938,987.47\n- Total Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = 1,938,987.47 / 22,876,677.56 ≈ 0.0847 or 8.47%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** Net Profit / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 33,082,821.36\n- Net Profit = 1,938,987.47\n\nCalculation:\nROA = 1,938,987.47 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.0586 or 5.86%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nFirst, we need to find the average accounts receivable. Since the initial amount is 0 and the end amount is 15,362,611.64, the average is:\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0 + 15,362,611.64) / 2 = 7,681,305.82\n\nFrom the income statement:\nTotal Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 ≈ 2.98\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Net Profit Margin': '8.47%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '5.86%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.98'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105 → Rounded to 0.11 seems appropriate.\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - 1,938,987.47 / 22,876,677.56 ≈ 0.0847 → 8.47% is correct.\n\n3. **ROA:**\n   - 1,938,987.47 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.0586 → 5.86% is correct.\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover:**\n   - Average AR = 7,681,305.82\n   - 22,876,677.56 / 7,681,305.82 ≈ 2.98 → Correct.\n\nEverything checks out! The final JSON is accurate based on the provided financial statements.",
