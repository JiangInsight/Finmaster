                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial task step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**\nGross Profit Margin is a profitability ratio that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 22,876,677.56\n- Gross Profit = 6,476,677.56\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{6,476,677.56}{22,876,677.56} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{6,476,677.56}{22,876,677.56} \\approx 0.283 \\]\n\\[ 0.283 \\times 100 \\approx 28.3\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 28.3%.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to identify:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72 (it's negative, which means cash outflow)\n\nFrom the balance sheet, \"Total Current Liabilities\" can be considered as the short-term debt, which is 3,143,833.89. However, if there's long-term debt, it should be added, but it's not provided in the balance sheet. Assuming that \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the only debt (since no long-term liabilities are listed), then Total Debt = 3,143,833.89.\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, the \"Total Current Liabilities\" was used as the debt for the calculation. So, we'll proceed similarly here.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-16,772,398.72}{3,143,833.89} \\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\\[ \\frac{-16,772,398.72}{3,143,833.89} \\approx -5.33 \\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately -5.33.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the provided example:\n- Gross Profit Margin was calculated as 18.80% from (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) = (1,021,018.59 / 5,431,018.59) ≈ 0.188 → 18.8%.\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was -3.90 from (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities) = (-7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92) ≈ -3.90.\n\nThis matches, so our approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '28.30%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-5.33'}}\n```\n\n**Wait a minute!** \n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, is \"Total Current Liabilities\" the only debt? Or should we consider other liabilities? The balance sheet shows:\n- Accounts Payable = 2,000,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 1,143,833.89\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\nNo other liabilities are listed, so it seems correct to use Total Current Liabilities as the debt for this calculation. \n\nHowever, in reality, Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable are not typically considered as \"debt\" in the traditional sense (like loans). Debt usually refers to interest-bearing liabilities like loans, bonds, etc. Since the example used Total Current Liabilities, and no other debt is provided, we'll proceed with that.\n\nBut if we think that only interest-bearing liabilities are debt, and none are listed, then the ratio might not be calculable properly. Given the data and the example, it's safest to follow the same approach as the example.\n\nThus, the answer remains:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '28.30%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-5.33'}}\n```\n\n**Alternative Consideration:**\n\nIf we assume that \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the correct denominator (as per the example), then -5.33 is correct. \n\nBut if we think that perhaps \"Total Liabilities\" should be used, and since \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" is 33,082,821.36, and \"Total Owner's Equity\" is 29,938,987.47, then:\n\nTotal Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Total Owner's Equity\n= 33,082,821.36 - 29,938,987.47 = 3,143,833.89\n\nWhich is the same as Total Current Liabilities. So, no change.\n\nTherefore, the answer is consistent.\n\n### Final Confirmation\n\nGiven that in both the example and the problem, \"Total Current Liabilities\" equals the difference between \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" and \"Total Owner's Equity\", it's appropriate to use \"Total Current Liabilities\" as the debt measure here.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '28.30%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-5.33'}}\n```",
