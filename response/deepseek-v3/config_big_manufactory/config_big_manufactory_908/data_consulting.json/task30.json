                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, using the data provided in the problem.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Assets (End_amount):** 22,474,420.77\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 22,474,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 7.15\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Inventory (End_amount):** 6,600,000.00\n- So, Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 22,474,420.77 - 6,600,000.00 = 15,874,420.77\n- **Current Liabilities:** 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.05\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets\n\nHere, \"Total Debt\" is typically considered as Total Liabilities. From the balance sheet:\n- **Total Liabilities:** It seems only current liabilities are given (3,143,833.89), and no long-term liabilities are listed. So, Total Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 33,082,821.36\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 3,143,833.89 / 33,082,821.36 ≈ 0.095 or 0.10 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Liabilities (Debt):** 3,143,833.89\n- **Total Owner's Equity (End_amount):** 29,938,987.47\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 3,143,833.89 / 29,938,987.47 ≈ 0.105 or 0.11 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -16,772,398.72\n- **Total Debt (Total Liabilities):** 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ -5.33\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling all these calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '7.15', 'Quick Ratio': '5.05', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-5.33'}}\n```\n\n### Verification\nLet me quickly verify one of the calculations to ensure accuracy. For the Current Ratio:\n- Current Assets: 22,474,420.77\n- Current Liabilities: 3,143,833.89\n- 22,474,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 7.15 (correct)\n\nSimilarly, Quick Ratio:\n- Quick Assets: 22,474,420.77 - 6,600,000 = 15,874,420.77\n- 15,874,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 5.05 (correct)\n\nThe other ratios also seem correctly calculated based on the provided data. \n\n**Note:** The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is negative because the operating cash flow is negative, which indicates that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its debts, which could be a concern. However, the high current and quick ratios suggest strong short-term liquidity. The low debt ratios indicate that the company is not heavily leveraged. \n\nThis seems consistent with the data where the company has significant current assets compared to its liabilities, but is experiencing a large outflow from operating activities, possibly due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory.",
