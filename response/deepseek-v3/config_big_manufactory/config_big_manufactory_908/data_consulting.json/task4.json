Since there are no non-current liabilities listed, the total liabilities are equal to the total current liabilities.\n\n2. **Identify Total Owner's Equity**: From the balance sheet, the \"Total Owner's Equity\" at the end of the reporting period is 29,938,987.47.\n\n3. **Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio**: The formula for the Debt to Equity Ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,143,833.89}{29,938,987.47} \\approx 0.105\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places, the ratio is 0.10.\n\n4. **Present the Solution**: The final answer is presented in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.10'} }\n```",
