                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n- **Total Current Assets (End_amount)**: 22,474,420.77\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount)**: 3,143,833.89\n- **Inventory**:\n  - Beginning Inventory (Initial_amount): 0.00\n  - Ending Inventory (End_amount): 6,600,000.00\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 16,400,000.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{22,474,420.77}{3,143,833.89}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{22,474,420.77}{3,143,833.89} \\approx 7.15\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **7.15**.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nFirst, calculate the Average Inventory:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 6,600,000}{2} = 3,300,000\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{16,400,000}{3,300,000} \\approx 4.97\n\\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **4.97**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n- **Current Assets**: 22,474,420.77\n- **Current Liabilities**: 3,143,833.89\n  - 22,474,420.77 / 3,143,833.89 ≈ 7.15 (correct)\n\n- **COGS**: 16,400,000\n- **Average Inventory**: (0 + 6,600,000)/2 = 3,300,000\n  - 16,400,000 / 3,300,000 ≈ 4.97 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '7.15', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '4.97'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Current Ratio**: A ratio above 1 indicates that the company has more current assets than current liabilities, which is good for short-term financial health. Here, 7.15 is quite high, suggesting strong liquidity.\n  \n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: A higher ratio generally indicates that inventory is selling quickly. 4.97 means the inventory is turned over almost 5 times during the period, which is efficient, but the interpretation can vary by industry.\n\nIf there's any additional context or industry benchmarks, these ratios could be further analyzed for better insights. But based on the given data, these are the calculated values.",
