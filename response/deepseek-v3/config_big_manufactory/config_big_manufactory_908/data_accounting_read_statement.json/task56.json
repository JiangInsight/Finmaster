This refers to the \"Depreciation\" expense recorded in the financial statements.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Task**: The task asks for the depreciation value, which is the systematic allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life. This is typically found in the income statement under expenses or in the cash flow statement under operating activities.\n\n2. **Checking the Income Statement**: In the provided income statement, there is a line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with an amount of \"120631.67\" dated \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Cross-Verification**: \n   - The cash flow statement also lists \"Depreciation\" under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" with the same value of \"120631.67\".\n   - The balance sheet shows \"Accumulated Depreciation\" under \"Total Non-current Assets\" with an end amount of \"120631.67\", which matches the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The depreciation value is consistently reported as \"120631.67\" across all relevant sections of the financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '120631.67'}}\n```",
