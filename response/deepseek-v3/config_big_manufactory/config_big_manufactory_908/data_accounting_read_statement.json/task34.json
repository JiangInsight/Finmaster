                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to look at the income statement provided and identify the three specific line items we need to extract:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**\n\n### Step 1: Identify Total Income from Ordinary Activities\nThis typically refers to the revenue generated from the main operations of the business. In income statements, this is often labeled as \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue.\" \n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n- \"Main Business Revenue\" is 22,876,677.56\n- \"Total Revenue\" is also 22,876,677.56\n\nBoth represent the total income from ordinary activities. Since \"Total Revenue\" is a more general term that encompasses all revenue from ordinary activities, we'll use that. \n\n**Value1: 22876677.56**\n\n### Step 2: Identify Carrying Amount of Inventories Sold\nThis is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold during the period. In accounting terms, this is commonly referred to as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\nLooking at the income statement:\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is 16,400,000.00\n\nThis matches our requirement.\n\n**Value2: 16400000.00**\n\n### Step 3: Identify Costs of General Management and Administration\nThese are the expenses related to the general administration and management of the company, not directly tied to production or sales. In income statements, this is usually labeled as \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\nLooking at the income statement:\n- \"Administrative Expenses\" is 1,192,395.86\n\nThis fits our need.\n\n**Value3: 1192395.86**\n\n### Verification:\nLet's cross-check with the example provided to ensure we're picking the right line items.\n\nIn the example:\n- 'value1' was \"Total Revenue\" (5431018.59)\n- 'value2' was \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (4410000.00)\n- 'value3' was \"Administrative Expenses\" (1425164.20)\n\nThis aligns perfectly with our selections:\n- Total Revenue → Total income from ordinary activities\n- Cost of Goods Sold → Carrying amount of inventories sold\n- Administrative Expenses → Costs of general management and administration\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '22876677.56', 'value2': '16400000.00', 'value3': '1192395.86'}}\n```",
