This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Receivable\" represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit. This is the item we need to extract.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and End Values**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item has:\n     - **Initial_amount**: 0.00 (as of the Initial_date: 2023-12-31)\n     - **End_amount**: 15362611.64 (as of the End_date: 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The initial value is '0.00'.\n   - The end value is '15362611.64'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '15362611.64'} }\n```",
