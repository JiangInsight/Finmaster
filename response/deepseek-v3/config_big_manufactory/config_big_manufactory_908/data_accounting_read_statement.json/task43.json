The \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section typically includes the beginning balance, ending balance, and the net increase or decrease.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, the \"Beginning Balance\" represents the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period. \n\n3. **Extract the Value**: From the given problem, the line item \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" has a value of \"20000000.00\" as of the date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20000000.00'}}\n```",
