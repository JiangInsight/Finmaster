                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract three specific line items from the given financial statements:\n\n1. **Taxes Payable (Balance Sheet)**: This represents the amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid.\n2. **Total Revenue (Income Statement)**: This represents the total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities.\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (Cash Flow Statement)**: This represents the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's principal revenue-producing activities and other activities that are not investing or financing activities.\n\nLet's extract these values step by step from the provided financial statements.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Taxes Payable from the Balance Sheet\nIn the Balance Sheet, we look for the line item \"Taxes Payable\" under the \"Account\" column. The corresponding \"End_amount\" is the value we need.\n- **Taxes Payable**: 1143833.89\n\n### Step 2: Extract Total Revenue from the Income Statement\nIn the Income Statement, we look for the line item \"Total Revenue\" under the \"Account\" column. The corresponding \"Amount\" is the value we need.\n- **Total Revenue**: 22876677.56\n\n### Step 3: Extract Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities from the Cash Flow Statement\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, we look for the line item \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" under the \"Account\" column. The corresponding \"Amount\" is the value we need.\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -16772398.72\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, we compile these values into the required JSON format, maintaining the order of the financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1143833.89', 'value2': '22876677.56', 'value3': '-16772398.72'}}\n```",
