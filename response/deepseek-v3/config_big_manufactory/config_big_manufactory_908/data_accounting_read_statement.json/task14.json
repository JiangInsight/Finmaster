These are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually within one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Liabilities\" represents the sum of all such liabilities.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `3143833.89` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify Line Items**:\n   - The current liabilities include \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\", which are summed up under \"Total Current Liabilities\". \n   - The initial value of \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00`, and the end value is `3143833.89`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3143833.89'}}\n```",
