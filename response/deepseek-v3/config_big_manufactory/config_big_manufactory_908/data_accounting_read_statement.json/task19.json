                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to identify and extract the four specific line items from the given balance sheet based on the task description. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to identify four specific line items from the balance sheet:\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This typically refers to \"Interest Receivable.\"\n2. **Accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is \"Accumulated Depreciation.\"\n3. **Tax payable**: This is straightforward as \"Taxes Payable.\"\n4. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is usually labeled as \"Paid-in Capital.\"\n\nFor each of these, we'll extract the initial amount and the end amount from the provided balance sheet.\n\n### Identifying the Line Items\nLet's go through the balance sheet and find these items:\n\n1. **Interest Receivable**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 13240.11\n\n2. **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 120631.67\n\n3. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 1143833.89\n\n4. **Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Initial_amount: 28000000.00\n   - End_amount: 28000000.00\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe task mentions maintaining the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the balance sheet, the order is:\n1. Interest Receivable\n2. Accumulated Depreciation\n3. Taxes Payable\n4. Paid-in Capital\n\nThis matches the order in which we've listed them above.\n\n### Formatting the Solution\nNow, we'll assign these to the 'initial value' and 'end valu' fields in order:\n- initial value1: Interest Receivable initial\n- end valu1: Interest Receivable end\n- initial value2: Accumulated Depreciation initial\n- end valu2: Accumulated Depreciation end\n- initial value3: Taxes Payable initial\n- end valu3: Taxes Payable end\n- initial value4: Paid-in Capital initial\n- end valu4: Paid-in Capital end\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '13240.11', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '120631.67', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '1143833.89', 'initial value4': '28000000.00', 'end valu4': '28000000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary:\n1. **Interest Receivable**:\n   - Found in the balance sheet with initial amount 0.00 and end amount 13240.11.\n   - Assigned to initial value1 and end valu1.\n\n2. **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Found with initial amount 0.00 and end amount 120631.67.\n   - Assigned to initial value2 and end valu2.\n\n3. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - Found with initial amount 0.00 and end amount 1143833.89.\n   - Assigned to initial value3 and end valu3.\n\n4. **Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Found with initial amount 28000000.00 and end amount 28000000.00.\n   - Assigned to initial value4 and end valu4.\n\nThis matches the example's structure and correctly identifies and orders the required line items.",
