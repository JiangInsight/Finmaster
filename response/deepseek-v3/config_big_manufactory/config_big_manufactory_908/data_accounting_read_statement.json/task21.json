In an income statement, this is typically represented by the revenue earned from the main business operations.\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: The line item that represents income from core operating activities is usually labeled as \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Operating Revenue\" or similar. In the given problem, the line item is clearly labeled as \"Main Business Revenue\".\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Main Business Revenue\" is the amount of income arising from the core operating activities. In the given problem, this value is \"22876677.56\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '22876677.56'}}\n```",
