These items are typically classified under \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents tangible items held for use in production, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial amount for \"Fixed Assets\" is listed as \"8000000.00\" with the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end amount for \"Fixed Assets\" is listed as \"10729032.26\" with the end date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n4. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is listed separately, but the \"Fixed Assets\" value already reflects the net value after depreciation (since the \"Total Non-current Assets\" is calculated as \"Fixed Assets\" minus \"Accumulated Depreciation\"). Therefore, we can directly use the \"Fixed Assets\" value.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10729032.26'} }\n```",
