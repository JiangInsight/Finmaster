In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit\".\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\nFrom the given problem, we can locate these two line items and their corresponding amounts:\n\n- **Net Profit**: 1938987.47\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 2729032.26\n\nThese values should be extracted in the order they appear in the statement. \n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1938987.47', 'value2': '2729032.26'} }\n```",
