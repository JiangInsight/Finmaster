                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break down the task to understand what each of the four values we need to extract represents, and then locate them in the given income statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract four specific line items from the income statement based on their descriptions:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to expenses related to selling the products or services. In accounting terms, this is commonly known as \"Selling Expenses.\"\n\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: These are the costs associated with borrowing money or other financing activities. This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expense.\"\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is the depreciation expense, which spreads the cost of an asset over its useful life. It's simply called \"Depreciation\" in the income statement.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is the tax expense or benefit for the period, labeled as \"Tax Expense.\"\n\n### Locating the Items in the Given Income Statement\n\nNow, let's look at the provided income statement and find these items:\n\nHere's the income statement for reference:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 22876677.56 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 22876677.56 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 16400000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost | 16400000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit | 6476677.56 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 1192395.86 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Selling Expenses** | **1461486.34** | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Depreciation** | **120631.67** | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Financial Expenses** | **632582.44** | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses | 3407096.31 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income | 13240.11 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 3082821.36 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Tax Expense** | **1143833.89** | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit | 1938987.47 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nFrom this, we can map the items as follows:\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: 1461486.34\n2. **Depreciation**: 120631.67\n3. **Financial Expenses**: 632582.44\n4. **Tax Expense**: 1143833.89\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe task mentions that for multiple outputs, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the order in the income statement:\n\n- Selling Expenses appears first among these four.\n- Then Depreciation.\n- Followed by Financial Expenses.\n- And finally, Tax Expense is towards the end.\n\nSo, the order is correct as is.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1461486.34', 'value2': '120631.67', 'value3': '632582.44', 'value4': '1143833.89'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the four required line items** based on their descriptions:\n   - Selling Expenses (costs to secure/deliver orders)\n   - Depreciation (asset allocation)\n   - Financial Expenses (financing costs)\n   - Tax Expense (taxes for the period)\n\n2. **Locate these items** in the provided income statement by matching the account names.\n\n3. **Extract the corresponding amounts**:\n   - Selling Expenses: 1461486.34\n   - Depreciation: 120631.67\n   - Financial Expenses: 632582.44\n   - Tax Expense: 1143833.89\n\n4. **Ensure the order** matches their appearance in the statement.\n\n5. **Format the answer** as specified in the JSON structure.\n\nThis method ensures that we accurately identify and extract the correct values in the right order.",
