This is typically listed under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Payable\" represents the amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is the item we need to extract.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, locate the \"Accounts Payable\" row.\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Accounts Payable\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Payable\" is `2000000.00` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify the Data**:\n   - Ensure that \"Accounts Payable\" is the correct line item for amounts owed on credit. This is confirmed by standard accounting practices.\n   - The initial and end values are clearly provided in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2000000.00'} }\n```",
