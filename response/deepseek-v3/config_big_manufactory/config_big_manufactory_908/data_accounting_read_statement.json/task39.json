A negative value indicates an increase in inventory (which is a use of cash), and a positive value would indicate a decrease in inventory (which is a source of cash). \n\nLooking at the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" has a value of \"-6600000.00\". This means there was an increase in inventory, which corresponds to a reduction in cash flow.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Locate the line item related to inventory changes in the cash flow statement.\n2. Identify the value associated with this line item.\n3. The value is \"-6600000.00\", which represents the reduction in cash flow due to an increase in inventory.\n\nThe solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-6600000.00'} }\n```",
