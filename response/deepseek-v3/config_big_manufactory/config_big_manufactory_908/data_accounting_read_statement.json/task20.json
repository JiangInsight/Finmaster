In accounting terms, this is typically represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item in the income statement. COGS represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n\n2. **Review the Income Statement**: Looking at the provided income statement, we can see the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with an amount of \"16400000.00\" dated \"2024-02-05\". \n\n3. **Verify the Line Item**: The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the correct line item to represent the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period. There are no other line items that would better represent this value (e.g., \"Total Cost\" is the same as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in this case, but \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the more specific and standard term for this purpose).\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"16400000.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '16400000.00'} }\n```",
