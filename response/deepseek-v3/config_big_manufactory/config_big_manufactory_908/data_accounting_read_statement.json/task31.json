                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe're given an income statement (a financial statement that shows a company's revenues and expenses over a specific period, leading to the net profit or loss). The task is to:\n\n1. **Identify and extract the specific line item and value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense.**\n   - This is commonly known as \"Profit Before Tax\" or \"Income Before Taxes.\"\n\n2. **Decompose this item into 4 component sub-items, all of which must also originate from the input statement.**\n   - This means we need to find how \"Profit Before Tax\" is calculated by breaking it down into four parts that are present in the given income statement.\n\n3. **For each sub-item, output its initial and final values.**\n   - This seems a bit unclear, but based on the example, it looks like we're just listing the values of the four sub-items that contribute to the \"Profit Before Tax.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Given Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- **Profit Before Tax**: -1373590.51\n- **Sub-items**:\n  1. sub_item value1: 5431018.59 (Total Revenue)\n  2. sub_item value2: 4410000.00 (Total Cost)\n  3. sub_item value3: 2397281.97 (Total Expenses)\n  4. sub_item value4: 2672.87 (Interest Income)\n\nFrom this, it seems the \"Profit Before Tax\" is calculated as:\n(Total Revenue - Total Cost) - Total Expenses + Interest Income\n\nBut let's verify:\n(5431018.59 - 4410000.00) = 1021018.59 (Gross Profit)\n1021018.59 - 2397281.97 = -1376263.38\n-1376263.38 + 2672.87 = -1373590.51 (matches Profit Before Tax)\n\nSo, the decomposition is:\n1. Total Revenue\n2. Total Cost\n3. Total Expenses\n4. Interest Income\n\n### Applying This to the New Problem\n\nNow, let's look at the new income statement provided:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 22876677.56 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 22876677.56 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 16400000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost | 16400000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit | 6476677.56 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 1192395.86 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Selling Expenses | 1461486.34 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation | 120631.67 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses | 632582.44 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses | 3407096.31 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income | 13240.11 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 3082821.36 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense | 1143833.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit | 1938987.47 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n**Step 1: Identify Profit Before Tax**\n- Clearly, \"Profit Before Tax\" is given as 3082821.36.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose Profit Before Tax into 4 sub-items**\nFollowing the same pattern as the example:\n1. Total Revenue\n2. Total Cost\n3. Total Expenses\n4. Interest Income\n\nLet's pick these from the table:\n1. Total Revenue: 22876677.56\n2. Total Cost: 16400000.00\n3. Total Expenses: 3407096.31\n4. Interest Income: 13240.11\n\n**Verification:**\n(Total Revenue - Total Cost) - Total Expenses + Interest Income\n= (22876677.56 - 16400000.00) - 3407096.31 + 13240.11\n= 6476677.56 - 3407096.31 + 13240.11\n= (6476677.56 - 3407096.31) = 3069581.25\n3069581.25 + 13240.11 = 3082821.36 (matches Profit Before Tax)\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on this, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3082821.36', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '22876677.56', 'sub_item value2': '16400000.00', 'sub_item value3': '3407096.31', 'sub_item value4': '13240.11'}}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the required output format in the instruction, it seems the 'sub_items' should be directly under 'solution' without a nested dictionary. The example shows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1373590.51', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '5431018.59', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '4410000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value3': '2397281.97', 'sub_items_sub_item value4': '2672.87'} }\n```\n\nSo, adjusting to match exactly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3082821.36', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '22876677.56', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '16400000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value3': '3407096.31', 'sub_items_sub_item value4': '13240.11'} }\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the structure and verifying the calculations, the correct decomposition of \"Profit Before Tax\" into its four sub-items is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3082821.36', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '22876677.56', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '16400000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value3': '3407096.31', 'sub_items_sub_item value4': '13240.11'} }\n```",
