In the given problem, we can see a line item labeled \"Tax Expense\".\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with the \"Tax Expense\" line item is the amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period. In this case, the value is \"1143833.89\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1143833.89'}}\n```",
