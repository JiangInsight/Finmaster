These represent the liquid assets that the entity can readily use for operational purposes.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant line items**:\n   - \"Cash on Hand\": This is physical cash available to the entity.\n   - \"Bank Deposits\": These are funds held in bank accounts that can be accessed for daily operations.\n\n2. **Extract the initial and end values**:\n   - For \"Cash on Hand\":\n     - Initial value: 5,000,000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End value: 627,601.28 (as of 2024-02-05)\n   - For \"Bank Deposits\":\n     - Initial value: 15,000,000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End value: -129,032.26 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Combine the values**:\n   - Initial total cash: 5,000,000.00 (Cash on Hand) + 15,000,000.00 (Bank Deposits) = 20,000,000.00\n   - End total cash: 627,601.28 (Cash on Hand) + (-129,032.26) (Bank Deposits) = 498,569.02\n\nHowever, the example provided in the task only included the \"Cash on Hand\" values in the solution, not the combined total. Following the example's format, we will only include the \"Cash on Hand\" values.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '627601.28'} }\n```",
