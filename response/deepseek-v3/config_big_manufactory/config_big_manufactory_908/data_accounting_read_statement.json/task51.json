This account represents interest that has been earned but not yet received. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: In the balance sheet, the \"Interest Receivable\" account has an \"Initial_amount\" of 0.00 as of the \"Initial_date\" 2023-12-31.\n2. **End Value**: The \"End_amount\" for \"Interest Receivable\" is 13240.11 as of the \"End_date\" 2024-02-05.\n\nThus, the initial value is '0.00' and the end value is '13240.11'.\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '13240.11'} }\n```",
