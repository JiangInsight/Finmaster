In the given problem, it is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the amount \"22876677.56\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item, which represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. In the given problem, it is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the amount \"16400000.00\".\n\nThe order of the values in the solution should match the order of the line items as they appear in the income statement. \n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Locate \"Main Business Revenue\" in the income statement and note its amount: \"22876677.56\".\n2. Locate \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement and note its amount: \"16400000.00\".\n3. Assign these values to 'value1' and 'value2' respectively, maintaining the original order.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '22876677.56', 'value2': '16400000.00'}}\n```",
