This confirms that the \"Beginning Balance\" is indeed the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is \"20000000.00.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20000000.00'}}\n```",
