                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific pieces of information from the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This typically refers to the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" because accounts payable represent amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n   \n2. **Acquisition of property, plant, and equipment**: This is usually listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement under investing activities.\n   \n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: This is the \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Cash Flow Statement\nLet's look at the given cash flow statement and locate these items.\n\n#### 1. Increase in Accounts Payable\nLooking under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities,\" we see:\n- Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 2000000.00\n\nThis is the amount by which accounts payable have increased during the period, indicating more goods or services were purchased on credit.\n\n#### 2. Purchase of Fixed Assets\nUnder \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" we find:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2729032.26\n\nThis represents the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment during the period.\n\n#### 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents at Beginning of Period\nUnder \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" we see:\n- Beginning Balance: 20000000.00\n\nThis is the cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the example provided:\n- 'value1' was \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": 1590000.00\n- 'value2' was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": 305354.43\n- 'value3' was \"Beginning Balance\": 8000000.00\n\nThis confirms our understanding of which line items correspond to which values.\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling the values from the problem we're solving:\n\n1. Increase in Accounts Payable: 2000000.00\n2. Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2729032.26\n3. Beginning Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents: 20000000.00\n\nSo, the solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2000000.00', 'value2': '2729032.26', 'value3': '20000000.00'} }\n```",
