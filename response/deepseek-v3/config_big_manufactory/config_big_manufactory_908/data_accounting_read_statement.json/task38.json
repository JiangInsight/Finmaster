                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task asks for the value that shows the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit. This is captured by the change in \"Accounts Receivable\" in the cash flow statement. A decrease in accounts receivable means that the entity has collected more cash from its customers than the sales made on credit during the period.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-15362611.64.\" A negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., less cash collected than sales on credit), but the absolute value represents the change in amounts owed. Since the task asks for the \"decrease,\" we interpret the value as given (even though it's negative, it represents the change in the context of the cash flow statement).\n4. **Verify the Context**: The line item is correctly identified as it directly relates to amounts owed for goods or services sold on credit (accounts receivable).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-15362611.64'}}\n```",
