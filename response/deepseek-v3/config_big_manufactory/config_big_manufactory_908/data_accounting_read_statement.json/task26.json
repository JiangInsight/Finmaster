In an income statement, these costs are usually listed under \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expenses.\"\n2. **Reviewing the Income Statement**: Looking at the provided income statement, we can see a line item labeled \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of \"632582.44\" dated \"2024-02-05.\"\n3. **Verification**: This line item is the most relevant as it directly represents the costs associated with raising funds (e.g., interest on debt). Other line items like \"Administrative Expenses\" or \"Selling Expenses\" are not related to financing costs.\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of financing costs is \"632582.44.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '632582.44'}}\n```",
