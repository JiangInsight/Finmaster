                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement extraction task step by step. I'm going to break down the problem to understand what we're being asked to find and then locate those items in the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under equity items like \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Common Stock.\"\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable,\" which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under operating activities.\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each financial statement one by one.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we're interested in the capital contributed by shareholders. The relevant line is:\n\n- **Paid-in Capital**: Initial_amount = 28,000,000.00, End_amount = 28,000,000.00\n\nThis suggests that there was no additional capital contributed during the period since the initial and end amounts are the same. However, the task asks for the capital contributed, which is the amount shareholders have put in, so we'll take the \"Paid-in Capital\" value.\n\n**Value1**: '28000000.00'\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNext, we need the profit or loss before tax. In the Income Statement, this is clearly labeled:\n\n- **Profit Before Tax**: 3,082,821.36\n\n**Value2**: '3082821.36'\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, the addition in the amount owed for goods/services on credit is the increase in Accounts Payable. In the Cash Flow Statement, under operating activities, we see:\n\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: 2,000,000.00\n\nThis represents the increase in what the company owes to its suppliers (i.e., the addition to Accounts Payable during the period).\n\n**Value3**: '2000000.00'\n\n### Verifying the Values\n\nLet's double-check each value to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Paid-in Capital**: The Balance Sheet shows both initial and end amounts as 28,000,000.00, indicating no change, but the total capital is indeed 28,000,000.00.\n2. **Profit Before Tax**: Directly from the Income Statement as 3,082,821.36.\n3. **Increase in Accounts Payable**: Directly from the Cash Flow Statement as 2,000,000.00.\n\nAll values seem correctly identified.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining these, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '3082821.36', 'value3': '2000000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Balance Sheet (Capital contributed by shareholders)**:\n   - Located \"Paid-in Capital\" with an end amount of 28,000,000.00.\n   - **Value1**: '28000000.00'\n\n2. **Income Statement (Profit before tax)**:\n   - Located \"Profit Before Tax\" as 3,082,821.36.\n   - **Value2**: '3082821.36'\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement (Increase in Accounts Payable)**:\n   - Located \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" as 2,000,000.00.\n   - **Value3**: '2000000.00'\n\nThus, the final JSON output is as above.",
