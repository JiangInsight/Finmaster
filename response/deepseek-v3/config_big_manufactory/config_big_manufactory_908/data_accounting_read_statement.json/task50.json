                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's recap what we're looking for based on the task description:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This usually corresponds to the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\".\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is generally the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents at the bottom of the statement.\n\nNow, let's find these in the provided cash flow statement.\n\n### Identifying the Line Items\n\nHere's the cash flow statement we're working with:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 1938987.47 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 120631.67 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -15362611.64 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -13240.11 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -6600000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 2000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 1143833.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -16772398.72 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 2729032.26 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -2729032.26 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 20000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 498569.02 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -19501430.98 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nNow, let's pick out the four items:\n\n1. **Depreciation**: Found as \"Depreciation\" with the amount `120631.67`.\n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: Found as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with the amount `-6600000.00`.\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: Found as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with the amount `-2729032.26`.\n4. **Net Increase**: Found as \"Net Increase\" with the amount `-19501430.98`.\n\n### Verifying the Items\n\nLet me double-check to ensure these are the correct matches:\n\n1. **Depreciation**: Yes, this is the systematic allocation of an asset's cost over its useful life.\n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: This represents changes in inventory, which are assets held for sale or in production.\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This includes purchases and sales of long-term assets and other investments.\n4. **Net Increase**: This is the net change in cash and cash equivalents for the period.\n\nAll seem correct based on the definitions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required JSON format, maintaining the order as per the task description (Depreciation, Inventory change, Investing cash flow, Net increase).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '120631.67', 'value2': '-6600000.00', 'value3': '-2729032.26', 'value4': '-19501430.98'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Depreciation**: Located the \"Depreciation\" line item → `120631.67`.\n2. **Inventory Change**: Located the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" line item → `-6600000.00`.\n3. **Investing Activities**: Located the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" line item → `-2729032.26`.\n4. **Net Increase in Cash**: Located the \"Net Increase\" line item → `-19501430.98`.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '120631.67', 'value2': '-6600000.00', 'value3': '-2729032.26', 'value4': '-19501430.98'} }\n```",
