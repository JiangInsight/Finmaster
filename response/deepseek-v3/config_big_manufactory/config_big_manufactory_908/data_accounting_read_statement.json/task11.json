This information is typically found under \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The balance sheet provided includes a line item called \"Retained Earnings,\" which represents the cumulative amount of profit or loss retained in the entity after any distributions to shareholders (e.g., dividends).\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Retained Earnings\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Retained Earnings\" is `1938987.47` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00`, indicating no retained earnings at the start of the period.\n   - The end value is `1938987.47`, indicating a positive retained earnings balance at the end of the period, which means the entity has retained profits during this period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1938987.47'} }\n```",
