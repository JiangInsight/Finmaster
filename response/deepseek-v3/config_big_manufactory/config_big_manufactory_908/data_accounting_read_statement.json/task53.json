This matches the requirement of the task.\n   - The value is clearly stated as \"16400000.00\" for the date \"2024-02-05.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is accurately represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" value in the income statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '16400000.00'}}\n```",
