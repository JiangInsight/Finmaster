However, since this is a negative value, it might indicate an overdraft or withdrawal rather than a deposit. But based on the task description, we are to extract the end value regardless of its sign.\n   - Therefore, `value1` is `-129032.26`.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - Look for the line item \"Interest Income\" in the Income Statement.\n   - The \"Amount\" for \"Interest Income\" is `13240.11`.\n   - Therefore, `value2` is `13240.11`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-129032.26', 'value2': '13240.11'}}\n```",
