                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we're interested in.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order to present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Accounts Receivable\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we have:\n```\nAccounts Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 15362611.64 | 2024-02-05\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" for Accounts Receivable is `15362611.64`. This is the amount owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Financial Expenses\nNow, checking the Income Statement:\n```\nFinancial Expenses | 632582.44 | 2024-02-05\n```\nHere, the amount for Financial Expenses is `632582.44`. This represents the financing costs incurred.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Purchase of Fixed Assets\nIn the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\nPurchase of Fixed Assets  | 2729032.26 | 2024-02-05\n```\nThe amount for Purchase of Fixed Assets is `2729032.26`. This is the cash paid to acquire long-term assets.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nJust to ensure, the order is:\n1. Balance Sheet (Accounts Receivable)\n2. Income Statement (Financial Expenses)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '15362611.64', 'value2': '632582.44', 'value3': '2729032.26'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Accounts Receivable (Balance Sheet)**:\n   - Located in the Balance Sheet under \"Accounts Receivable\".\n   - End amount: `15362611.64` → `value1`.\n\n2. **Financial Expenses (Income Statement)**:\n   - Found in the Income Statement as \"Financial Expenses\".\n   - Amount: `632582.44` → `value2`.\n\n3. **Purchase of Fixed Assets (Cash Flow Statement)**:\n   - Located in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n   - Amount: `2729032.26` → `value3`.\n\nThus, the correct extraction is as shown above.",
