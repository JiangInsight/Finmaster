Liabilities typically include accounts payable and any other unpaid obligations. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Liabilities:**\n   - The initial liabilities are the amounts that are unpaid at the beginning of the period. From the given data, there are no initial liabilities explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the initial liabilities are `0.00`.\n\n2. **Identify Transactions Contributing to Liabilities:**\n   - Liabilities can arise from unpaid purchases (accounts payable) and other unpaid obligations. \n   - In the given data, we need to look for transactions where the `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" and the `type` is \"Purchase\" or similar.\n\n3. **Calculate Final Liabilities:**\n   - From the transactions, the following purchases are marked as \"Unpaid\":\n     - `Purchase20231231007`: Amount = 1,000,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231013`: Amount = 1,000,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n   - The total unpaid purchases (accounts payable) = 1,000,000.0 + 1,000,000.0 = 2,000,000.0.\n   - There are no other unpaid obligations (like unpaid expenses or interest) that contribute to liabilities in this dataset.\n\n4. **Final Liabilities:**\n   - The final liabilities are the sum of all unpaid amounts at the end of the period, which is `2,000,000.00`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '2000000.00'}}\n```",
