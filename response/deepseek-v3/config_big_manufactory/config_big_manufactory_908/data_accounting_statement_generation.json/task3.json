Here's how we can approach it:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Inventory Value\nFrom the given data, there is no initial inventory value explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we can assume the initial inventory value is `0.00`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Purchases\nWe need to sum up all the purchase transactions where the type is \"Purchase\". Here are the relevant transactions:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 2,000,000.0 (2 units of Heavy Equipment C)\n2. Purchase20231231002: 1,500,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment D)\n3. Purchase20231231003: 1,600,000.0 (2 units of Heavy Equipment B)\n4. Purchase20231231004: 500,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment A)\n5. Purchase20231231005: 1,000,000.0 (2 units of Heavy Equipment A)\n6. Purchase20231231006: 1,500,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment D)\n7. Purchase20231231007: 1,000,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment C, unpaid)\n8. Purchase20231231008: 1,000,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment C)\n9. Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment C)\n10. Purchase20231231010: 800,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment B)\n11. Purchase20231231011: 1,600,000.0 (2 units of Heavy Equipment B)\n12. Purchase20231231012: 500,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment A)\n13. Purchase20231231013: 1,000,000.0 (2 units of Heavy Equipment A, unpaid)\n14. Purchase20231231014: 2,000,000.0 (2 units of Heavy Equipment C)\n15. Purchase20231231015: 1,500,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment D)\n16. Purchase20231231016: 1,500,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment D)\n17. Purchase20231231017: 3,000,000.0 (2 units of Heavy Equipment D)\n\nTotal Purchases = 2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,600,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,600,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 = 22,000,000.0\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Sales\nWe need to sum up the cost amounts from all sales transactions (since the cost amount represents the inventory value of the sold items). Here are the relevant transactions:\n\n1. Sale20240103002: 1,000,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment C)\n2. Sale20240108007: 1,000,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment C)\n3.

Sale20240120023: 500,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment A)\n10. Sale20240122024: 1,000,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment C)\n11. Sale20240123026: 500,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment A)\n12. Sale20240125027: 1,500,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment D)\n13. Sale20240128030: 1,500,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment D)\n14. Sale20240130032: 1,000,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment C)\n15.

Sale20240205041: 1,000,000.0 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment C)\n\nTotal Sales Cost = 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 = 16,800,000.0\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Inventory End Value\nThe inventory end value is calculated as:\nInventory End Value = Initial Inventory + Total Purchases - Total Sales Cost\nInventory End Value = 0.00 + 22,000,000.0 - 16,800,000.0 = 5,200,000.0\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"5200000.00\"}}\n```",
