These represent the amounts that have been recorded as expenses but not yet paid, thus affecting the accounts payable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Purchases with Account Payable:**\n   - Look for transactions where:\n     - `type` is \"Purchase\"\n     - `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\"\n     - `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\"\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Transactions:**\n   - From the given data, the following transactions meet the criteria:\n     - `Purchase20231231007`: Amount = 1,000,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231013`: Amount = 1,000,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n\n3. **Calculate Total Increase in Accounts Payable:**\n   - Sum the amounts of the identified transactions:\n     - 1,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231007) + 1,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231013) = 2,000,000.0\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The total increase in accounts payable is 2,000,000.00. Since this is an increase, it is represented as a positive value in the cash flow statement.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '2000000.00'}}\n```",
