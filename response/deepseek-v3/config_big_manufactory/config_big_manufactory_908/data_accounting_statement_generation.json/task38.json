These transactions represent sales that have not yet been collected in cash, thus affecting the accounts receivable balance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Sales Transactions**:\n   - We need to look for all transactions where:\n     - `type` is \"Sale\"\n     - `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\"\n     - `receive_method` is \"Account Receivable\"\n\n2. **Sum the Amounts of These Transactions**:\n   - For each identified transaction, we'll sum the `amount` field to get the total increase in accounts receivable.\n\n3. **List of Unpaid Sales Transactions**:\n   - From the provided data, the unpaid sales transactions are:\n     - Sale20240103002: 1,302,111.59\n     - Sale20240108007: 1,460,946.33\n     - Sale20240109009: 1,489,365.79\n     - Sale20240115014: 674,738.01\n     - Sale20240117018: 1,124,652.91\n     - Sale20240118019: 1,166,055.78\n     - Sale20240119021: 1,150,635.95\n     - Sale20240122024: 1,499,323.77\n     - Sale20240202036: 2,063,873.27\n     - Sale20240204039: 2,002,579.13\n     - Sale20240205041: 1,428,329.11\n\n4. **Calculate Total Increase in Accounts Receivable**:\n   - Sum of all unpaid sales amounts:\n     - 1,302,111.59 + 1,460,946.33 + 1,489,365.79 + 674,738.01 + 1,124,652.91 + 1,166,055.78 + 1,150,635.95 + 1,499,323.77 + 2,063,873.27 + 2,002,579.13 + 1,428,329.11 = 13,372,500.64\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is the negative of the total unpaid sales (since an increase in accounts receivable is a use of cash in the cash flow statement):\n     - -13,372,500.64\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-13372500.64'}}\n```",
