In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit.\"\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFrom the given problem, we can locate these two line items and their corresponding amounts:\n\n- **Net Profit**: The value is `405999.64`.\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The value is `0.00`.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '405999.64', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```",
