                        "content": "### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task requires us to identify and extract two specific line items and their corresponding values from the provided financial statements:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" in the income statement, as these are costs associated with marketing, sales, and distribution activities aimed at securing orders and delivering products/services.\n\n2. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is usually found in the cash flow statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar line items related to investing activities.\n\nThe financial statements provided are grouped in the order of:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nWe need to maintain this order and extract the relevant line items as they appear in the original statements.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each financial statement to locate the required information.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet provides a snapshot of the company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time. However, the two line items we're interested in are not typically found here. They are more operational and cash flow related, so we'll likely find them in the income statement and cash flow statement.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\nThe income statement shows revenues, expenses, and profits over a period. Here's the relevant part:\n\n```plaintext\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 14542813.42 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 14542813.42 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 10400000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost | 10400000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit | 4142813.42 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 1416371.84 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Selling Expenses | 963185.37 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation | 91498.88 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses | 559176.01 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses | 3030232.10 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income | 20559.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 1133140.32 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense | 727140.68 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit | 405999.64 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nFrom this, the line item that matches \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers\" is **\"Selling Expenses\"**, which is **963,185.37**.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nThe cash flow statement shows the inflows and outflows of cash, categorized into operating, investing, and financing activities. Here's the relevant part:\n\n```plaintext\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 405999.64 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 91498.88 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -10221447.35 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -20559.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -8400000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 727140.68 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -17417367.15 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 20000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 2582632.85 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -17417367.15 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nHere, the line item for \"cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\" is **\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"**, which is **0.00** in this case.\n\n### Verifying the Line Items\n\n- **Selling Expenses (963,185.37)**: This is a standard category that includes costs related to sales and distribution, aligning with the first requirement.\n  \n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets (0.00)**: This directly represents cash outflows for acquiring long-term assets like property, plant, and equipment. In this instance, there were no such purchases during the period.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above analysis, the two required values are:\n\n1. Selling Expenses: 963185.37\n2. Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided in the task, the solution was presented as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '493854.67', 'value2': '305354.43'}}\n```\n\nThis suggests that 'value1' corresponds to \"Selling Expenses\" and 'value2' corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\". Following this pattern, our answer should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '963185.37', 'value2': '0.00'}}\n```\n\nBut wait, in the example, 'value1' was \"Selling Expenses\" (493854.67) and 'value2' was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" (305354.43). So, applying the same logic to our problem:\n\n- 'value1': Selling Expenses = 963185.37\n- 'value2': Purchase of Fixed Assets = 0.00\n\nThus, the correct JSON output is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '963185.37', 'value2': '0.00'}}\n```\n\nHowever, I notice that in the example, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" was a positive number (305354.43), and in our case, it's zero. This is acceptable as it reflects that no purchases were made in the given period.\n\n### Potential Missteps\n\nInitially, one might consider \"Administrative Expenses\" or \"Cost of Goods Sold\" for the first value, but these don't directly relate to securing orders or delivering goods/services. \"Selling Expenses\" is the correct category here.\n\nFor the second value, one might overlook that \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" could be zero, thinking that perhaps another line item might represent long-term asset acquisitions. However, in the cash flow statement provided, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is explicitly listed, and its value is zero, indicating no purchases were made.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully reviewing each financial statement and identifying the relevant line items, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '963185.37', 'value2': '0.00'}}\n```",
