These items are typically categorized under \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The balance sheet provided includes a line item labeled \"Fixed Assets,\" which represents tangible items used in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes.\n   - \"Fixed Assets\" is the relevant line item for this task.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is given as \"8000000.00\" under the \"Initial_amount\" column.\n   - The initial date is \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is given as \"8000000.00\" under the \"End_amount\" column.\n   - The end date is \"2024-02-05\".\n\n4. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item shows the depreciation of fixed assets over time.\n   - The initial value is \"0.00\", and the end value is \"91498.88\".\n   - However, the \"Fixed Assets\" line item does not reflect this depreciation directly in its end value, suggesting that the \"Fixed Assets\" value is reported gross (before depreciation).\n\n5. **Determine Net Fixed Assets**:\n   - If the task requires the net value (after depreciation), we would subtract the accumulated depreciation from the fixed assets.\n   - Net Fixed Assets = Fixed Assets - Accumulated Depreciation = 8000000.00 - 91498.88 = 7908501.12.\n   - However, the example provided in the task description does not adjust for depreciation, so we will use the gross value of \"Fixed Assets\" as the end value.\n\n6. **Final Decision**:\n   - Since the example solution used the gross value of \"Fixed Assets\" (ignoring depreciation), we will do the same here.\n   - Initial value: \"8000000.00\".\n   - End value: \"8000000.00\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
