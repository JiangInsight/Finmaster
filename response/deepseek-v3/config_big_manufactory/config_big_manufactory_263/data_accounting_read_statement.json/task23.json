In financial statements, income from financial assets is typically categorized under \"Interest Income\" or similar terms like \"Dividend Income\" or \"Investment Income.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the Given Income Statement**: \n   - The income statement provided has several line items, including \"Main Business Revenue,\" \"Total Revenue,\" \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" etc.\n   - The line item \"Interest Income\" is present with an amount of \"20559.00\" and is likely the income earned from financial assets (e.g., interest from loans, bonds, or other interest-bearing financial instruments).\n\n3. **Verify the Line Item**: \n   - \"Interest Income\" is a common category for income earned from financial assets. Other potential names could include \"Dividend Income\" or \"Investment Income,\" but these are not present in the statement.\n   - Since \"Interest Income\" is the only line item that fits the description of income from financial assets, it is the correct choice.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: \n   - The value associated with \"Interest Income\" is \"20559.00.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20559.00'}}\n```",
