This information is typically found under \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The balance sheet provided includes a line item called \"Retained Earnings,\" which represents the cumulative amount of profit or loss retained in the entity after any distributions to shareholders.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Retained Earnings\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Retained Earnings\" is `405999.64` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value of retained earnings is indeed `0.00`, indicating no retained earnings at the start of the period.\n   - The end value of retained earnings is `405999.64`, indicating a profit retained in the entity by the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '405999.64'} }\n```",
