This line item is typically labeled as \"Net Profit\" in the cash flow statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task asks for the profit retained after all expenses. This is the net profit, which is calculated after deducting all operating expenses, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization from the total revenue.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item labeled \"Net Profit\" directly represents this value.\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value corresponding to \"Net Profit\" is \"405999.64\" for the date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n### Solution:\nThe value of the net profit is \"405999.64\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '405999.64'} }\n```",
