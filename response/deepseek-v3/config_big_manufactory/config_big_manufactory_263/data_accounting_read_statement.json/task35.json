                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the four specific line items that match the descriptions given in the task. \n\n### Understanding the Task\nThe task asks us to identify and extract the values for four specific types of costs or expenses from the income statement:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses.\" These are costs associated with marketing, selling, and distributing products or services.\n   \n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expense.\" These are costs related to borrowing money, like interest on loans.\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is \"Depreciation.\" It's the allocation of the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is \"Tax Expense.\" It represents the income tax owed based on the taxable income.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\nNow, let's look at the provided income statement and find these line items.\n\nHere's the income statement for reference:\n\n| Account                 | Amount      | Date       |\n|-------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| Main Business Revenue   | 14542813.42 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue           | 14542813.42 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold      | 10400000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost              | 10400000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit            | 4142813.42  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 1416371.84  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Selling Expenses        | 963185.37   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation            | 91498.88    | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses      | 559176.01   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses          | 3030232.10  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income         | 20559.00    | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax       | 1133140.32  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense             | 727140.68   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit              | 405999.64   | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Matching the Line Items\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: This directly matches the first description. In the table, \"Selling Expenses\" is listed with an amount of `963185.37`.\n   \n2. **Depreciation**: This matches the third description about the allocation of an asset's cost over its useful life. In the table, \"Depreciation\" is `91498.88`.\n\n3. **Financial Expenses**: This matches the second description about financing costs. In the table, \"Financial Expenses\" is `559176.01`.\n\n4. **Tax Expense**: This matches the fourth description about taxes. In the table, \"Tax Expense\" is `727140.68`.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe task mentions that for multiple outputs, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the order in the table:\n\n- Selling Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Financial Expenses\n- Tax Expense\n\nThis is the order in which they appear in the table, so we'll list them in that sequence in our solution.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the above analysis, the values are:\n\n1. Selling Expenses: `963185.37`\n2. Depreciation: `91498.88`\n3. Financial Expenses: `559176.01`\n4. Tax Expense: `727140.68`\n\nSo, the JSON solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '963185.37', 'value2': '91498.88', 'value3': '559176.01', 'value4': '727140.68'} }\n```\n\n### Double-Checking\nJust to ensure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n- **Value1 (Selling Expenses)**: Correct, as it's the cost to secure orders and deliver goods.\n- **Value2 (Depreciation)**: Correct, matches the description of asset allocation.\n- **Value3 (Financial Expenses)**: Correct, these are the financing costs.\n- **Value4 (Tax Expense)**: Correct, this is the tax amount.\n\nThe order also matches the sequence in the table. Everything checks out!\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully going through each description and matching it with the corresponding line item in the income statement, the correct values in order are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '963185.37', 'value2': '91498.88', 'value3': '559176.01', 'value4': '727140.68'} }\n```",
