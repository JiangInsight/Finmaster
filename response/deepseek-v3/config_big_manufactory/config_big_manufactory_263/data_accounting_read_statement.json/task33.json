The two line items we are interested in are:\n\n1. **Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities**: This is typically represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or similar line items that reflect the primary revenue-generating activities of the entity.\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or similar line items that reflect the cost associated with the inventory sold during the period.\n\nFrom the given income statement, we can see the following relevant line items:\n- \"Main Business Revenue\" with an amount of \"14542813.42\"\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with an amount of \"10400000.00\"\n\nThese are the two line items we need to extract, maintaining the original order as they appear in the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **Identify the line item for core operating activities income**: \"Main Business Revenue\" is the first relevant line item, with the value \"14542813.42\".\n2. **Identify the line item for carrying amount of inventories sold**: \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the next relevant line item, with the value \"10400000.00\".\n3. **Extract the values in the original order**: The first value is \"14542813.42\" (Main Business Revenue), and the second value is \"10400000.00\" (Cost of Goods Sold).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14542813.42', 'value2': '10400000.00'}}\n```",
