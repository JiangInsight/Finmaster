                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break down the task to understand what each of the four values we need to extract represents, and then locate them in the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract four specific line items from the cash flow statement based on their descriptions. Here's how I interpret each one:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is commonly known as **Depreciation**. It's the method by which a company allocates the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life.\n\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This refers to changes in **Inventory**. An increase in inventory would mean cash is being used to buy more inventory (a cash outflow), and a decrease would mean inventory is being sold (a cash inflow).\n\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**. It includes cash spent on or received from buying or selling long-term assets like property, plant, and equipment, as well as investments.\n\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the **Net Increase (or decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents** for the period. It shows the overall change in cash position from the beginning to the end of the period.\n\n### Locating the Values in the Given Statement\n\nNow, let's go through the provided cash flow statement to find these items.\n\n1. **Depreciation**:\n   - Looking at the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, there's a line item called \"Depreciation\" with an amount of `91498.88`.\n\n2. **Change in Inventory**:\n   - In the same section, there's \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with an amount of `-8400000.00`. \n   - The negative sign indicates an increase in inventory (since it's an outflow), which aligns with the description of a reduction in assets held for sale.\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - Under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", there's \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with an amount of `-0.00`. \n   - Even though it's `-0.00`, it's the value representing the net cash flow from investing activities.\n\n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, there's \"Net Increase\" with an amount of `-17417367.15`.\n   - This shows the net decrease in cash over the period.\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe task mentions that for multiple outputs, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the order in the statement:\n\n1. Depreciation appears first among our four items.\n2. Then, (Increase) Decrease in Inventory.\n3. Next is Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\n4. Finally, Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents.\n\nThis matches the order in which we've identified them.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above, the four values are:\n\n1. `value1` (Depreciation): `91498.88`\n2. `value2` (Change in Inventory): `-8400000.00`\n3. `value3` (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities): `-0.00`\n4. `value4` (Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents): `-17417367.15`\n\nHere's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91498.88', 'value2': '-8400000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-17417367.15'} }\n```",
