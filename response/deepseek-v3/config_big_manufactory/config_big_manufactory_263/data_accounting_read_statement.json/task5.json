These assets are typically categorized under \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents assets held for sale or in production is \"Inventory\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Inventory\" is listed as \"0.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Inventory\" is listed as \"8400000.00\" on the end date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n4. **Verify**:\n   - The initial and end values for \"Inventory\" are clearly provided in the balance sheet. No other line items (e.g., \"Accounts Receivable\", \"Fixed Assets\") fit the description of assets held for sale or in production.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '8400000.00'} }\n```",
