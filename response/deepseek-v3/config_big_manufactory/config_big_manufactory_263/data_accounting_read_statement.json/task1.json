This typically includes \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" as these are the most liquid assets that can be readily used for daily operations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The balance sheet includes \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" which are the primary components of cash available for day-to-day operations.\n   - Other items like \"Interest Receivable\", \"Accounts Receivable\", and \"Inventory\" are not considered as cash available for immediate use.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Values**:\n   - \"Cash on Hand\" initial amount: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - \"Bank Deposits\" initial amount: 15000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - Total initial cash = 5000000.00 + 15000000.00 = 20000000.00\n\n3. **Extract End Values**:\n   - \"Cash on Hand\" end amount: 1482632.85 (as of 2024-02-05)\n   - \"Bank Deposits\" end amount: 1100000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n   - Total end cash = 1482632.85 + 1100000.00 = 2582632.85\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value of cash available for day-to-day operations is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" initial amounts.\n   - The end value of cash available for day-to-day operations is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" end amounts.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '20000000.00', 'end value': '2582632.85'} }\n```",
