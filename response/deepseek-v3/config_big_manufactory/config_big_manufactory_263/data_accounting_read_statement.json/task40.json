This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item in the cash flow statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the value that shows the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services purchased on credit. This is directly related to the \"Accounts Payable\" line in the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is present under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is `0.00`. This indicates that there was no increase or decrease in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services purchased on credit during the period.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The value `0.00` makes sense in the context of the cash flow statement, as it shows no change in accounts payable during the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
