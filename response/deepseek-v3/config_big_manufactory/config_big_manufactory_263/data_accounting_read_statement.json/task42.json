This is typically found under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section of the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section includes the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is the standard label for cash payments to acquire PP&E and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `0.00` in the given problem. This indicates that there were no cash payments made for acquiring PP&E or other long-term assets during the period.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is also `-0.00`, which aligns with the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" being `0.00`. This consistency confirms that the correct value has been identified.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'}}\n```",
