The value we need is the \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\".\n\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is typically found in the **Income Statement** under \"Financial Expenses\". The value we need is the \"Amount\" for \"Financial Expenses\".\n\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is typically found in the **Cash Flow Statement** under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\". The value we need is the \"Amount\" for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\nLet's extract these values step by step from the given financial statements.\n\n### Step 1: Extract \"Accounts Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet\n- In the Balance Sheet, look for the line item \"Accounts Receivable\".\n- The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is `10221447.35`.\n\n### Step 2: Extract \"Financial Expenses\" from the Income Statement\n- In the Income Statement, look for the line item \"Financial Expenses\".\n- The \"Amount\" for \"Financial Expenses\" is `559176.01`.\n\n### Step 3: Extract \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" from the Cash Flow Statement\n- In the Cash Flow Statement, look for the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n- The \"Amount\" for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `0.00`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10221447.35', 'value2': '559176.01', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```",
