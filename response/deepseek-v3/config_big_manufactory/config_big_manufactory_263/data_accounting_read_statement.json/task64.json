I'm going to approach this methodically to ensure I extract the correct line items as specified in the task description.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the provided financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" during the period, which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\nThe order of extraction is important: Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each financial statement one by one.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we're interested in the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item, which represents the capital contributed by shareholders.\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 28000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 28000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe end amount is `28000000.00`. This is our first value (`value1`).\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNext, we look at the Income Statement for \"Profit Before Tax\".\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n```\nProfit Before Tax | 1133140.32 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe amount is `1133140.32`. This is our second value (`value2`).\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, we need the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" during the period. This is found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe amount is `0.00`. This is our third value (`value3`).\n\n### Verifying the Values\n\nLet's double-check each to ensure accuracy:\n\n1. **Paid-in Capital**: Confirmed as `28000000.00` in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Profit Before Tax**: Confirmed as `1133140.32` in the Income Statement.\n3. **Increase in Accounts Payable**: Confirmed as `0.00` in the Cash Flow Statement. This means there was no increase in accounts payable during the period.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '1133140.32', 'value3': '0.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the three required line items**:\n   - Capital contributed by shareholders: \"Paid-in Capital\" in Balance Sheet.\n   - Profit before tax: \"Profit Before Tax\" in Income Statement.\n   - Increase in accounts payable: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" in Cash Flow Statement.\n\n2. **Locate each in the respective financial statements**:\n   - Balance Sheet: `Paid-in Capital` → `28000000.00`.\n   - Income Statement: `Profit Before Tax` → `1133140.32`.\n   - Cash Flow Statement: `Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable` → `0.00`.\n\n3. **Order them as per the instructions**:\n   - Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n4. **Construct the JSON output** with the extracted values.\n\nThis method ensures that we accurately extract the required information from the correct sections of the financial statements.",
