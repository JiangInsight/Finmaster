In an income statement, this is usually represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Operating Revenue.\"\n2. **Analyze the Given Income Statement**: \n   - The income statement provided includes a line item labeled \"Main Business Revenue\" with an amount of \"14542813.42\".\n   - This line item clearly represents the income from the entity's core operating activities.\n3. **Exclude Non-Operating Income**: \n   - Other income items like \"Interest Income\" are not part of core operating activities and should be excluded.\n4. **Extract the Value**: \n   - The value to be extracted is the amount associated with \"Main Business Revenue,\" which is \"14542813.42\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '14542813.42'} }\n```",
