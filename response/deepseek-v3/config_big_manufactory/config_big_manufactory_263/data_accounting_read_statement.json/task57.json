This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is typically recorded under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet or cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Check the Balance Sheet**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, the \"Accounts Payable\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00\n     - End_amount: 0.00\n   - This indicates there was no change in \"Accounts Payable\" during the period.\n\n3. **Check the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" shows:\n     - Amount: 0.00\n   - This confirms that there was no increase or decrease in the amount owed for goods or services on credit during the period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both the balance sheet and cash flow statement show no change in \"Accounts Payable,\" the value of the addition in the amount owed is 0.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'}}\n```",
