COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n\n2. **Review the Given Income Statement**: The income statement provided includes a line item labeled \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with an amount of \"10400000.00\" dated \"2024-02-05.\"\n\n3. **Verify the Line Item**: The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the correct line item to represent the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period. No other line item in the statement matches this description.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"10400000.00.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '10400000.00'} }\n```",
