These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually one year). In the given balance sheet, the non-current assets are represented by \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" and their total is given under \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is provided under \"Total Non-current Assets\" with the \"Initial_amount\" of \"8000000.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" \"2023-12-31.\"\n   - The end value of non-current assets is provided under \"Total Non-current Assets\" with the \"End_amount\" of \"7908501.12\" as of the \"End_date\" \"2024-02-05.\"\n\n3. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value is confirmed by the \"Total Non-current Assets\" line, which shows \"8000000.00\" initially.\n   - The end value is confirmed by the \"Total Non-current Assets\" line, which shows \"7908501.12\" at the end date. This is calculated as the \"Fixed Assets\" end value (\"8000000.00\") minus the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" end value (\"91498.88\"), resulting in \"8000000.00 - 91498.88 = 7908501.12.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7908501.12'}}\n```",
