These are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities Line Items**: \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under liabilities are \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\". Both of these are typically settled within the operating cycle and are part of \"Current Liabilities\".\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" line summarizes all such liabilities.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The \"Total Current Liabilities\" at the initial date (2023-12-31) is `0.00`.\n   - **End Value**: The \"Total Current Liabilities\" at the end date (2024-02-05) is `727140.68`.\n\n3. **Verify Other Liabilities**:\n   - There are no other line items under liabilities (e.g., long-term liabilities) in this balance sheet, so the total current liabilities are the only liabilities expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '727140.68'} }\n```",
