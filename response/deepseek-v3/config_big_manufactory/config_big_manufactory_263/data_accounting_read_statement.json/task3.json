This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the amounts owed by customers for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet. This is the standard account that tracks amounts owed to the entity for credit sales.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" and \"Initial_date\" columns provide the starting value and date for the \"Accounts Receivable\" account.\n   - The \"End_amount\" and \"End_date\" columns provide the ending value and date for the \"Accounts Receivable\" account.\n\n3. **Locate the Values in the Given Problem**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 10221447.35 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n4. **Prepare the Solution**:\n   - The initial value is '0.00'.\n   - The end value is '10221447.35'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '10221447.35'} }\n```",
