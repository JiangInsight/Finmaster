In an income statement, these are usually listed under \"Financial Expenses\" or similar terms.\n2. **Analyzing the Given Income Statement**: Looking at the provided income statement, we can see a line item labeled \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of \"559176.01\".\n3. **Verification**: This line item is the most relevant to financing costs as it directly pertains to the costs associated with raising funds (e.g., interest payments).\n4. **Exclusion of Other Items**: Other line items like \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Selling Expenses\", or \"Depreciation\" are not related to financing costs. \"Interest Income\" is related to earnings from investments, not costs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe value of the financing costs is the amount listed under \"Financial Expenses\", which is \"559176.01\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '559176.01'}}\n```",
