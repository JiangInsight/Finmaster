                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to look at the income statement provided and identify the three specific line items we need to extract:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This typically refers to the total revenue generated from the main business operations. In the income statement, this is usually labeled as \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue.\" \n\n   - In the given statement, we have both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" with the same amount, which is `14542813.42`. Since \"Total Revenue\" is a more encompassing term, it's likely the one we should pick. But looking at the example, they used \"Main Business Revenue,\" so I'll go with that to be consistent.\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold during the period. In accounting terms, this is commonly referred to as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n   - In the statement, we see \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the amount `10400000.00`.\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the expenses related to the general administration and management of the company. This is usually labeled as \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\n   - In the statement, \"Administrative Expenses\" is listed with the amount `1416371.84`.\n\nNow, let's map these to the required values:\n\n- `value1`: Total income from ordinary activities → \"Main Business Revenue\" → `14542813.42`\n- `value2`: Carrying amount of inventories sold → \"Cost of Goods Sold\" → `10400000.00`\n- `value3`: Costs of general management and administration → \"Administrative Expenses\" → `1416371.84`\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14542813.42', 'value2': '10400000.00', 'value3': '1416371.84'} }\n```",
