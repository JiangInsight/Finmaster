These are typically the current assets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all current assets.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial value of total current assets is given as \"20000000.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n   - **End Value**: The end value of total current assets is given as \"21224639.20\" on the end date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Exclude Non-Current Assets**: Non-current assets (like fixed assets) are not expected to be realized or consumed within the normal operating cycle, so they are not included in the solution.\n\n4. **Verify**: The \"Total Current Assets\" line item includes all assets that are expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle, such as cash, bank deposits, accounts receivable, and inventory.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '20000000.00', 'end value': '21224639.20'} }\n```",
