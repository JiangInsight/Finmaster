In the given problem, it's listed as \"Total Revenue\" with an amount of \"14542813.42\".\n   - **Total Cost**: This is the total cost associated with generating the revenue. In the given problem, it's listed as \"Total Cost\" with an amount of \"10400000.00\".\n\n2. **Find the Difference Between Revenue and Cost**:\n   - The difference between revenue and cost is typically referred to as \"Gross Profit\" in an income statement. This is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost}\n     \\]\n   - In the given problem, \"Gross Profit\" is explicitly listed with an amount of \"4142813.42\", which matches the calculation:\n     \\[\n     14542813.42 - 10400000.00 = 4142813.42\n     \\]\n\n3. **Extract the Value**:\n   - The value we are interested in is the \"Gross Profit\", which is \"4142813.42\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '4142813.42'}}\n```",
