I'm going to break it down to understand what we're being asked to do and then extract the necessary information from the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the cash flow statement along with their corresponding values. These line items are:\n\n1. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This typically refers to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" because accounts payable represent amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n   \n2. **Acquisition of property, plant and equipment**: This is usually listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement.\n   \n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: This is the \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\nThe order of these values in the output should match the order they appear in the input statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement and locate these items.\n\n#### 1. Increase in Accounts Payable\nLooking under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities,\" we see:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": The amount here is `0.00`.\n\n#### 2. Purchase of Fixed Assets\nUnder \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" we find:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": The amount is `0.00`.\n\n#### 3. Beginning Cash Balance\nUnder \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" we see:\n- \"Beginning Balance\": The amount is `20000000.00`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n- The first value was from \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" (`1590000.00`).\n- The second was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" (`305354.43`).\n- The third was \"Beginning Balance\" (`8000000.00`).\n\nThis confirms our understanding of which line items correspond to which values.\n\n### Extracting the Values\n\nNow, let's extract the values from the problem statement:\n\n1. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: `0.00`\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: `0.00`\n3. **Beginning Balance**: `20000000.00`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '0.00', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '20000000.00'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the line items**:\n   - Amount owed for goods/services on credit → \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\"\n   - Acquisition of property, plant, equipment → \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"\n   - Cash at beginning → \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\"\n\n2. **Locate in the statement**:\n   - Accounts Payable: `0.00`\n   - Fixed Assets Purchase: `0.00`\n   - Beginning Cash: `20000000.00`\n\n3. **Order as per input**:\n   - The order in the statement is: Accounts Payable, then Fixed Assets, then Beginning Balance.\n\n4. **Construct the JSON**:\n   - Map to 'value1', 'value2', 'value3' respectively.\n\nThus, the solution is correctly represented as above.",
