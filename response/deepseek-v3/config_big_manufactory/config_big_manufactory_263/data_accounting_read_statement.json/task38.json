This is typically reflected in the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item in the cash flow statement under the \"Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the cash flow statement provided, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is the one that reflects changes in amounts owed to the entity. \n\n3. **Interpret the Value**: \n   - A negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (meaning more amounts are owed to the entity, which is a cash outflow).\n   - A positive value would indicate a decrease in accounts receivable (meaning amounts owed to the entity have been paid, which is a cash inflow).\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: In the given problem, the value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is \"-10221447.35\". This negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable, not a decrease. However, the task specifically asks for the \"decrease in amounts owed,\" so if the value were positive, it would represent a decrease. Since the value is negative, it represents an increase, not a decrease. \n\n   - **Clarification**: The task might be asking for the absolute value of the change in accounts receivable, regardless of whether it's an increase or decrease. But based on the example provided, the solution extracted the value as it appears (even if it's negative). \n\n5. **Final Answer**: Following the example, we extract the value as it appears in the line item, which is \"-10221447.35\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-10221447.35'}}\n```",
