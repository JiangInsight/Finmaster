Accounts payable represents the amounts owed to suppliers for purchases made on credit (i.e., unpaid purchases).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Accounts Payable:**\n   - The initial accounts payable is the amount owed to suppliers at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31). \n   - From the given data, there are no unpaid purchases recorded on 2023-12-31. All purchases on this date are marked as \"Paid\" in the `payment/receipt_status` column.\n   - Therefore, the initial accounts payable is **0.00**.\n\n2. **Identify Final Accounts Payable:**\n   - The final accounts payable is the amount owed to suppliers at the end of the period (after considering all transactions).\n   - We need to look for purchases where the `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\". \n   - From the data, there are no unpaid purchases recorded during the period. All purchases are marked as \"Paid\".\n   - Therefore, the final accounts payable is also **0.00**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '0.00'} }\n```",
