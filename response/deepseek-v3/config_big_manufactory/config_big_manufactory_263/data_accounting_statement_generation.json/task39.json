The interest receivable transactions are identified by the \"type\" field being \"Interest Receivables\". \n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify all Interest Receivables transactions**: We'll go through each transaction and pick out those where the type is \"Interest Receivables\".\n\n2. **Sum the amounts**: We'll sum the \"amount\" or \"recorded_amount\" (they are the same in this case) for all these transactions.\n\n3. **Calculate the net change**: The cash flow statement typically shows the net change in interest receivable, which is the sum of all interest receivable amounts. If the sum is positive, it indicates an increase in interest receivable; if negative, a decrease.\n\nLet's extract and sum all the interest receivable amounts:\n\nFrom the data provided, the interest receivable transactions are as follows (only showing the amount for brevity):\n\n- 1335.0\n- 1335.0\n- 1246.0\n- 1246.0\n- 1246.0\n- 1068.0\n- 1068.0\n- 801.0\n- 729.8\n- 729.8\n- 729.8\n- 729.8\n- 729.8\n- 729.8\n- 685.3\n- 418.29999999999995\n- 418.29999999999995\n- 418.29999999999995\n- 418.29999999999995\n- 418.29999999999995\n- 418.29999999999995\n- 418.29999999999995\n- 418.29999999999995\n- 418.29999999999995\n- 418.29999999999995\n- 275.9\n- 275.9\n- 275.9\n- 275.9\n- 186.89999999999998\n- 186.89999999999998\n- 97.89999999999999\n- 97.89999999999999\n- 97.89999999999999\n- 97.89999999999999\n- 97.89999999999999\n\nNow, let's sum these amounts:\n\nCalculating the sum:\n1335.0 + 1335.0 = 2670.0  \n2670.0 + 1246.0 = 3916.0  \n3916.0 + 1246.0 = 5162.0  \n5162.0 + 1246.0 = 6408.0  \n6408.0 + 1068.0 = 7476.0  \n7476.0 + 1068.0 = 8544.0  \n8544.0 + 801.0 = 9345.0  \n9345.0 + 729.8 = 10074.8  \n10074.8 + 729.8 = 10804.6  \n10804.6 + 729.8 = 11534.4  \n11534.4 + 729.8 = 12264.2  \n12264.2 + 729.8 = 12994.0  \n12994.0 + 729.8 = 13723.8  \n13723.8 + 729.8 = 14453.6  \n14453.6 + 685.3 = 15138.9  \n15138.9 + 418.3 = 15557.2  \n15557.2 + 418.3 = 15975.5  \n15975.5 + 418.3 = 16393.8  \n16393.8 + 418.3 = 16812.1  \n16812.1 + 418.3 = 17230.4  \n17230.4 + 418.3 = 17648.7  \n17648.7 + 418.3 = 18067.0  \n18067.0 + 418.3 = 18485.3  \n18485.3 + 418.3 = 18903.6  \n18903.6 + 418.3 = 19321.9  \n19321.9 + 275.9 = 19597.8  \n19597.8 + 275.9 = 19873.7  \n19873.7 + 275.9 = 20149.6  \n20149.6 + 275.9 = 20425.5  \n20425.5 + 186.9 = 20612.4  \n20612.4 + 186.9 = 20799.3  \n20799.3 + 97.9 = 20897.2  \n20897.2 + 97.9 = 20995.1  \n20995.1 + 97.9 = 21093.0  \n21093.0 + 97.9 = 21190.9  \n21190.9 + 97.9 = 21288.8\n\nThe total sum of interest receivable is **21288.8**.\n\nIn the cash flow statement, the \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" would be the negative of this sum (since an increase in receivables is a use of cash, and a decrease is a source of cash). \n\nThus, the final value is **-21288.8**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-21288.8'}}\n```",
