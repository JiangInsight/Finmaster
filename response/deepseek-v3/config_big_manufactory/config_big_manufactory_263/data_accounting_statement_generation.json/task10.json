                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the initial and final values of non-current assets (property, plant, and equipment) based on the provided transactions data. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Non-current Assets\nFrom the transactions data, the initial non-current assets are recorded under the \"Fixed Assets\" type with the date \"2023-12-31\". \n\n- **Initial Fixed Assets**: 8,000,000.00\n\n### Step 2: Identify Additions to Non-current Assets\nAdditions to non-current assets come from purchases of heavy equipment (P001, P002, P003, P004) which are capitalized as fixed assets. These are recorded under the \"Purchase\" type with the date \"2023-12-31\" or later, but we only consider purchases in the initial period (2023-12-31) for the initial value. \n\nFrom the data, the following purchases are relevant for additions to non-current assets:\n1. Purchase20231231001: Heavy Equipment B (P002) - 800,000.00\n2. Purchase20231231002: Heavy Equipment A (P001) - 500,000.00\n3. Purchase20231231003: Heavy Equipment A (P001) - 1,000,000.00\n4. Purchase20231231004: Heavy Equipment B (P002) - 800,000.00\n5. Purchase20231231005: Heavy Equipment C (P003) - 2,000,000.00\n6. Purchase20231231006: Heavy Equipment D (P004) - 3,000,000.00\n7. Purchase20231231007: Heavy Equipment B (P002) - 800,000.00\n8. Purchase20231231008: Heavy Equipment C (P003) - 2,000,000.00\n9. Purchase20231231009: Heavy Equipment A (P001) - 500,000.00\n10. Purchase20231231010: Heavy Equipment D (P004) - 3,000,000.00\n11. Purchase20231231011: Heavy Equipment B (P002) - 800,000.00\n12. Purchase20231231012: Heavy Equipment B (P002) - 1,600,000.00\n13. Purchase20231231013: Heavy Equipment C (P003) - 2,000,000.00\n\nTotal additions to non-current assets: \n800,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 2,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 800,000 + 2,000,000 + 500,000 + 3,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,600,000 + 2,000,000 = 18,800,000.00\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Initial Non-current Assets\nThe initial non-current assets are the sum of the initial fixed assets and the additions from purchases:\nInitial Non-current Assets = Initial Fixed Assets + Additions\n= 8,000,000.00 + 18,800,000.00 = 26,800,000.00\n\n### Step 4: Identify Depreciation\nDepreciation reduces the value of non-current assets over time. From the data, there are two depreciation entries:\n1. Depreciation20240101001: 45,750.46\n2. Depreciation20240201002: 45,748.42\n\nTotal depreciation: 45,750.46 + 45,748.42 = 91,498.88\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Final Non-current Assets\nFinal Non-current Assets = Initial Non-current Assets - Total Depreciation\n= 26,800,000.00 - 91,498.88 = 26,708,501.12\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Non-current Assets Initial Value\": \"26800000.00\", \"Total Non-current Assets End Value\": \"26708501.12\"}}\n```",
