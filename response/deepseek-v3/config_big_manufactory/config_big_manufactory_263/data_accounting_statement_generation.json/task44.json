Fixed assets are typically recorded under transactions with the type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar. \n\nFrom the given data, we can see that the transactions related to the purchase of fixed assets are those where the type is \"Purchase\" and the product name indicates heavy equipment (e.g., \"Heavy Equipment A\", \"Heavy Equipment B\", etc.). These are capital expenditures and should be included in the purchase of fixed assets.\n\nHere are the relevant transactions:\n1. Purchase20231231001: 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B)\n2. Purchase20231231002: 500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A)\n3. Purchase20231231003: 1,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A)\n4. Purchase20231231004: 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B)\n5. Purchase20231231005: 2,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C)\n6. Purchase20231231006: 3,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D)\n7. Purchase20231231007: 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B)\n8. Purchase20231231008: 2,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C)\n9. Purchase20231231009: 500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A)\n10. Purchase20231231010: 3,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D)\n11. Purchase20231231011: 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B)\n12. Purchase20231231012: 1,600,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B)\n13. Purchase20231231013: 2,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C)\n\nNow, we sum all these amounts to get the total purchase of fixed assets:\n800,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 2,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 800,000 + 2,000,000 + 500,000 + 3,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,600,000 + 2,000,000 = 18,800,000.0\n\nThus, the final purchase of fixed assets is 18,800,000.0.\n\nThe solution is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '18800000.0'}}\n```",
