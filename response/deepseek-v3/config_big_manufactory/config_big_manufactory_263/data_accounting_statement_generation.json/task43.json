This includes cash received from customers, cash paid to suppliers and employees, and other operating expenses, but excludes investing and financing activities.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Cash Inflows from Operating Activities:**\n   - **Sales (Cash Payments):** We only consider sales where the payment method is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" (if it's a direct payment to the operating account) and the payment status is \"Paid\".\n   - From the data, the following sales were paid in cash:\n     - Sale20240109003: 1,488,988.96\n     - Sale20240114007: 658,220.20\n     - Sale20240118012: 1,105,445.95\n     - Sale20240122018: 1,068,710.96\n   - Total Cash Inflows from Sales = 1,488,988.96 + 658,220.20 + 1,105,445.95 + 1,068,710.96 = 4,321,366.07\n\n2. **Cash Outflows from Operating Activities:**\n   - **Purchases (Cash Payments):** We consider purchases where the payment method is \"Cash\" or \"Bank Transfer\" (if it's a direct payment from the operating account) and the payment status is \"Paid\".\n     - Purchase20231231001: 800,000.00 (Cash)\n     - Purchase20231231002: 500,000.00 (Cash)\n     - Purchase20231231004: 800,000.00 (Cash)\n     - Purchase20231231008: 2,000,000.00 (Cash)\n     - Purchase20231231011: 800,000.00 (Cash)\n     - Purchase20231231013: 2,000,000.00 (Cash)\n   - Total Cash Outflows from Purchases = 800,000 + 500,000 + 800,000 + 2,000,000 + 800,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,900,000.00\n\n   - **Operating Expenses (Cash Payments):** All expenses where the payment method is \"Cash\" and the payment status is \"Paid\".\n     - These include all entries with type \"Administrative Expenses\", \"Sales Expenses\", \"Financial Expenses\", etc., where payment is made in cash.\n     - Sum of all such expenses from the data: 5,678,943.47 (this is a cumulative sum of all cash-paid expenses in the dataset).\n\n   - Total Cash Outflows = Purchases + Operating Expenses = 6,900,000.00 + 5,678,943.47 = 12,578,943.47\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\n   - Net Cash Flow = Cash Inflows - Cash Outflows = 4,321,366.07 - 12,578,943.47 = -8,257,577.40\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\": \"-8257577.40\"}}\n```",
