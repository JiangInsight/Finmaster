This is because the cash flow statement reflects actual cash movements, and only taxes from paid sales transactions would have been paid or received in cash.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify all sales transactions**: Look for rows where the \"type\" is \"Sale\".\n2. **Filter for paid sales**: From these sales transactions, filter those where \"payment/receipt_status\" is \"Paid\".\n3. **Sum the tax amounts**: For these paid sales, sum the values in the \"tax_amount\" column.\n\n### Applying to the Given Data:\n\nFrom the problem data, the sales transactions with \"Paid\" status and their tax amounts are:\n\n1. Sale20240109003: tax_amount = 74449.45\n2. Sale20240114007: tax_amount = 32911.01\n3. Sale20240118012: tax_amount = 55272.30\n4. Sale20240122018: tax_amount = 53435.55\n5. Sale20240119014: tax_amount = 110026.52 (This is \"Unpaid\", so exclude)\n6. Sale20240120015: tax_amount = 74895.86 (This is \"Unpaid\", so exclude)\n7. Sale20240125020: tax_amount = 66408.56 (This is \"Unpaid\", so exclude)\n\nOnly the first four sales are \"Paid\". \n\nNow, sum their tax amounts:\n74449.45 (Sale20240109003) +\n32911.01 (Sale20240114007) +\n55272.30 (Sale20240118012) +\n53435.55 (Sale20240122018) = 216068.31\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '216068.31'}}\n```",
