I'm going to calculate the ending balance of cash and cash equivalents based on the transactions provided. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe have a list of transactions with various types like initial deposits, purchases, expenses, sales, etc. Our goal is to track how the cash and cash equivalents change over time based on these transactions.\n\n### Initial Balances\nFrom the data, we have initial deposits:\n1. Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0\n2. Bank deposit: 15,000,000.0\n   - Total initial cash and cash equivalents: 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 = 20,000,000.0\n\n### Transactions Affecting Cash\nWe need to consider transactions that either increase or decrease cash and cash equivalents. These are:\n- **Cash inflows**: Sales where payment is received in cash, bank transfers to cash.\n- **Cash outflows**: Purchases or expenses paid in cash, cash transfers to bank.\n\nWe'll ignore transactions that don't affect cash directly, like unpaid sales, unpaid purchases, depreciation, interest receivables (unless paid), etc.\n\n### Processing Transactions\nLet's go through each relevant transaction and adjust the cash balance accordingly.\n\n#### Initial Cash Balance: 20,000,000.0\n\n1. **Purchase20231231001**: Purchase paid in cash -
