                        "content": "To calculate the final net cash flows from investing activities in the cash flow statement, we need to identify all transactions that fall under investing activities. Investing activities typically include:\n\n1. Purchase or sale of fixed assets (e.g., property, plant, equipment).\n2. Purchase or sale of investments (e.g., stocks, bonds).\n3. Loans made to others or collections on loans.\n\nFrom the given data, we can see that the relevant transactions are those involving the purchase of fixed assets or heavy equipment. Here are the relevant transactions:\n\n1. **Initial20231231001 | Fixed Assets | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 8000000.0 | 8000000.0**\n   - This is an initial fixed asset entry, which is not a cash flow transaction (it's likely a balance sheet entry). So, we can ignore this for cash flow purposes.\n\n2. **Purchase20231231001 | Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 800000.0 | 800000.0 | 800000.0 | Director | Senior Staff | Paid | Cash | S010 | Supplier 10 | P002 | Heavy Equipment B | 1.0 | 800000.0**\n   - This is a purchase of heavy equipment (fixed asset) paid in cash.
