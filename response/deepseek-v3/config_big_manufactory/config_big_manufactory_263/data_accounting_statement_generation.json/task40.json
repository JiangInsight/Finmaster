Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Purchase Transactions\nWe look for all transactions where the type is \"Purchase\". These represent inventory additions. From the data, the purchase transactions are:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: $800,000 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n2. Purchase20231231002: $500,000 (Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit)\n3. Purchase20231231003: $1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment A, 2 units)\n4. Purchase20231231004: $800,000 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n5. Purchase20231231005: $2,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C, 2 units)\n6. Purchase20231231006: $3,000,000 (Heavy Equipment D, 2 units)\n7. Purchase20231231007: $800,000 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n8. Purchase20231231008: $2,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C, 2 units)\n9. Purchase20231231009: $500,000 (Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit)\n10. Purchase20231231010: $3,000,000 (Heavy Equipment D, 2 units)\n11. Purchase20231231011: $800,000 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n12. Purchase20231231012: $1,600,000 (Heavy Equipment B, 2 units)\n13. Purchase20231231013: $2,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C, 2 units)\n\nTotal Purchases = $800,000 + $500,000 + $1,000,000 + $800,000 + $2,000,000 + $3,000,000 + $800,000 + $2,000,000 + $500,000 + $3,000,000 + $800,000 + $1,600,000 + $2,000,000 = **$18,800,000**\n\n### Step 2: Identify Sale Transactions\nWe look for all transactions where the type is \"Sale\". These represent inventory reductions. From the data, the sale transactions are:\n\n1. Sale20240104001: $800,000 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n2. Sale20240108002: $1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit)\n3. Sale20240109003: $1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit)\n4. Sale20240113005: $500,000 (Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit)\n5. Sale20240114007: $500,000 (Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit)\n6. Sale20240115009: $1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D, 1 unit)\n7. Sale20240118012: $800,000 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n8. Sale20240119014: $1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D, 1 unit)\n9. Sale20240120015: $1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit)\n10. Sale20240122018: $800,000 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n11. Sale20240125020: $1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit)\n\nTotal Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = $800,000 + $1,000,000 + $1,000,000 + $500,000 + $500,000 + $1,500,000 + $800,000 + $1,500,000 + $1,000,000 + $800,000 + $1,000,000 = **$10,400,000**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Inventory Change\nThe change in inventory is calculated as:\n- If purchases > COGS: Inventory increases (negative value in cash flow statement).\n- If COGS > purchases: Inventory decreases (positive value in cash flow statement).\n\nHere, purchases ($18,800,000) > COGS ($10,400,000), so inventory increases by:\n$18,800,000 - $10,400,000 = **$8,400,000**\n\nIn the cash flow statement, this is represented as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\". Since inventory increased, it is shown as a negative value (cash outflow).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-8400000.00'}}\n```",
