These transactions represent sales that have not yet been collected in cash and thus increase accounts receivable.\n\nLet's go through the data step by step:\n\n1. Identify all sales transactions with \"Unpaid\" status and \"Account Receviable\" method:\n   - Sale20240104001: $1,041,848.53\n   - Sale20240108002: $1,378,082.08\n   - Sale20240113005: $668,830.84\n   - Sale20240115009: $2,106,067.17\n   - Sale20240119014: $2,200,530.42\n   - Sale20240120015: $1,497,917.10\n   - Sale20240125020: $1,328,171.21\n\n2. Sum these amounts to get the total increase in accounts receivable:\n   $1,041,848.53 + $1,378,082.08 + $668,830.84 + $2,106,067.17 + $2,200,530.42 + $1,497,917.10 + $1,328,171.21 = $10,221,447.35\n\n3. Since this is an increase in accounts receivable, it should be shown as a negative number in the cash flow statement (as it represents cash not yet received).\n\n4. The final amount is -$10,221,447.35\n\nThe solution is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-10221447.35'}}\n```",
