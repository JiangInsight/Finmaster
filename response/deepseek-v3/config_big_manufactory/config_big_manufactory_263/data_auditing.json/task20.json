Looking at transaction \"Purchase20231231003\":\n   - The recorded_type is \"Sale\" but based on the invoice description and other fields, this should clearly be a \"Purchase\" transaction\n   - The recorded_unit_price is $406,790.41 but the invoice states the unit price should be $500,000\n   - The transaction ID starts with \"Purchase\" which further confirms it should be a purchase\n   - The payment_method is \"Bank Transfer\" which is typical for purchases, not sales\n   - The supplier information is present which is expected for purchases\n\n2. The risk_issues field also confirms these inconsistencies:\n   - Original category should be \"Purchase\" but was recorded as \"Sale\"\n   - Original price should be $500,000 but was recorded as $406,790.41\n\n3. Other fields appear consistent with a purchase transaction:\n   - Date, quantity, payment status, preparer and approver all match the invoice description\n   - No issues with tax, profit or receive_method since those aren't applicable to purchases\n\nHere's the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Purchase\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2023-12-31\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"Bank Transfer\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"Bank Transfer\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"2.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"2.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"500000.0\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"406790.41\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": \"1000000.0\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"1000000.0\",\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"Senior Staff\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Senior Staff\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"id\": \"Purchase20231231003\"\n}}\n```",
