This is because FCF represents the cash generated (or used) by the business after accounting for capital expenditures, and it should align with the net change in cash if there are no other financing activities or errors.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   The Free Cash Flow (FCF) is -17,417,367.15.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-17417367.15'}}\n```",
