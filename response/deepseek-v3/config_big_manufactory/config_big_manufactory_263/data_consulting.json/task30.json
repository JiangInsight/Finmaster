                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 21,224,639.20\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 727,140.68\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 21,224,639.20 / 727,140.68 ≈ 29.19\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 1,482,632.85\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 1,100,000.00\n- Interest Receivable (End_amount) = 20,559.00\n- Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 10,221,447.35\n- Total Quick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n  = 1,482,632.85 + 1,100,000.00 + 20,559.00 + 10,221,447.35 = 12,824,639.20\n- Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 12,824,639.20 / 727,140.68 ≈ 17.64\n\nWait a minute, usually the Quick Ratio excludes inventory from current assets, but it includes cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Here, \"Bank Deposits\" can be considered as cash equivalents, and \"Interest Receivable\" is a short-term receivable, so they're included. \n\nBut looking back, the Total Current Assets is 21,224,639.20, which includes inventory (8,400,000.00). So Quick Assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 21,224,639.20 - 8,400,000.00 = 12,824,639.20.\n\nSo Quick Ratio = 12,824,639.20 / 727,140.68 ≈ 17.64\n\nBut this seems unusually high compared to the Current Ratio. Maybe I should double-check what's included in Quick Assets.\n\nTypically, Quick Assets = Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable. Here:\n\n- Cash on Hand: 1,482,632.85\n- Bank Deposits: 1,100,000.00 (cash equivalents)\n- Interest Receivable: 20,559.00 (short-term receivable)\n- Accounts Receivable: 10,221,447.35\n\nTotal Quick Assets = 1,482,632.85 + 1,100,000.00 + 20,559.00 + 10,221,447.35 = 12,824,639.20\n\nSo the calculation seems correct. Maybe the numbers are just large.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 727,140.68\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 29,133,140.32\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 727,140.68 / 29,133,140.32 ≈ 0.025 or 2.5%\n\nBut looking at the balance sheet, under Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity, it sums to Total Assets, and the only liability is Total Current Liabilities. So this seems correct.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 727,140.68\n- Total Owner's Equity (End_amount) = 28,405,999.64\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 727,140.68 / 28,405,999.64 ≈ 0.0256 or 2.56%\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -17,417,367.15\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 727,140.68\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -17,417,367.15 / 727,140.68 ≈ -23.95\n\nThis is a very negative number, indicating that the operating cash flow is negative and significantly larger than the total debt.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '29.19', 'Quick Ratio': '17.64', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.025', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.0256', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-23.95'} }\n```\n\n**Reviewing the Numbers:**\nThe Current and Quick Ratios seem extremely high because the current liabilities are relatively small compared to the current assets. The company has a lot of current assets (especially receivables and inventory) and very little current debt, leading to these high ratios. \n\nThe Debt to Asset and Debt to Equity ratios are very low, indicating minimal debt relative to assets and equity. \n\nThe Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is negative because the operating cash flow is negative, which is a concern as it suggests the company isn't generating enough cash from operations to cover its (albeit small) debt.\n\nGiven the numbers, these calculations appear correct based on the provided financial statements.",
