                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step, explaining how I calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -17,417,367.15\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68\n\n**Calculation:**  \n-17,417,367.15 / 727,140.68 ≈ -23.95\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68 (this seems to be the only liability)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 28,405,999.64\n\nAssuming \"Total Debt\" is just the current liabilities (since no long-term debt is listed):\n727,140.68 / 28,405,999.64 ≈ 0.0256 or 0.03 (rounded)\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have considered all liabilities (which here is just current liabilities). So it's a very small ratio.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 14,542,813.42\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 28,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 29,133,140.32\n- Average Total Assets = (28,000,000 + 29,133,140.32) / 2 = 28,566,570.16\n\n**Calculation:**  \n14,542,813.42 / 28,566,570.16 ≈ 0.51\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 21,224,639.20\n- Inventory = 8,400,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 727,140.68\n\n**Calculation:**  \n(21,224,639.20 - 8,400,000) / 727,140.68 = 12,824,639.20 / 727,140.68 ≈ 17.64\n\nThis seems unusually high, but the numbers check out based on the given data.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the first ratio we calculated:\n-17,417,367.15 / 727,140.68 ≈ -23.95\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 405,999.64\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Equity = 28,000,000.00\n- End Equity = 28,405,999.64\n- Average Equity = (28,000,000 + 28,405,999.64) / 2 = 28,202,999.82\n\n**Calculation:**  \n405,999.64 / 28,202,999.82 ≈ 0.0144 or 1.44%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales):\n- Net Sales = 14,542,813.42\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 10,221,447.35\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 10,221,447.35) / 2 = 5,110,723.675\n\n**Calculation:**  \n14,542,813.42 / 5,110,723.675 ≈ 2.85\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-23.95', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.51', 'Quick Ratio': '17.64', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-23.95', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '1.44%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.85'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n- The quick ratio is very high because current assets (excluding inventory) are much larger than current liabilities.\n- The operating cash flow ratios are negative because the operating cash flow is negative.\n- ROE is positive but small because net income is small relative to equity.\n- Accounts receivable turnover is moderate, indicating receivables are being collected a few times over the period.\n\nEverything seems to align correctly with the given data.",
