                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This measures how much out of every dollar of sales a company retains as gross profit. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This shows a company's ability to cover its debts with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \"Total Debt\" is typically the sum of current and non-current liabilities. However, in the given balance sheet, we only have \"Total Current Liabilities\" and no non-current liabilities listed. So, we'll consider \"Total Current Liabilities\" as the total debt for this calculation.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Numbers\n\nFrom the **Income Statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$14,542,813.42\n- Gross Profit: \\$4,142,813.42\n\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$17,417,367.15\n\nFrom the **Balance Sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$727,140.68\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{4,142,813.42}{14,542,813.42} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{4,142,813.42}{14,542,813.42} \\approx 0.2849\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.2849 \\times 100 \\approx 28.49\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, Gross Profit Margin is approximately **28.49%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68} \\approx -23.95\n\\]\n\nSo, Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-23.95**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit / Revenue = 4,142,813.42 / 14,542,813.42 ≈ 0.2849 → 28.49%\n   - This seems correct.\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Operating Cash Flow is negative, which isn't great, meaning the company is burning cash from operations.\n   - Debt is relatively small compared to the cash outflow, leading to a large negative ratio.\n   - The calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '28.49%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-23.95'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- The negative Cash Flow to Debt Ratio indicates that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its debts, which could be a concern.\n- The Gross Profit Margin of ~28.5% seems healthy, meaning the company retains a good portion of revenue after accounting for the cost of goods sold. However, the negative operating cash flow suggests high operating expenses or issues with receivables/inventory management, as seen in the cash flow statement with significant increases in accounts receivable and inventory.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the calculation or interpretation?",
