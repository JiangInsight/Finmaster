                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio to understand how to compute them based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Liabilities:** This is the sum of all liabilities. In the given balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" we have:\n  - Taxes Payable: 727,140.68\n  - Accounts Payable: 0.00\n  - So, Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68\n  - There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68\n\n- **Total Assets:** Given as 29,133,140.32 at the end date.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{727,140.68}{29,133,140.32} \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{727,140.68}{29,133,140.32} \\approx 0.02496 \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.02\n\nWait a minute, but in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was 0.14, which seems higher. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" it's 727,140.68, and there are no other liabilities listed. So, unless there are other liabilities not listed here, the calculation seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the example to see how they got 0.14.\n\nIn the example:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Total Assets: 13,216,409.49\n- Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.1409 ≈ 0.14\n\nSo, my calculation method seems correct. Maybe in the current problem, the debt is indeed lower relative to assets.\n\nSo, our Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.02.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet shows only current liabilities under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" and nothing else under liabilities. So, it seems correct.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -17,417,367.15\n- Net Profit (Net Income): 405,999.64\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{405,999.64} \\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{405,999.64} \\approx -42.90 \\]\n\nHmm, this is a negative ratio, which seems unusual compared to the example where it was positive (4.41). \n\nIn the example:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSo, negative divided by negative is positive.\n\nIn our case, negative divided by positive is negative. \n\nIs this correct? \n\nLooking at the numbers:\n- Operating Cash Flow is negative, meaning the company had a net outflow from operations.\n- Net Income is positive, meaning the company was profitable on an accrual basis.\n\nThis suggests that even though the company reported a profit, it had significant cash outflows, possibly due to increases in working capital (like increases in accounts receivable and inventory).\n\nSo, the negative ratio seems correct based on the numbers.\n\nBut is this ratio usually positive? \n\nIn healthy companies, operating cash flow is positive and higher than net income (due to add-backs like depreciation), so the ratio is greater than 1. \n\nHere, operating cash flow is negative, and net income is positive, so the ratio is negative, indicating potential cash flow issues despite profitability.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter carefully calculating both ratios:\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio: ~0.02\n2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: ~-42.90\n\nHowever, the Debt to Asset Ratio seems quite low (0.02), which might be correct given the data, but let me verify if I missed any liabilities. \n\nLooking back, the balance sheet only shows Taxes Payable under current liabilities, and no other debts. So, total liabilities are indeed 727,140.68, making the ratio ~0.02.\n\nSimilarly, the operating cash flow to net income is indeed negative based on the numbers.\n\nBut in the example, the ratios were presented as strings with two decimal places, so I'll format similarly.\n\nSo, final ratios:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: '0.02'\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: '-42.90'\n\nBut the example had ratios like '0.14' and '4.41', which are positive. Maybe the negative sign is acceptable here since the numbers dictate it.\n\nAlternatively, is there a chance I misread the operating cash flow? \n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n\"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is -17,417,367.15\n\"Net Profit\" is 405,999.64\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct.\n\nPerhaps the negative ratio is correct in this context.\n\n### Final JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.02', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-42.90'} }\n```",
