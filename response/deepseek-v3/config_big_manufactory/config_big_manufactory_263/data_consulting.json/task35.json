                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount): 21,224,639.20\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 727,140.68\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 21,224,639.20 / 727,140.68 ≈ 29.19\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit: 4,142,813.42\n- Total Revenue: 14,542,813.42\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (4,142,813.42 / 14,542,813.42) * 100 ≈ 28.49%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities: Since only current liabilities are given (no long-term liabilities), we'll use Total Current Liabilities: 727,140.68\n- Total Assets: 29,133,140.32\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 727,140.68 / 29,133,140.32 ≈ 0.025 or 2.5%\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated using Total Current Liabilities as the debt, even though there might be other liabilities not listed. Here, it seems only current liabilities are present, so we'll proceed with that.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: 405,999.64\n- Total Revenue: 14,542,813.42\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (405,999.64 / 14,542,813.42) * 100 ≈ 2.79%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand: 1,482,632.85\n- Bank Deposits: 1,100,000.00\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents: 1,482,632.85 + 1,100,000.00 = 2,582,632.85\n- Current Liabilities: 727,140.68\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 2,582,632.85 / 727,140.68 ≈ 3.55\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -17,417,367.15\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -0.00\n- Free Cash Flow is typically calculated as Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures. Here, Purchase of Fixed Assets is 0, so FCF is essentially the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -17,417,367.15\n\nAlternatively, the example seems to use the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents as FCF, which is -17,417,367.15. So we'll go with that.\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: 405,999.64\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets (End_amount): 29,133,140.32\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (405,999.64 / 29,133,140.32) * 100 ≈ 1.39%\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '29.19', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.49%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.025', 'Net Profit Margin': '2.79%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '3.55', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-17417367.15', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '1.39%'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated differently. Maybe it's considering all liabilities (even if not explicitly listed). Here, since only current liabilities are present, the ratio is very low. If we consider that there might be no other liabilities, then 0.025 is correct. Alternatively, if we're supposed to consider only current liabilities as debt, then it's correct as is.\n\nSimilarly, the Current Ratio is very high because current assets are much larger than current liabilities. \n\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure no mistakes:\n\n- Current Ratio: 21,224,639.20 / 727,140.68 = 29.19 (correct)\n- Gross Profit Margin: 4,142,813.42 / 14,542,813.42 = 0.2849 → 28.49% (correct)\n- Debt to Asset: 727,140.68 / 29,133,140.32 ≈ 0.025 (correct, unless other liabilities are implied)\n- Net Profit Margin: 405,999.64 / 14,542,813.42 ≈ 0.0279 → 2.79% (correct)\n- Cash to Current Debt: (1,482,632.85 + 1,100,000) / 727,140.68 ≈ 3.55 (correct)\n- FCF: Net Increase is -17,417,367.15 (matches)\n- ROA: 405,999.64 / 29,133,140.32 ≈ 0.0139 → 1.39% (correct)\n\nEverything checks out. The Debt to Asset Ratio is indeed low because the company has very little debt relative to its assets. \n\nFinal JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '29.19', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.49%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.025', 'Net Profit Margin': '2.79%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '3.55', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-17417367.15', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '1.39%'}}\n```",
