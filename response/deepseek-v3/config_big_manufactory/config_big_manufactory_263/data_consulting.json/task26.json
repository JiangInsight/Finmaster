                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. I'll go through each one, explaining how to calculate them using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n**Definition:** ROE measures a company's profitability by showing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the **income statement**, the Net Profit is **405,999.64**.\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**, the Total Owner's Equity (Shareholder's Equity) at the end is **28,405,999.64**.\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{405,999.64}{28,405,999.64} \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{405,999.64}{28,405,999.64} \\approx 0.01429 \\]\n\\[ 0.01429 \\times 100 \\approx 1.429\\% \\]\n\nSo, ROE is approximately **1.43%**.\n\n### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- Total Liabilities: This is the Total Current Liabilities, which is **727,140.68** (since there are no non-current liabilities listed).\n- Total Assets at the end: **29,133,140.32**.\n\nNow, calculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{727,140.68}{29,133,140.32} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{727,140.68}{29,133,140.32} \\approx 0.02496 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately **0.025**.\n\n### 3. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS), indicating how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- Gross Profit: **4,142,813.42**\n- Total Revenue: **14,542,813.42**\n\nNow, calculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{4,142,813.42}{14,542,813.42} \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,142,813.42}{14,542,813.42} \\approx 0.2849 \\]\n\\[ 0.2849 \\times 100 \\approx 28.49\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **28.49%**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '1.43%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.025', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.49%'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the percentages were given with two decimal places, and the debt to asset ratio was also to two decimal places. So, to match that format:\n\n- ROE: 1.43%\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.02 (since 0.02496 rounds to 0.02)\n- Gross Profit Margin: 28.49%\n\nBut 0.02496 is closer to 0.025, which rounds to 0.03 if we're rounding to two decimal places, but the example had one decimal place for debt to asset ratio (0.14). Maybe it's to two decimal places as displayed, so 0.025 is fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example was one decimal for debt to asset, so 0.0 for ours, but that seems too low. Maybe it's better to keep two decimals for consistency.\n\nGiven that, I'll present it as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '1.43%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.025', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.49%'} }\n```\n\nBut if we're to follow the example's format where debt to asset was \"0.14\" (two decimals), then ours would be \"0.02\" or \"0.03\". 0.02496 is closer to 0.025, which is 0.03 when rounding to two decimals, but that seems high compared to the actual value. Maybe the example was not rounded, so we can present as is.\n\nGiven that, the most accurate is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '1.43%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.025', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.49%'} }\n```\n\nBut the example had '0.14', which is one decimal if we consider it as 0.14, not 0.140. Maybe it's to two decimal places as displayed. So, to match, we can present as:\n\nROE: 1.43%\nDebt to Asset: 0.02 (since 0.02496 is closer to 0.02 than 0.03 when rounding to two decimals)\nGross Profit Margin: 28.49%\n\nBut 0.02496 to two decimals is 0.02 (since the third digit is 4, which is less than 5).\n\nSo final:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '1.43%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.02', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.49%'} }\n```",
