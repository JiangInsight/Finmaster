These typically include:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - (Note: Inventory is excluded from quick assets because it is not as liquid.)\n\n2. **Identify Current Liabilities**: These are liabilities that are due within one year. In this case, it is \"Total Current Liabilities.\"\n\n3. **Calculate Quick Ratio**: The formula for the Quick Ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Quick Assets**:\n   - Cash on Hand: 1,482,632.85\n   - Bank Deposits: 1,100,000.00\n   - Interest Receivable: 20,559.00\n   - Accounts Receivable: 10,221,447.35\n   - **Total Quick Assets**: 1,482,632.85 + 1,100,000.00 + 20,559.00 + 10,221,447.35 = 12,824,639.20\n\n2. **Current Liabilities**: 727,140.68\n\n3. **Quick Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{12,824,639.20}{727,140.68} \\approx 17.64\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '17.64'} }\n```",
