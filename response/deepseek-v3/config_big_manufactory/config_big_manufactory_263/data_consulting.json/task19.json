                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate both the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Since we only have the ending inventory (no beginning inventory other than zero), we'll use the ending inventory as the average inventory for this calculation.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Assets (End_amount)**: 21,224,639.20\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount)**: 727,140.68\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 10,400,000.00\n- **Inventory (from balance sheet, End_amount)**: 8,400,000.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{21,224,639.20}{727,140.68}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{21,224,639.20}{727,140.68} \\approx 29.19\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems unusually high. Let me double-check the numbers.\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet:\n\n- Total Current Assets: 21,224,639.20\n- Total Current Liabilities: 727,140.68\n\nThe calculation seems correct numerically, but a current ratio of ~29 is extremely high, indicating that current assets are much larger than current liabilities. This might be unusual but based on the given data, that's the figure.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{10,400,000.00}{8,400,000.00}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10,400,000.00}{8,400,000.00} \\approx 1.24\n\\]\n\nAgain, checking the numbers:\n\n- COGS: 10,400,000.00\n- Inventory: 8,400,000.00\n\nThe calculation is correct.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Current Ratio was 4.27 with Current Assets ~7.96M and Current Liabilities ~1.86M.\n- Inventory Turnover was 1.73 with COGS ~4.41M and Inventory ~5.09M.\n\nOur calculations follow the same method, so the approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- **Current Ratio**: 21,224,639.20 / 727,140.68 ≈ 29.19\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: 10,400,000.00 / 8,400,000.00 ≈ 1.24\n\nHowever, the example's inventory turnover was calculated as COGS / Ending Inventory (since beginning was zero), so we'll do the same here.\n\nBut wait, in the example, beginning inventory was zero, and ending was 5,090,000, and they used COGS / ending inventory to get 1.73 (4.41 / 5.09 ≈ 0.866, which doesn't match their 1.73). Hmm, maybe they used COGS / average inventory where average is (beginning + ending)/2. But beginning is zero, so average is ending/2, so 4.41 / (5.09/2) = 4.41 / 2.545 ≈ 1.73. That makes sense.\n\nSo, for our case:\n\nBeginning inventory: 0\nEnding inventory: 8,400,000\nAverage inventory: (0 + 8,400,000) / 2 = 4,200,000\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory = 10,400,000 / 4,200,000 ≈ 2.48\n\nAh, I see my earlier mistake. I didn't average the inventory correctly when beginning was zero. Let's correct that.\n\nSo, correct Inventory Turnover Ratio is 10,400,000 / 4,200,000 ≈ 2.48\n\nSimilarly, in the example, they must have used average inventory (5,090,000 / 2 = 2,545,000), so 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73.\n\nTherefore, correcting our calculation:\n\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (0 + 8,400,000) / 2 = 4,200,000\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 10,400,000 / 4,200,000 ≈ 2.48\n\n### Final Correct Calculations\n\n1. **Current Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21,224,639.20}{727,140.68} \\approx 29.19\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10,400,000.00}{4,200,000.00} \\approx 2.48\n   \\]\n\nHowever, looking back at the balance sheet, the initial inventory was 0, and ending is 8,400,000, so average is 4,200,000. So, 10,400,000 / 4,200,000 = 2.476, which we can round to 2.48.\n\nBut in the example, they had:\n\nBeginning inventory: 0\nEnding inventory: 5,090,000\nCOGS: 4,410,000\nInventory Turnover: 4,410,000 / (5,090,000 / 2) = 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nSimilarly here:\n\nCOGS: 10,400,000\nAverage inventory: (0 + 8,400,000) / 2 = 4,200,000\nInventory Turnover: 10,400,000 / 4,200,000 ≈ 2.48\n\n### Final Answer in JSON\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '29.19', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '2.48'}}\n```\n\nHowever, the example had the Current Ratio rounded to two decimal places ('4.27'), so we might do the same here: '29.19' is already to two decimal places, and '2.48' is also to two decimal places.\n\nBut let's check the division more precisely for Current Ratio:\n\n21,224,639.20 / 727,140.68 ≈ 29.1897... so '29.19' is correct.\n\nSimilarly, 10,400,000 / 4,200,000 = 2.47619..., so '2.48' is correct when rounded.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '29.19', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '2.48'}}\n```",
