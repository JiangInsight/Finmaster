                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Asset Ratio\nFirst, I need to understand what the Debt to Asset Ratio is. From what I recall, it's a financial metric that shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nBut sometimes, \"Total Debt\" can be interpreted as \"Total Liabilities.\" In the context of a balance sheet, liabilities represent what the company owes, which is essentially its debt. So, I think in this case, we can consider \"Total Current Liabilities\" as the debt since that's what the company owes in the short term.\n\nLooking at the given balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" the end amount is 727,140.68. There doesn't seem to be any long-term liabilities listed, so that might be the total debt.\n\n### Identifying Total Assets\nNext, \"Total Assets\" is clearly given at the bottom of the assets section. The end amount for \"Total Assets\" is 29,133,140.32.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{727,140.68}{29,133,140.32} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{727,140.68}{29,133,140.32} \\approx 0.02496 \\]\n\nRounding this to two decimal places, it's approximately 0.02 or 0.025, but looking at the example provided, they seem to round to two decimal places as well, giving '0.14' in their solution. So, I'll present it similarly.\n\n### Verifying\nWait a minute, in the example, the \"Total Current Liabilities\" was 1,861,550.92, and \"Total Assets\" was 13,216,409.49, leading to a ratio of 0.14 (1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14). \n\nIn our case, the liabilities are much smaller relative to assets, so 0.02 seems correct. Maybe it's better to present it with more precision, like '0.025', but the example used two decimal places, so '0.02' might be acceptable. Alternatively, maybe they expect it to be expressed as a decimal rounded to two places, so '0.02'.\n\nBut looking at the numbers more carefully:\n\n727,140.68 / 29,133,140.32 ≈ 0.02496, which is closer to 0.025 when rounded to three decimal places. If we round to two decimal places, it's 0.02, but that seems a bit low. Maybe it's better to keep it as '0.025' for more accuracy.\n\nHowever, the example gave '0.14' which is two decimal places, so perhaps '0.02' is intended. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is sometimes expressed as a percentage, but the example shows it as a decimal, so probably not.\n\nGiven that, I think '0.02' is the most appropriate based on the example's format.\n\n### Final Calculation\nBut let me double-check the calculation:\n\n727,140.68 ÷ 29,133,140.32 ≈ 0.02496\n\nRounding 0.02496 to two decimal places is 0.02, since the third digit is 4, which is less than 5.\n\nSo, '0.02' seems correct.\n\n### Checking for Other Debts\nIs there any other debt not listed under current liabilities? The balance sheet shows:\n\n- Accounts Payable: 0.00\n- Taxes Payable: 727,140.68\n- Total Current Liabilities: 727,140.68\n\nNo long-term liabilities are listed, so total debt is indeed 727,140.68.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.02.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.02'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, their ratio was '0.14' when liabilities were about 14% of assets. Here, our liabilities are about 2.5% of assets, so '0.02' seems too low, maybe it's better to present '0.025'. \n\nBut the example used two decimal places, so perhaps they expect two decimal places, making it '0.02'. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is supposed to be calculated differently. Maybe \"Total Liabilities\" includes both current and non-current liabilities, but in this case, there are no non-current liabilities listed, so it's still just current liabilities.\n\nGiven that, I think '0.02' is correct based on the given data and the example's format.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.02'}}\n```\n\nBut to be more precise, since 727,140.68 / 29,133,140.32 = 0.02496, which is closer to 0.025, maybe it's better to present it as '0.025'. \n\nGiven that the example had '0.14' which is two decimal places, presenting '0.025' would be three, but it's more accurate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio is supposed to be 'Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity' over 'Total Assets', but that would always be 1, since they balance. \n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. \n\nGiven that, I think the most accurate is '0.025', but if following the example's two decimal places, '0.02'.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll go with '0.02' to match the example's format.\n\n**Final Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.02'}}\n```",
