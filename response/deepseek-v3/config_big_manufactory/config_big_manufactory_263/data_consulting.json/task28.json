                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We have three financial statements: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement. We need to calculate three ratios: Debt to Asset Ratio, Gross Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 727,140.68\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities:** Not provided explicitly, but looking at the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities.\" There's no separate line for long-term debt or non-current liabilities. So, we'll assume Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68.\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 29,133,140.32\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{727,140.68}{29,133,140.32} \\approx 0.02496 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.02 or 2%.\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as 0.14, which seems higher. Maybe I missed some liabilities. Looking back at the balance sheet:\n\nUnder \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity,\" it's 29,133,140.32, which matches Total Assets. The components are:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 727,140.68\n- Paid-in Capital: 28,000,000.00\n- Retained Earnings: 405,999.64\n- Total Owner's Equity: 28,405,999.64\n\nAdding Total Current Liabilities and Total Owner's Equity: 727,140.68 + 28,405,999.64 = 29,133,140.32, which matches Total Assets. So, indeed, Total Liabilities is just the current liabilities of 727,140.68.\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.025 or 2.5%. Maybe the example had more liabilities. For this problem, it seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet doesn't list any other liabilities besides current ones. So, it's correct.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 4,142,813.42\n- **Total Revenue:** 14,542,813.42\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{4,142,813.42}{14,542,813.42} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 28.49\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -17,417,367.15\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 727,140.68\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68} \\approx -23.95 \\]\n\nThis is a very negative ratio, indicating that the company's operating cash flow is insufficient to cover its current liabilities.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.02', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.49%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-23.95'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was presented with two decimal places, Gross Profit Margin with two decimal places and a percent sign, and Operating Cash Flow Ratio with two decimal places. Let's format our answers similarly.\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.02496 → 0.02\n- Gross Profit Margin: 28.49% (already formatted)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -23.952 → -23.95\n\nSo, the final JSON is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.02', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.49%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-23.95'}}\n```\n\nBut wait, the example had '0.14', '18.80%', '-3.90'. Maybe they rounded differently. For consistency, let's keep two decimal places where applicable.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.02', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.49%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-23.95'}}\n```",
