                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step, explaining how to calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all sales are credit sales) = Main Business Revenue = \\$14,542,813.42\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = \\$0.00 (from initial balance sheet)\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = \\$10,221,447.35\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**\n\\[ \\text{Average AR} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning AR} + \\text{Ending AR}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 10,221,447.35}{2} = \\$5,110,723.675 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{AR Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{14,542,813.42}{5,110,723.675} \\approx 2.85 \\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -\\$17,417,367.15\n- Current Liabilities = \\$727,140.68\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68} \\approx -23.95 \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems to be the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided (both had the same value). So, it's likely:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nWhich is the same as above:\n\\[ \\approx -23.95 \\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales = Total Revenue = \\$14,542,813.42\n- Beginning Total Assets = \\$28,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = \\$29,133,140.32\n\n**Average Total Assets:**\n\\[ \\text{Average Assets} = \\frac{28,000,000 + 29,133,140.32}{2} = \\frac{57,133,140.32}{2} = \\$28,566,570.16 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{14,542,813.42}{28,566,570.16} \\approx 0.51 \\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = \\$727,140.68 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed)\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = \\$28,405,999.64\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{727,140.68}{28,405,999.64} \\approx 0.0256 \\]\n\nHowever, looking at the example provided, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity, which seems correct. Here, Total Liabilities are only Current Liabilities since no other liabilities are mentioned.\n\nBut in the balance sheet, \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" is \\$29,133,140.32, and \"Total Owner's Equity\" is \\$28,405,999.64, so:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity} - \\text{Total Owner's Equity} = 29,133,140.32 - 28,405,999.64 = \\$727,140.68 \\]\n\nWhich matches the Current Liabilities. So, the calculation is correct at approximately 0.026, but the example had 0.16, so maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, in the example, Debt to Equity was calculated as:\n\nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = \\$1,861,550.92\nTotal Equity = \\$11,354,858.57\nRatio = 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16\n\nSimilarly here:\n\nTotal Liabilities = \\$727,140.68\nTotal Equity = \\$28,405,999.64\nRatio = 727,140.68 / 28,405,999.64 ≈ 0.0256\n\nMaybe the example had more liabilities not shown, but here it's just current liabilities. So, it's correct at ~0.026.\n\nBut to match the format, let's keep it to two decimal places: 0.03.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.85', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-23.95', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-23.95', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.51', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'} }\n```\n\n**Wait a minute!** \n\nLooking back at the example, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio were the same, but in the problem, they might be different. \n\nActually, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is usually:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nWhich is the same as Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio. So both are -23.95.\n\nBut in the example, both were -3.90, which suggests they are the same. So keeping both the same is correct.\n\nSimilarly, the Debt to Equity Ratio in the example was 0.16, and here it's much lower at 0.03, which seems correct given the numbers.\n\nSo, the final answer is correct as above.\n\nHowever, the example had ratios with two decimal places, so let's adjust to two decimal places:\n\n- AR Turnover: 2.85 (already two decimals)\n- Operating ratios: -23.95\n- Total Asset Turnover: 0.51\n- Debt to Equity: 0.03\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.85', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-23.95', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-23.95', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.51', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'} }\n```",
