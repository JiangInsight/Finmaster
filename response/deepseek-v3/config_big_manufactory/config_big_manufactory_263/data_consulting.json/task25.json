                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We have three financial statements: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement. We need to calculate three ratios:\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n2. **Net Profit Margin**\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 727,140.68\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so **Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68**\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 28,405,999.64\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{727,140.68}{28,405,999.64} \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\\[ \\frac{727,140.68}{28,405,999.64} \\approx 0.0256 \\]\n\nExpressed to two decimal places: 0.03\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have considered more liabilities if any, but here only current liabilities are given. Maybe the company has no long-term debt, so this seems correct.\n\nWait, in the example, they had only current liabilities as well, and the ratio was 0.16. Here, our equity is much larger compared to liabilities, so a small ratio makes sense.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 405,999.64\n- **Total Revenue:** 14,542,813.42\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{405,999.64}{14,542,813.42} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nCompute:\n\\[ \\frac{405,999.64}{14,542,813.42} \\approx 0.0279 \\]\n\\[ 0.0279 \\times 100\\% \\approx 2.79\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with cash flow from operations.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -17,417,367.15\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 727,140.68\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68} \\]\n\nCompute:\n\\[ \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68} \\approx -23.95 \\]\n\nThis seems very negative, but the numbers are correct based on the data. Maybe the company had a large outflow in operating activities this period.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '2.79%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-23.95'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure no mistakes.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity:**\n   - Liabilities: 727,140.68\n   - Equity: 28,405,999.64\n   - 727,140.68 / 28,405,999.64 ≈ 0.0256 → 0.03 (rounded)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: 405,999.64\n   - Revenue: 14,542,813.42\n   - (405,999.64 / 14,542,813.42) * 100 ≈ 2.79%\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -17,417,367.15\n   - Current Liabilities: 727,140.68\n   - -17,417,367.15 / 727,140.68 ≈ -23.95\n\nEverything checks out. The negative operating cash flow ratio indicates that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover current liabilities in this period, which could be a concern if this trend continues. The net profit margin is positive, indicating profitability, and the debt to equity ratio is very low, suggesting minimal reliance on debt financing.\n\n**Final JSON:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '2.79%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-23.95'} }\n```",
