                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. We have three financial statements: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement. We need to calculate three ratios:\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**\n3. **Quick Ratio**\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -17,417,367.15\n- Net Profit (from income statement) = 405,999.64\n\nWait a minute, the net cash flow from operating activities is negative, and net profit is positive. That seems unusual because typically, if a company is profitable, you'd expect positive operating cash flow unless there are significant non-cash expenses or changes in working capital that are negative.\n\nBut let's plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{405,999.64} \\approx -42.90 \\]\n\nThis negative ratio doesn't make much sense in terms of interpretation. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the components.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement:\n- Net Profit: 405,999.64\n- Depreciation: 91,498.88 (added back)\n- Increase in Accounts Receivable: -10,221,447.35 (negative because it's an increase)\n- Increase in Interest Receivable: -20,559.00\n- Increase in Inventory: -8,400,000.00\n- Increase in Tax Payable: 727,140.68\n\nAdding these up:\n405,999.64 + 91,498.88 - 10,221,447.35 - 20,559.00 - 8,400,000.00 + 727,140.68 = ?\n\nLet me calculate step by step:\n405,999.64 + 91,498.88 = 497,498.52\n497,498.52 - 10,221,447.35 = -9,723,948.83\n-9,723,948.83 - 20,559.00 = -9,744,507.83\n-9,744,507.83 - 8,400,000.00 = -18,144,507.83\n-18,144,507.83 + 727,140.68 = -17,417,367.15\n\nYes, that matches the given Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities. So the calculation is correct, but the ratio is negative, which is unusual but possible if the company has a lot of increases in working capital items (like receivables and inventory) that outweigh the net profit.\n\nBut in the example provided, the ratio was positive even though net profit was negative, which suggests that operating cash flow was less negative than net income. Here, it's the opposite.\n\nPerhaps the absolute value is considered, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is supposed to be positive, indicating how many times the operating cash flow covers the net income, but here it's negative, which doesn't make sense in that context.\n\nGiven that, maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the formula. Maybe it's the absolute value or perhaps the ratio is not meaningful in this case. But based on the formula, the calculation is correct.\n\nFor the sake of this exercise, I'll proceed with the calculated value.\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate Average Current Assets:\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Current Assets (2023-12-31): 20,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets (2024-02-05): 21,224,639.20\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{20,000,000 + 21,224,639.20}{2} = \\frac{41,224,639.20}{2} = 20,612,319.60 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 14,542,813.42\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{14,542,813.42}{20,612,319.60} \\approx 0.7055 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.71\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Quick Assets** are current assets minus inventory and prepaid expenses (if any). Here, from the balance sheet, quick assets would be:\n- Cash on Hand: 1,482,632.85\n- Bank Deposits: 1,100,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 20,559.00\n- Accounts Receivable: 10,221,447.35\nTotal Quick Assets = 1,482,632.85 + 1,100,000.00 + 20,559.00 + 10,221,447.35 = 12,824,639.20\n\n(Note: Inventory is 8,400,000.00, which is excluded from quick assets.)\n\n**Current Liabilities** from the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{12,824,639.20}{727,140.68} \\approx 17.64 \\]\n\nThis seems unusually high, indicating that the company has a lot of liquid assets compared to its current liabilities. Maybe I missed something. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, current liabilities are only Taxes Payable: 727,140.68. No Accounts Payable or other current liabilities are present. So the calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating all three ratios:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: -42.90\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.71\n3. Quick Ratio: 17.64\n\nHowever, the quick ratio seems extremely high, which might indicate that the company has very low current liabilities compared to its quick assets, or perhaps there's an error in identifying quick assets. But based on the given data, this is the calculation.\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, the quick ratio was 1.54, which is more typical. Maybe in this case, the company indeed has very high quick assets relative to liabilities.\n\nSo, the final JSON is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-42.90', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.71', 'Quick Ratio': '17.64'}}\n```\n\nBut let me cross-validate the quick ratio calculation:\n\nQuick Assets:\n- Cash on Hand: 1,482,632.85\n- Bank Deposits: 1,100,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 20,559.00\n- Accounts Receivable: 10,221,447.35\nTotal: 1,482,632.85 + 1,100,000 = 2,582,632.85\n+ 20,559 = 2,603,191.85\n+ 10,221,447.35 = 12,824,639.20\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 727,140.68\n\n12,824,639.20 / 727,140.68 â‰ˆ 17.64\n\nIt's correct. Maybe the company has just started, and liabilities are low while receivables are high.\n\nSimilarly, the operating cash flow to net income is negative because the operating cash flow is more negative than the net income is positive, which can happen if there's a large increase in working capital items like receivables and inventory.\n\nSo, the answer stands as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-42.90', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.71', 'Quick Ratio': '17.64'}}\n```",
