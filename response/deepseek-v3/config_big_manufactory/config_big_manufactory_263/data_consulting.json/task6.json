                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I recall that the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. The formula for Net Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us a percentage that represents how much out of every dollar of revenue the company keeps as profit.\n\n### Identifying the Necessary Values\nFrom the given income statement, I can see:\n\n- **Net Profit**: 405,999.64\n- **Total Revenue**: 14,542,813.42\n\nThese are the two numbers I need to plug into the formula.\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\nNow, let's do the calculation:\n\n1. Divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n   \\[ \\frac{405,999.64}{14,542,813.42} \\]\n\n   Let's compute that:\n   \\[ 405,999.64 ÷ 14,542,813.42 ≈ 0.02791 \\]\n\n2. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n   \\[ 0.02791 \\times 100 ≈ 2.791\\% \\]\n\n### Rounding the Percentage\nLooking at the example provided, the percentage was rounded to two decimal places. So, I'll round 2.791% to two decimal places:\n\n\\[ 2.791\\% ≈ 2.79\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let's verify:\n\n- 2.79% of 14,542,813.42:\n  \\[ 14,542,813.42 \\times 0.0279 ≈ 405,744.49 \\]\n\nThe actual Net Profit is 405,999.64, which is very close to our calculation (the slight difference is due to rounding). So, the calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 2.79%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '2.79%'} }\n```",
