                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio** based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nFirst, what is the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio? From what I understand, it's a measure of a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Operating Cash Flow** is the net cash provided by operating activities (from the cash flow statement).\n- **Total Debt** is the sum of all the company's debts (from the balance sheet).\n\n### Identifying the Components from the Given Data\n\nLet's look at the provided financial statements to find these components.\n\n#### 1. Operating Cash Flow\n\nFrom the **cash flow statement**, the line item is:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -17,417,367.15\n\nSo, Operating Cash Flow = -17,417,367.15\n\n#### 2. Total Debt\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**, under liabilities, we have:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 727,140.68\n- There's no mention of long-term liabilities or other debts in this balance sheet.\n\nSo, Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68\n\nWait a minute—is that correct? Typically, total debt includes both current and long-term liabilities. But in this balance sheet, there's no separate line for long-term liabilities; all liabilities seem to be under current liabilities. \n\nLooking back at the example provided in the task:\n- In the example, Total Current Liabilities were 1,861,550.92, and there were no long-term liabilities mentioned, so Total Debt was taken as Total Current Liabilities.\n\nSimilarly, here, Total Debt would be Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, plug the numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68} \\approx -23.95 \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nJust to ensure this makes sense:\n- Negative operating cash flow means the company is burning cash from operations.\n- The ratio is negative, indicating that the operating cash flow isn't sufficient to cover the debt; in fact, it's negative, which is a bad sign.\n- The magnitude (-23.95) shows how much the operating cash flow is in deficit compared to the debt.\n\n### Comparing with the Example\n\nIn the example provided:\n- Operating Cash Flow: -7,259,994.10\n- Total Debt: 1,861,550.92\n- Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90\n\nOur calculation follows the same method, leading to -23.95.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully going through the steps, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-23.95'}}\n```",
