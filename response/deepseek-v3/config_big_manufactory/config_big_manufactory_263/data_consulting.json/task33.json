                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each ratio, explain what it is, and then calculate it based on the given data.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -17,417,367.15\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68} \\approx -23.95 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities are:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68\nAssuming no long-term debt is given, Total Debt = 727,140.68\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-17,417,367.15}{727,140.68} \\approx -23.95 \\]\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 10,400,000.00\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- End Inventory = 8,400,000.00\nAverage Inventory = (Initial + End) / 2 = (0 + 8,400,000) / 2 = 4,200,000\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{10,400,000}{4,200,000} \\approx 2.48 \\]\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Equity}} \\]\n\nTotal Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 727,140.68\nTotal Equity = Total Owner's Equity (end amount) = 28,405,999.64\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{727,140.68}{28,405,999.64} \\approx 0.026 \\]\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 21,224,639.20\n- Inventory = 8,400,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 727,140.68\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{21,224,639.20 - 8,400,000}{727,140.68} = \\frac{12,824,639.20}{727,140.68} \\approx 17.64 \\]\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 21,224,639.20\n- Current Liabilities = 727,140.68\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{21,224,639.20}{727,140.68} \\approx 29.19 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling all these calculated ratios into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-23.95', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-23.95', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '2.48', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Quick Ratio': '17.64', 'Current Ratio': '29.19'} }\n```\n\n**Note:** \n- The Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Cash Flow to Debt Ratio are both negative, indicating that the company's operating cash flow is negative relative to its liabilities and debt, which is a concerning sign.\n- The Inventory Turnover Ratio of 2.48 suggests that the company turns over its inventory about 2.48 times during the period.\n- The Debt to Equity Ratio is very low (0.03), indicating minimal debt relative to equity.\n- The Quick Ratio and Current Ratio are both very high, suggesting strong liquidity, but this should be viewed in the context of the negative operating cash flow. High ratios might also indicate inefficiency in using current assets.\n\nLet me know if you'd like any clarification or adjustments to these calculations!",
