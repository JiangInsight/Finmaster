                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Gross Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"Gross Profit Margin\" means. From what I recall, the Gross Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n\nThe formula for Gross Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Gross Profit** = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n- **Total Revenue** is the total income from sales.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 14,542,813.42\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 10,400,000.00\n- **Gross Profit**: 4,142,813.42 (This is already given, but it's also calculated as Total Revenue - COGS, which checks out: 14,542,813.42 - 10,400,000.00 = 4,142,813.42)\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nNow, plugging the numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{4,142,813.42}{14,542,813.42} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,142,813.42}{14,542,813.42} \\approx 0.2848 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.2848 \\times 100 \\approx 28.48\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let's re-calculate:\n\n\\[ 4,142,813.42 \\div 14,542,813.42 \\approx 0.2848 \\]\n\\[ 0.2848 \\times 100 = 28.48\\% \\]\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Gross Profit Margin is approximately 28.48%.\n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '28.48%'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\nIn the example provided, the Gross Profit Margin was calculated as 18.80%. Here's how that was derived:\n\n- Gross Profit: 1,021,018.59\n- Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1,021,018.59}{5,431,018.59} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 18.80\\% \\]\n\nThis confirms that the method is correct. Applying the same method to our problem gives us 28.48%.\n\n### Potential Pitfalls\n\nOne thing to be careful about is ensuring that we're using the correct figures. Sometimes, \"Revenue\" might be listed differently, but here it's clearly labeled as \"Total Revenue.\" Also, \"Gross Profit\" is directly given, which aligns with the calculation (Revenue - COGS), so we can be confident in using it.\n\nAnother point is to ensure that the division is done correctly, especially with large numbers, to avoid decimal place errors. Here, the numbers are straightforward, but with more complex figures, it's easy to misplace a decimal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully going through the numbers and verifying the calculations, the Gross Profit Margin for the given income statement is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '28.48%'}}\n```",
