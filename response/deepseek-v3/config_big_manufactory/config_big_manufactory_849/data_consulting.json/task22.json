                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis problem step by step. We need to calculate two key financial ratios: the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin, based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**\n   - This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n   - Formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - **Quick Assets** typically include:\n     - Cash and cash equivalents\n     - Marketable securities (if any)\n     - Accounts receivable\n     - (Note: Inventory is excluded because it's not as liquid)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n     \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's extract the necessary figures.\n\n#### Balance Sheet (End of Period - 2024-02-05):\n\n**Current Assets:**\n- Cash on Hand: 9,383,594.56\n- Bank Deposits: 2,573,984.92\n- Interest Receivable: 23,583.67\n- Accounts Receivable: 6,408,987.07\n- Inventory: 5,600,000.00\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\n- Accounts Payable: 3,500,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 819,436.82\n- Total Current Liabilities: 4,319,436.82\n\n#### Income Statement:\n\n- Total Revenue: 16,388,736.33\n- Net Profit: 1,290,835.16\n\n### Calculating Quick Ratio\n\n**Step 1: Identify Quick Assets**\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n(Note: Inventory is excluded)\n\nCalculating:\n- Cash on Hand: 9,383,594.56\n- Bank Deposits: 2,573,984.92\n- Accounts Receivable: 6,408,987.07\n- Interest Receivable: 23,583.67\n\nTotal Quick Assets = 9,383,594.56 + 2,573,984.92 + 6,408,987.07 + 23,583.67\n= 9,383,594.56 + 2,573,984.92 = 11,957,579.48\n+ 6,408,987.07 = 18,366,566.55\n+ 23,583.67 = 18,390,150.22\n\n**Step 2: Identify Current Liabilities**\nTotal Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Quick Ratio**\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities\n= 18,390,150.22 / 4,319,436.82\n\nLet's do the division:\n18,390,150.22 ÷ 4,319,436.82 ≈ 4.257\n\nSo, Quick Ratio ≈ 4.26\n\n*Wait a minute*, that seems quite high. Let me double-check the components of Quick Assets. \n\nIs Interest Receivable typically included in Quick Assets? Upon checking, yes, it's a short-term receivable, so it's included. \n\nBut looking back at the example provided in the task, their Quick Ratio was 1.54, which is more typical. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the example, their Quick Assets were:\nCash on Hand: 270,005.90\nBank Deposits: 164,645.57\nInterest Receivable: 2,672.87\nAccounts Receivable: 2,429,482.13\nTotal: 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 = 434,651.47\n+ 2,672.87 = 437,324.34\n+ 2,429,482.13 = 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio: 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\nThat checks out with their solution.\n\nIn our case, Quick Assets are much higher relative to Current Liabilities, leading to a higher ratio. Maybe the company is very liquid at this point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Bank Deposits are not considered as part of Cash and Cash Equivalents here, but usually, they are. \n\nGiven that, our calculation seems correct: Quick Ratio ≈ 4.26\n\nBut let's see if Bank Deposits are part of Cash and Cash Equivalents. In the cash flow statement, \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" ending balance is 11,957,579.48, which is Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits (9,383,594.56 + 2,573,984.92 = 11,957,579.48). So, yes, Bank Deposits are part of Cash.\n\nSo, Quick Assets = Cash and Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n= 11,957,579.48 + 6,408,987.07 + 23,583.67\n= 18,390,150.22\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 4,319,436.82\n\nQuick Ratio = 18,390,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 4.26\n\nThis seems correct based on the data.\n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\n\n**Step 1: Identify Net Profit and Total Revenue**\nFrom Income Statement:\n- Net Profit: 1,290,835.16\n- Total Revenue: 16,388,736.33\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Formula**\nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100%\n= (1,290,835.16 / 16,388,736.33) * 100%\n\nCalculating the division:\n1,290,835.16 ÷ 16,388,736.33 ≈ 0.07876\n\nMultiply by 100%:\n≈ 7.876%\n\nSo, Net Profit Margin ≈ 7.88%\n\n*Checking the example:*\nTheir Net Profit was -1,645,141.43, Revenue was 5,431,018.59\n(-1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59) * 100% ≈ -30.29%, which matches their solution.\n\nOur calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- Quick Ratio: 4.26\n- Net Profit Margin: 7.88%\n\nBut looking back at the example's format, they presented the ratios with two decimal places and Net Profit Margin as a percentage with two decimal places. So, we'll follow the same format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '4.26', 'Net Profit Margin': '7.88%'} }\n```\n\n*However*, let me cross-validate the Quick Ratio once more to ensure no misclassification.\n\nAre all Current Assets included correctly? \n\nTotal Current Assets per Balance Sheet: 23,990,150.22\nComponents:\nCash on Hand: 9,383,594.56\nBank Deposits: 2,573,984.92\nInterest Receivable: 23,583.67\nAccounts Receivable: 6,408,987.07\nInventory: 5,600,000.00\nSum: 9,383,594.56 + 2,573,984.92 = 11,957,579.48\n+ 23,583.67 = 11,981,163.15\n+ 6,408,987.07 = 18,390,150.22\n+ 5,600,000.00 = 23,990,150.22 (matches)\n\nQuick Assets exclude Inventory, so 18,390,150.22\nCurrent Liabilities: 4,319,436.82\nQuick Ratio: 18,390,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 4.26\n\nNo issues found. The company indeed has a high Quick Ratio, indicating strong liquidity.\n\nSimilarly, Net Profit Margin calculation is straightforward and correct.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '4.26', 'Net Profit Margin': '7.88%'} }\n```",
