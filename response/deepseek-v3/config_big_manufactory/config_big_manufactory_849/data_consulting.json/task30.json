                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 23,990,150.22\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 4,319,436.82\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 23,990,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 5.55\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 9,383,594.56\n- Bank Deposits = 2,573,984.92\n- Interest Receivable = 23,583.67\n- Accounts Receivable = 6,408,987.07\n- Total Quick Assets = 9,383,594.56 + 2,573,984.92 + 23,583.67 + 6,408,987.07 ≈ 18,390,150.22\n- Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 18,390,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 4.26\n\n*Wait a minute*, the quick ratio typically excludes inventory, but it seems I've included interest receivable which might not always be considered. Let me double-check the components:\n\nTypically, Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable. Interest Receivable might be included if it's expected to be received soon, but sometimes it's excluded. For this calculation, let's stick to Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable:\n\nQuick Assets = 9,383,594.56 (Cash) + 2,573,984.92 (Bank) + 6,408,987.07 (AR) = 18,366,566.55\n\nQuick Ratio = 18,366,566.55 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 4.25\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, they seem to include interest receivable in quick assets. So to match their method, let's go with the first calculation: 4.26.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no long-term liabilities listed) = 4,319,436.82\n- Total Assets = 33,610,271.98\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 4,319,436.82 / 33,610,271.98 ≈ 0.1285 or 0.13\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,290,835.16\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 4,319,436.82 / 29,290,835.16 ≈ 0.1475 or 0.15\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,316,405.44\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ -1.462\n\n*But wait*, the example provided seems to have a negative cash flow to debt ratio as well (-3.90), so this seems correct.\n\nHowever, sometimes this ratio is calculated using average debt or absolute value, but given the example, negative is acceptable.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '5.55', 'Quick Ratio': '4.26', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.46'}}\n```\n\n*Reviewing the example's approach:*\n- They might have rounded differently or included slightly different components (like interest receivable in quick assets). Given that, my calculations seem consistent with their method.\n\nSo, finalizing with the above values.\n\n**Correction on Quick Ratio:**\nUpon re-reading, the quick ratio typically excludes inventory and prepaid expenses. The quick assets are cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Here, bank deposits are cash equivalents, and interest receivable is a short-term receivable, so including it seems reasonable.\n\nBut to match the example's approach exactly, let's see how they calculated it:\n\nIn the example:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand (270,005.90) + Bank Deposits (164,645.57) + Interest Receivable (2,672.87) + Accounts Receivable (2,429,482.13) = 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio = 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSo they included all current assets except inventory in quick assets. Following that:\n\nFor our problem:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand (9,383,594.56) + Bank Deposits (2,573,984.92) + Interest Receivable (23,583.67) + Accounts Receivable (6,408,987.07) = 18,390,150.22\nCurrent Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\nQuick Ratio = 18,390,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 4.26\n\nThis seems correct based on their method.\n\n**Final Adjusted Answer:**\nAll ratios seem correctly calculated based on the given data and the example's methodology.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '5.55', 'Quick Ratio': '4.26', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.46'}}\n```",
