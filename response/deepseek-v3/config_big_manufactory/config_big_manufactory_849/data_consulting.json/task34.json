                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step, explaining how to calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Average Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,316,405.44\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- End Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82  \n(Since initial current liabilities are 0, average is just the end amount.)\n\nCalculation:\n= -6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ -1.46\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82  \n(No long-term liabilities are given, so only current liabilities are considered as debt.)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,290,835.16\n\nCalculation:\n= 4,319,436.82 / 29,290,835.16 ≈ 0.15\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 16,388,736.33\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 28,000,000.00  \n- End Total Assets = 33,610,271.98  \nAverage Total Assets = (28,000,000 + 33,610,271.98) / 2 = 30,805,135.99\n\nCalculation:\n= 16,388,736.33 / 30,805,135.99 ≈ 0.53\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 23,990,150.22  \n- Inventory = 5,600,000.00  \n- Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n\nCalculation:\n= (23,990,150.22 - 5,600,000.00) / 4,319,436.82  \n= 18,390,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 4.26\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n(This is similar to the first ratio; sometimes they are the same.)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,316,405.44\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n\nCalculation:\n= -6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ -1.46\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 1,290,835.16\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Owner's Equity = 28,000,000.00  \n- End Owner's Equity = 29,290,835.16  \nAverage Equity = (28,000,000 + 29,290,835.16) / 2 = 28,645,417.58\n\nCalculation:\n= 1,290,835.16 / 28,645,417.58 ≈ 0.045 or 4.5%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable  \n(Assuming all sales are credit sales since no cash sales are mentioned.)\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 16,388,736.33\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00  \n- End Accounts Receivable = 6,408,987.07  \nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0 + 6,408,987.07) / 2 = 3,204,493.535\n\nCalculation:\n= 16,388,736.33 / 3,204,493.535 ≈ 5.11\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.46', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.53', 'Quick Ratio': '4.26', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.46', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '4.50%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.11'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify one of the calculations to ensure accuracy. For the Quick Ratio:\n- Quick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 23,990,150.22 - 5,600,000 = 18,390,150.22\n- Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n- Quick Ratio = 18,390,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 4.26 (correct)\n\nSimilarly, for ROE:\n- Net Income = 1,290,835.16\n- Average Equity = (28,000,000 + 29,290,835.16)/2 = 28,645,417.58\n- ROE = 1,290,835.16 / 28,645,417.58 ≈ 0.045 or 4.5% (correct)\n\nEverything checks out!",
