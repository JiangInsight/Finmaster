                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two things: the Free Cash Flow (FCF) and the Current Assets Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** This is the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. It's an important measure because it shows how efficient a company is at generating cash and can be used for expansion, dividends, or other purposes.\n\n   A common way to calculate FCF is:\n   \\[\n   FCF = \\text{Net Cash from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures}\n   \\]\n   From the cash flow statement, \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" and \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" (which includes capital expenditures) are provided.\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2}\n   \\]\n   From the balance sheet, we have the initial and end amounts for total current assets, and from the income statement, we have the total revenue.\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- Initial Total Current Assets: 20,000,000.00\n- End Total Current Assets: 23,990,150.22\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue: 16,388,736.33\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -6,316,405.44\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -1,726,015.08\n  - This includes the purchase of fixed assets (capital expenditures).\n\n### Calculating Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash from Operating Activities: -6,316,405.44\n- Capital Expenditures (part of Investing Activities): Purchase of Fixed Assets is 1,726,015.08 (but Net Cash Flow from Investing is -1,726,015.08, which implies this is the total spent on investing, likely all on fixed assets).\n\nHowever, FCF is typically calculated as:\n\\[\nFCF = \\text{Net Cash from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures}\n\\]\nHere, Capital Expenditures are the purchases of fixed assets, which is 1,726,015.08.\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the FCF seems to be the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents, which is -8,042,420.52. \n\nWait, in the example:\n- Net Increase in cash was -7,565,348.53, which matched the FCF in the solution.\nSo perhaps FCF is simply the net increase in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nGiven that, in this problem:\n- Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: -8,042,420.52\n\nSo FCF = -8,042,420.52\n\nBut let's cross-validate:\nIn the example:\nNet Cash from Operating: -7,259,994.10\nNet Cash from Investing: -305,354.43\nTotal: -7,565,348.53 (matches Net Increase)\nSo FCF is indeed the net increase in cash.\n\nTherefore, here:\nNet Increase: -8,042,420.52\nSo FCF = -8,042,420.52\n\n### Calculating Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nFormula:\n\\[\n\\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}}\n\\]\nCalculate Average Current Assets:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{20,000,000 + 23,990,150.22}{2} = \\frac{43,990,150.22}{2} = 21,995,075.11\n\\]\nNow, Total Revenue = 16,388,736.33\n\\[\n\\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{16,388,736.33}{21,995,075.11} \\approx 0.745\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.75\n\nBut in the example, it was rounded to two decimal places (0.68), so we'll do the same here.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-8042420.52', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.75'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example's calculation for the turnover ratio:\n\nExample had:\nTotal Revenue: 5,431,018.59\nAverage Current Assets: (8,000,000 + 7,956,806.47)/2 = 7,978,403.235\nRatio: 5,431,018.59 / 7,978,403.235 ≈ 0.6808 → 0.68\n\nSimilarly here:\n16,388,736.33 / 21,995,075.11 ≈ 0.745 → 0.75\n\nBut the example's initial current assets were 8,000,000 and end 7,956,806.47, so average is slightly less than initial.\n\nHere, initial is 20,000,000, end is 23,990,150.22, so average is higher.\n\nSo 0.75 seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the calculation again:\n\nAverage Current Assets = (20,000,000 + 23,990,150.22) / 2 = 43,990,150.22 / 2 = 21,995,075.11\n\nTotal Revenue = 16,388,736.33\n\n16,388,736.33 / 21,995,075.11 ≈ 0.745\n\nSo 0.75 is correct when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n### Verifying FCF\n\nIn the example:\nFCF was the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents: -7,565,348.53\n\nHere, \"Net Increase\" is -8,042,420.52, so FCF is -8,042,420.52.\n\n### Final Confirmation\n\nEverything checks out. \n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-8042420.52', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.75'}}\n```",
