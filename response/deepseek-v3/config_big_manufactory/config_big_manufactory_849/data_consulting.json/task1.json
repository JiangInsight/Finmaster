From the given data, the \"Total Current Assets\" at the end of the reporting period is **23,990,150.22**.\n\n2. **Identify Current Liabilities**: Current liabilities are obligations that are due within one year. From the given data, the \"Total Current Liabilities\" at the end of the reporting period is **4,319,436.82**.\n\n3. **Calculate Current Ratio**: The Current Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Current Assets by Total Current Liabilities. \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{23,990,150.22}{4,319,436.82}\n   \\]\n\n   Performing the division:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} \\approx 5.55\n   \\]\n\n4. **Round the Result**: The result is rounded to two decimal places, giving us **5.55**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '5.55'} }\n```",
