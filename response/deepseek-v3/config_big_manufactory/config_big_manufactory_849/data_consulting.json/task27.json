                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Net Cash Ratio, Current Assets Turnover Ratio, and Quick Ratio based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Net Cash Ratio**: This ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its cash and cash equivalents. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**: This ratio indicates how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}}\n   \\]\n   *Average Current Assets* is typically calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)**: This measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   In this case, we'll consider Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, and Accounts Receivable as the liquid assets.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n  - Cash on Hand (End_amount): 9,383,594.56\n  - Bank Deposits (End_amount): 2,573,984.92\n  - Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 9,383,594.56 + 2,573,984.92 = 11,957,579.48\n\n- **Accounts Receivable (End_amount)**: 6,408,987.07\n\n- **Current Liabilities (End_amount)**: 4,319,436.82\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 16,388,736.33\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (for average current assets):\n\n- **Beginning Current Assets**: 20,000,000.00\n- **Ending Current Assets**: 23,990,150.22\n- **Average Current Assets** = (20,000,000 + 23,990,150.22) / 2 = 21,995,075.11\n\n### Calculating the Ratios\n\n1. **Net Cash Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{11,957,579.48}{4,319,436.82} \\approx 2.77\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{16,388,736.33}{21,995,075.11} \\approx 0.745\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places: 0.75\n   \n3. **Quick Ratio**:\n   Liquid Assets = Cash and Cash Equivalents + Accounts Receivable\n   = 11,957,579.48 + 6,408,987.07 = 18,366,566.55\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{18,366,566.55}{4,319,436.82} \\approx 4.25\n   \\]\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n  - 9,383,594.56 + 2,573,984.92 = 11,957,579.48 ✔\n\n- **Average Current Assets**:\n  - (20,000,000 + 23,990,150.22) / 2 = 43,990,150.22 / 2 = 21,995,075.11 ✔\n\n- **Net Cash Ratio**:\n  - 11,957,579.48 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 2.77 ✔\n\n- **Current Assets Turnover**:\n  - 16,388,736.33 / 21,995,075.11 ≈ 0.745 → 0.75 ✔\n\n- **Quick Ratio**:\n  - (11,957,579.48 + 6,408,987.07) / 4,319,436.82 = 18,366,566.55 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 4.25 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '2.77', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.75', 'Quick Ratio': '4.25'}}\n```",
