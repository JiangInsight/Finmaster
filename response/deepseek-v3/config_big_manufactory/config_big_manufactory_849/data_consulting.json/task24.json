                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Net Cash Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Net Cash Ratio**: This ratio assesses a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its cash and cash equivalents. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   However, looking at the example provided, it seems the \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\" was calculated instead, which is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}}\n   \\]\n   Given that the example had 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio' but the task asks for 'Net Cash Ratio', I'm a bit confused. I'll assume the task wants the 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio' based on the example. But to clarify, the Net Cash Ratio is typically as I first defined it. \n\n   Given the ambiguity, I'll calculate both:\n   - **Net Cash Ratio**: Cash and Cash Equivalents / Current Liabilities\n   - **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit\n\n   But since the example had 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio' labeled as 'Net Cash Ratio', maybe that's what's intended. I'll proceed with that unless corrected.\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount)**: 4,319,436.82\n- **Total Assets (End_amount)**: 33,610,271.98\n- **Total Liabilities**: Since Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity = Total Assets, and Owner's Equity is 29,290,835.16, then:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Assets} - \\text{Owner's Equity} = 33,610,271.98 - 29,290,835.16 = 4,319,436.82\n  \\]\n  (This matches the Total Current Liabilities, implying no long-term liabilities.)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -6,316,405.44\n- **Net Profit**: 1,290,835.16\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents (Ending Balance)**: 11,957,579.48\n\n### Calculating Ratios\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{4,319,436.82}{33,610,271.98}\n   \\]\n   Calculating:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4,319,436.82}{33,610,271.98} \\approx 0.1285 \\text{ or } 0.13 \\text{ when rounded to two decimal places}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio** (assuming this is the intended \"Net Cash Ratio\"):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} = \\frac{-6,316,405.44}{1,290,835.16}\n   \\]\n   Calculating:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-6,316,405.44}{1,290,835.16} \\approx -4.89\n   \\]\n   (This is negative, indicating that operating cash flow is negative while net income is positive, which is unusual.)\n\n   Alternatively, if \"Net Cash Ratio\" is indeed Cash / Current Liabilities:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{11,957,579.48}{4,319,436.82} \\approx 2.77\n   \\]\n   \nGiven the example had 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio' as 'Net Cash Ratio', but the name doesn't match, I think the first interpretation might be incorrect. More likely, \"Net Cash Ratio\" is Cash / Current Liabilities, which is a standard liquidity ratio.\n\nGiven that, and since the example might have mislabeled, I'll go with:\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.13\n- Net Cash Ratio (Cash / Current Liabilities): 2.77\n\nBut the example had 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio' as 'Net Cash Ratio', which is confusing. Maybe the task expects that. Given the ambiguity, I'll present both possibilities.\n\nHowever, since the task asks for \"Net Cash Ratio\" and the example calculated Operating Cash Flow to Net Income, but that doesn't make sense naming-wise, I think the correct is Cash / Current Liabilities.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nGiven the standard definitions and the most plausible interpretation:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Net Cash Ratio': '2.77'}}\n```\n\nBut if \"Net Cash Ratio\" is indeed supposed to be \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\", then:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Net Cash Ratio': '-4.89'}}\n```\n\nGiven the naming in the example seems incorrect, I believe the first interpretation is more accurate. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Net Cash Ratio': '2.77'}}\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Net Cash Ratio': '2.77'}}\n```",
