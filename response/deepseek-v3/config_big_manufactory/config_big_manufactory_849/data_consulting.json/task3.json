                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Asset Ratio\nFirst, what is the Debt to Asset Ratio? From what I understand, it's a financial metric that shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nBut sometimes, \"Total Debt\" can be interpreted as \"Total Liabilities.\" In the context of a balance sheet, liabilities are the debts the company owes. So, I think in this case, we can consider \"Total Current Liabilities\" as the debt since that's what the company owes in the short term.\n\nLooking at the given balance sheet, I see \"Total Current Liabilities\" and \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity.\" But \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" is equal to \"Total Assets,\" which makes sense because in accounting:\n\n\\[ \\text{Assets} = \\text{Liabilities} + \\text{Owner's Equity} \\]\n\nSo, the debt here would be the \"Total Current Liabilities,\" which is $4,319,436.82 as of the end date (2024-02-05).\n\n### Identifying Total Assets\nFrom the balance sheet, \"Total Assets\" at the end date is $33,610,271.98.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, applying the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{4,319,436.82}{33,610,271.98} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,319,436.82}{33,610,271.98} \\approx 0.1285 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 0.13.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure I'm doing this correctly:\n\nIn the example:\n- Total Current Liabilities: $1,861,550.92\n- Total Assets: $13,216,409.49\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.14\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,861,550.92}{13,216,409.49} \\approx 0.1408 \\]\n\nWhich rounds to 0.14, matching the given solution. So, my approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Calculation\nFor the problem at hand:\n- Total Current Liabilities: $4,319,436.82\n- Total Assets: $33,610,271.98\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,319,436.82}{33,610,271.98} \\approx 0.1285 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.13\n\n### Checking for Other Liabilities\nWait a minuteâ€”is \"Total Current Liabilities\" the only debt? Or are there other liabilities like long-term debts? \n\nLooking at the balance sheet, I see:\n- Accounts Payable\n- Taxes Payable\n- Total Current Liabilities (which is the sum of the above)\n- Paid-in Capital\n- Retained Earnings\n- Total Owner's Equity\n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\n\nThere's no mention of long-term liabilities like loans or bonds payable. So, it seems the only liabilities are the current ones. Therefore, \"Total Current Liabilities\" represents the total debt in this context.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully reviewing the balance sheet and the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio is correctly calculated using \"Total Current Liabilities\" divided by \"Total Assets.\"\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13'} }\n```",
