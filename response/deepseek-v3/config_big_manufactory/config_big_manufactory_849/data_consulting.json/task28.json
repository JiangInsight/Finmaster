                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. I'll go through each one separately, explaining how to find them using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Liabilities (Current Liabilities):** 4,319,436.82\n  - This is the sum of Accounts Payable (3,500,000.00) and Taxes Payable (819,436.82).\n- **Total Assets:** 33,610,271.98\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{4,319,436.82}{33,610,271.98} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,319,436.82}{33,610,271.98} \\approx 0.1285 \\]\n\nExpressed as a decimal, it's approximately 0.1285, or 12.85% when converted to a percentage. However, the example provided the ratio as a decimal without percentage, so we'll keep it as 0.13 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nBut looking back at the example, the ratio was given as '0.14', which seems to be rounded up from 0.1408 (if total liabilities were slightly higher). Here, our calculation is 0.1285, which rounds to 0.13. Maybe the example had slightly different numbers. For consistency, let's stick to our calculation.\n\nWait, in the given problem, Total Current Liabilities is directly provided as 4,319,436.82, which matches our sum. So, it's accurate.\n\nSo, Debt to Asset Ratio ≈ 0.13\n\nBut to match the format, let's keep two decimal places: '0.13'\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 4,788,736.33\n- **Total Revenue:** 16,388,736.33\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{4,788,736.33}{16,388,736.33} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,788,736.33}{16,388,736.33} \\approx 0.2922 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.2922 \\times 100 \\approx 29.22\\% \\]\n\nSo, Gross Profit Margin ≈ 29.22%\n\nLooking at the example, it was given as '18.80%', which was calculated similarly. Here, our calculation is straightforward.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -6,316,405.44\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Current Liabilities:** 4,319,436.82\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-6,316,405.44}{4,319,436.82} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{-6,316,405.44}{4,319,436.82} \\approx -1.462 \\]\n\nSo, Operating Cash Flow Ratio ≈ -1.46\n\nIn the example, it was '-3.90', which was also negative, indicating that operating cash flow was insufficient to cover current liabilities, similar here.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all three calculated ratios:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.13\n- Gross Profit Margin: 29.22%\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -1.46\n\nIn the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Gross Profit Margin': '29.22%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.46'}}\n```\n\nHowever, let's double-check the Debt to Asset Ratio calculation to ensure we're not missing anything.\n\n**Rechecking Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n\nTotal Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 3,500,000 + 819,436.82 = 4,319,436.82\n\nTotal Assets = 33,610,271.98\n\nRatio = 4,319,436.82 / 33,610,271.98 ≈ 0.1285 ≈ 0.13\n\nYes, it's correct.\n\nSimilarly, Gross Profit Margin is correct at 29.22%.\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio is correctly calculated as -1.46.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is accurate as per the calculations.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Gross Profit Margin': '29.22%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.46'}}\n```",
