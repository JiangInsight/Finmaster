                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** \\$4,319,436.82\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = \\$4,319,436.82\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** \\$29,290,835.16\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{4,319,436.82}{29,290,835.16} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{4,319,436.82}{29,290,835.16} \\approx 0.1475 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx 0.15 \\]\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenues. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** \\$1,290,835.16\n- **Total Revenue:** \\$16,388,736.33\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,290,835.16}{16,388,736.33} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nLet's calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{1,290,835.16}{16,388,736.33} \\approx 0.07876 \\]\n\\[ 0.07876 \\times 100\\% \\approx 7.876\\% \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx 7.88\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -\\$6,316,405.44 (negative value)\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** \\$4,319,436.82 (from balance sheet)\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-6,316,405.44}{4,319,436.82} \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{-6,316,405.44}{4,319,436.82} \\approx -1.462 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx -1.46 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Net Profit Margin': '7.88%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.46'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: \\$4,319,436.82\n   - Equity: \\$29,290,835.16\n   - \\$4,319,436.82 / \\$29,290,835.16 ≈ 0.1475 → 0.15 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: \\$1,290,835.16\n   - Revenue: \\$16,388,736.33\n   - (\\$1,290,835.16 / \\$16,388,736.33) * 100 ≈ 7.876% → 7.88% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -\\$6,316,405.44\n   - Current Liabilities: \\$4,319,436.82\n   - -\\$6,316,405.44 / \\$4,319,436.82 ≈ -1.462 → -1.46 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The negative operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is insufficient to cover its current liabilities, which could be a concern if this trend continues. The debt to equity ratio is low, suggesting the company is not heavily reliant on debt, and the net profit margin is positive, indicating profitability at the net income level.",
