I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Equity Ratio\nFirst, I need to understand what the Debt to Equity Ratio is. From what I know, it's a financial ratio that compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's used to measure a company's financial leverage and is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Components from the Balance Sheet\nNow, looking at the provided balance sheet, I need to identify:\n1. **Total Liabilities**: This seems to be the sum of all the company's debts or obligations.\n2. **Total Shareholders' Equity**: This is the owners' claim after all liabilities have been paid off.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: This is given as 4,319,436.82 at the end date (2024-02-05).\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so the total liabilities would just be the total current liabilities.\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: This is given as 29,290,835.16 at the end date.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} = \\frac{4,319,436.82}{29,290,835.16} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,319,436.82}{29,290,835.16} \\approx 0.1475 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 0.15.\n\n### Verifying the Components\nJust to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n- Are there any other liabilities besides \"Total Current Liabilities\"? The table doesn't list any, so it seems correct.\n- \"Total Owner's Equity\" is clearly given, and it includes both paid-in capital and retained earnings.\n\n### Final Answer\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.15.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15'} }\n```",
