                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all Main Business Revenue is credit sales) = 16,388,736.33\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial_amount) = 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 6,408,987.07\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**\n\\[ \\text{Average AR} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning AR} + \\text{Ending AR}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 6,408,987.07}{2} = 3,204,493.535 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{AR Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{16,388,736.33}{3,204,493.535} \\approx 5.11 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio was calculated differently. The example had:\n- Net Credit Sales = 5,431,018.59\n- Average AR = (0 + 2,429,482.13) / 2 = 1,214,741.065\n- Ratio = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct based on the formula. Maybe the example had a typo, or perhaps they used a different approach. I'll proceed with the standard formula.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Operating Cash Flow (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) = -6,316,405.44\n- Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 4,319,436.82\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-6,316,405.44}{4,319,436.82} \\approx -1.46 \\]\n\n*Hmm*, in the example, the operating cash flow ratio was the same as the operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio, both -3.90. Maybe they used the same value for both, or perhaps there's a distinction I'm missing. Typically, the operating cash flow ratio is operating cash flow divided by current liabilities, which is what I did. Maybe the other ratio is different.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems to be the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example. Maybe it's just named differently. \n\nGiven that, both would be -1.46.\n\nBut in the example, they were both -3.90. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the example's calculation:\n\nExample:\n- Operating Cash Flow = -7,259,994.10\n- Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\n- Ratio = -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90\n\nSo, it seems correct that both ratios are the same in this context. Maybe \"operating cash flow ratio\" is a typo and should be something else, but based on the data, it's the same.\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales (Total Revenue) = 16,388,736.33\n- Beginning Total Assets = 28,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 33,610,271.98\n\n**Average Total Assets:**\n\\[ \\text{Average TA} = \\frac{28,000,000 + 33,610,271.98}{2} = \\frac{61,610,271.98}{2} = 30,805,135.99 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{16,388,736.33}{30,805,135.99} \\approx 0.53 \\]\n\nIn the example:\n- Net Sales = 5,431,018.59\n- Average TA = (13,000,000 + 13,216,409.49) / 2 ≈ 13,108,204.745\n- Ratio = 5,431,018.59 / 13,108,204.745 ≈ 0.41\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct.\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities (Current Liabilities, since no long-term liabilities are given) = 4,319,436.82\n- Total Shareholders' Equity (End_amount) = 29,290,835.16\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{4,319,436.82}{29,290,835.16} \\approx 0.147 \\approx 0.15 \\]\n\nIn the example:\n- Total Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\n- Total Equity = 11,354,858.57\n- Ratio = 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16\n\nSo, my calculation is consistent with the example.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter calculating all the ratios:\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 5.11\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -1.46\n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -1.46\n4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio: 0.53\n5. Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.15\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the operating cash flow ratio and operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio were the same, so I'll keep them both as -1.46.\n\nBut wait, maybe the operating cash flow ratio is supposed to be operating cash flow divided by current liabilities, and operating cash flow to current liabilities is the same? Or perhaps one is supposed to be operating cash flow divided by something else. Given the ambiguity, I'll stick with both being the same unless specified otherwise.\n\nHere's the final JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.11', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.46', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.46', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.53', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15'}}\n```\n\n*Double-checking the calculations:*\n\n- AR Turnover: 16,388,736.33 / 3,204,493.535 ≈ 5.11 ✔\n- Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities: -6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ -1.46 ✔\n- Total Asset Turnover: 16,388,736.33 / 30,805,135.99 ≈ 0.53 ✔\n- Debt to Equity: 4,319,436.82 / 29,290,835.16 ≈ 0.15 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
