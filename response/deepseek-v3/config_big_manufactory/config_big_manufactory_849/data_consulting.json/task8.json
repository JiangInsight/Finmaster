                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Cash Ratio based on the given cash flow statement. First, I need to understand what the Net Cash Ratio is and how it's calculated.\n\n### Understanding the Net Cash Ratio\n\nFrom what I know, the Net Cash Ratio is a measure of a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its cash and cash equivalents. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nHowever, looking at the provided example, the solution shows 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio', which seems different. Maybe the term \"Net Cash Ratio\" here refers to something else, like the ratio of operating cash flow to net income.\n\nGiven that in the example:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = -1,645,141.43\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7,259,994.10\n- The ratio is calculated as: | -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 | = 4.41 (absolute value)\n\nSo, it seems the \"Net Cash Ratio\" in this context is the absolute value of the ratio of Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities to Net Profit.\n\n### Applying This to the Given Problem\n\nNow, let's look at the problem we need to solve:\n\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 1,290,835.16\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,316,405.44\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\left| \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{-6,316,405.44}{1,290,835.16} \\right| \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-6,316,405.44}{1,290,835.16} \\approx -4.893 \\]\n\nTaking the absolute value:\n\n\\[ | -4.893 | = 4.893 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 4.89\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the example:\n- Net Profit = -1,645,141.43\n- Operating Cash Flow = -7,259,994.10\n- Ratio = | -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 | = 4.41\n\nThis matches the given solution, so our approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Calculation for the Given Problem\n\nGiven:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,316,405.44\n- Net Profit = 1,290,835.16\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\left| \\frac{-6,316,405.44}{1,290,835.16} \\right| \\approx 4.893 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 4.89\n\n### Possible Missteps\n\nInitially, I thought the Net Cash Ratio might involve cash and cash equivalents divided by current liabilities, but the example clarified that it's about operating cash flow relative to net income. It's important to align the definition with the context provided by the example.\n\nAlso, ensuring that we take the absolute value is crucial since both numbers in the example were negative, yielding a positive ratio. Here, one is negative and one is positive, but the absolute value still gives a positive ratio.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the given data and the example, the Net Cash Ratio is calculated as the absolute value of the ratio of Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities to Net Profit. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '4.89'}}\n```",
