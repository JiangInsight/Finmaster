                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate two key metrics: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Metrics\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This measures how much out of every dollar of sales a company retains as gross profit. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This assesses a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operations. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   A negative ratio here might indicate that the company isn't generating enough cash from operations to cover its current liabilities, which could be a concern.\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$16,388,736.33\n- Gross Profit: \\$4,788,736.33\n\nFrom the **cash flow statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$6,316,405.44\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (end of period):\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$4,319,436.82\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{4,788,736.33}{16,388,736.33} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{4,788,736.33}{16,388,736.33} \\approx 0.2922\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.2922 \\times 100 \\approx 29.22\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **29.22%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-6,316,405.44}{4,319,436.82}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{-6,316,405.44}{4,319,436.82} \\approx -1.462\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **-1.46**.\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make any mistakes:\n- For Gross Profit Margin: \\$4,788,736.33 / \\$16,388,736.33 is indeed about 0.2922 or 29.22%.\n- For Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -\\$6,316,405.44 / \\$4,319,436.82 is about -1.46.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '29.22%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.46'}}\n```",
