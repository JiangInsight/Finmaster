                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,290,835.16\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 4,319,436.82 / 29,290,835.16 ≈ 0.1475\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,290,835.16\n- Total Revenue = 16,388,736.33\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (1,290,835.16 / 16,388,736.33) * 100 ≈ 7.876%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:**  \nROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 33,610,271.98\n- Net Profit = 1,290,835.16\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (1,290,835.16 / 33,610,271.98) * 100 ≈ 3.840%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no cash sales are mentioned), Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 16,388,736.33\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (from initial balance) = 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 6,408,987.07\nAverage = (0 + 6,408,987.07) / 2 = 3,204,493.535\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 16,388,736.33 / 3,204,493.535 ≈ 5.113\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Net Profit Margin': '7.88%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '3.84%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.11'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 4,319,436.82 / 29,290,835.16 ≈ 0.1475 → \"0.15\" is correct when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - 1,290,835.16 / 16,388,736.33 ≈ 0.07876 → 7.876% → \"7.88%\" is correct when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n3. **ROA:**\n   - 1,290,835.16 / 33,610,271.98 ≈ 0.03840 → 3.840% → \"3.84%\" is correct when rounded to two decimal places.\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:**\n   - 16,388,736.33 / 3,204,493.535 ≈ 5.113 → \"5.11\" is correct when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nEverything checks out! The final JSON is accurate based on the provided data.",
