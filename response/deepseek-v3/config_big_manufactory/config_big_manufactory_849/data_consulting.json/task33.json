                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of the required ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each calculation step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,316,405.44\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ -1.46\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities are the current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable), as there are no long-term liabilities mentioned. So:\nTotal Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -6,316,405.44 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ -1.46\n\n*Note: This is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio in this case because total debt equals current liabilities.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 11,600,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Ending Inventory = 5,600,000.00\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00 (from Initial_amount)\n\nAverage Inventory = (Initial Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (0 + 5,600,000) / 2 = 2,800,000\n\nCalculation:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 11,600,000 / 2,800,000 ≈ 4.14\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nTotal Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\nFrom the balance sheet:\nTotal Owner's Equity (End_amount) = 29,290,835.16\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 4,319,436.82 / 29,290,835.16 ≈ 0.15\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 23,990,150.22\n- Inventory = 5,600,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n\nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory = 23,990,150.22 - 5,600,000 = 18,390,150.22\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 18,390,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 4.26\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 23,990,150.22\n- Current Liabilities = 4,319,436.82\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 23,990,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 5.55\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.46', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.46', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '4.14', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Quick Ratio': '4.26', 'Current Ratio': '5.55'}}\n```\n\n*Note: Some ratios like Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Cash Flow to Debt Ratio are negative due to negative operating cash flow, which indicates that the company's operating activities are consuming cash rather than generating it during this period.*",
