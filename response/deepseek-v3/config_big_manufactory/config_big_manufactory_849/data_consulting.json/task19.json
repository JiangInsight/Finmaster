                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate both the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Current Ratio measures a company's ability to pay its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount): 23,990,150.22\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 4,319,436.82\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{23,990,150.22}{4,319,436.82} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n23,990,150.22 ÷ 4,319,436.82 ≈ 5.555\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately 5.56.\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Current Ratio was given as 4.27, and the numbers were smaller. Here, our current assets are much larger relative to current liabilities, so a higher ratio makes sense.\n\n### 2. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Inventory Turnover Ratio measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} \\]\n\n**From the Financial Statements:**\n- Cost of Goods Sold (from Income Statement): 11,600,000.00\n- Beginning Inventory (Initial_amount from Balance Sheet): 0.00\n- Ending Inventory (End_amount from Balance Sheet): 5,600,000.00\n\n**Calculating Average Inventory:**\n\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{0 + 5,600,000}{2} = 2,800,000 \\]\n\n**Calculating Inventory Turnover Ratio:**\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{11,600,000}{2,800,000} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n11,600,000 ÷ 2,800,000 ≈ 4.142\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately 4.14.\n\n*Again, comparing to the example*, their ratio was 1.73 with COGS of 4,410,000 and average inventory around 2,545,000 (since beginning was 0 and ending was 5,090,000). Here, our COGS is higher relative to average inventory, so a higher turnover ratio makes sense.\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\n**Current Ratio:**\n- Current Assets: 23,990,150.22\n- Current Liabilities: 4,319,436.82\n- 23,990,150.22 / 4,319,436.82 ≈ 5.555 (correct)\n\n**Inventory Turnover:**\n- COGS: 11,600,000\n- Beginning Inventory: 0\n- Ending Inventory: 5,600,000\n- Average Inventory: (0 + 5,600,000)/2 = 2,800,000\n- 11,600,000 / 2,800,000 = 4.142 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '5.56', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '4.14'} }\n```\n\n*However*, looking back at the example's format, the ratios were presented with two decimal places but not necessarily rounded. Here, our calculations are precise to two decimal places without rounding, so it's accurate as is.\n\nBut let's see if we can be more precise with the Current Ratio:\n\n23,990,150.22 ÷ 4,319,436.82 ≈ 5.5547... which rounds to 5.55.\n\nSimilarly, Inventory Turnover:\n\n11,600,000 ÷ 2,800,000 = 4.142857..., which rounds to 4.14.\n\nSo, adjusting slightly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '5.55', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '4.14'} }\n```\n\nBut 5.555... is closer to 5.56 when rounded to two decimal places. So, initial was correct.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most accurate representations are:\n\n- Current Ratio: 5.56\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 4.14\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '5.56', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '4.14'} }\n```",
