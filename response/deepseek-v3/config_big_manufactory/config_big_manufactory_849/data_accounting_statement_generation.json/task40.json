                        "content": "To calculate the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" for the cash flow statement, we need to analyze the inventory changes based on the purchases and sales transactions provided in the data. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Purchase Transactions\nFirst, we need to sum up all the purchase transactions that affect inventory. These are transactions where the \"type\" is \"Purchase\" and they have a \"product_id\" indicating inventory items.\n\nFrom the data, the purchase transactions are:\n1. Purchase20231231001: $1,500,000 (P004 - Heavy Equipment D)\n2. Purchase20231231002: $500,000 (P001 - Heavy Equipment A)\n3. Purchase20231231003: $1,600,000 (P002 - Heavy Equipment B)\n4. Purchase20231231004: $3,000,000 (P004 - Heavy Equipment D) [Unpaid]\n5. Purchase20231231005: $1,000,000 (P003 - Heavy Equipment C)\n6. Purchase20231231006: $2,000,000 (P003 - Heavy Equipment C)\n7. Purchase20231231007: $1,000,000 (P001 - Heavy Equipment A)\n8. Purchase20231231008: $1,600,000 (P002 - Heavy Equipment B)\n9. Purchase20231231009: $1,000,000 (P001 - Heavy Equipment A)\n10. Purchase20231231010: $500,000 (P001 - Heavy Equipment A)\n11. Purchase20231231011: $500,000 (P001 - Heavy Equipment A) [Unpaid]\n12. Purchase20231231012: $1,500,000 (P004 - Heavy Equipment D)\n13. Purchase20231231013: $500,000 (P001 - Heavy Equipment A)\n14. Purchase20231231014: $1,000,000 (P003 - Heavy Equipment C)\n\nTotal Purchases (including unpaid): \n$1,500,000 + $500,000 + $1,600,000 + $3,000,000 + $1,000,000 + $2,000,000 + $1,000,000 + $1,600,000 + $1,000,000 + $500,000 + $500,000 + $1,500,000 + $500,000 + $1,000,000 = $16,200,000\n\nHowever, for the cash flow statement, we only consider paid purchases (since unpaid purchases do not affect cash flow). The unpaid purchases are:\n- Purchase20231231004: $3,000,000\n- Purchase20231231011: $500,000\n\nTotal Paid Purchases: $16,200,000 - $3,000,000 - $500,000 = $12,700,000\n\n### Step 2: Identify Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) from Sales\nNext, we sum up the \"cost_amount\" from sales transactions, which represents the inventory sold (COGS).\n\nFrom the data, the sales transactions with COGS are:\n1. Sale20240106004: $500,000 (P001)\n2. Sale20240108006: $1,500,000 (P004)\n3. Sale20240111008: $800,000 (P002)\n4. Sale20240114010: $500,000 (P001)\n5. Sale20240119016: $1,000,000 (P003)\n6. Sale20240122019: $500,000 (P001)\n7. Sale20240123021: $800,000 (P002)\n8. Sale20240124022: $500,000 (P001)\n9. Sale20240125024: $1,500,000 (P004)\n10. Sale20240126025: $500,000 (P001)\n11. Sale20240130031: $1,000,000 (P003)\n12. Sale20240131033: $500,000 (P001)\n13. Sale20240202035: $500,000 (P001)\n14. Sale20240204038: $1,500,000 (P004)\n\nTotal COGS: \n$500,000 + $1,500,000 + $800,000 + $500,000 + $1,000,000 + $500,000 + $800,000 + $500,000 + $1,500,000 + $500,000 + $1,000,000 + $500,000 + $500,000 + $1,500,000 = $11,600,000\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Net Change in Inventory\nThe net change in inventory is calculated as:\n(Total Purchases - Total COGS) = ($12,700,000 - $11,600,000) = $1,100,000\n\nSince inventory increased (more purchases than COGS), this is represented as a negative value in the cash flow statement (cash outflow).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-1100000.00'}}\n```",
