Depreciation is typically recorded as an expense in the income statement and is listed under transactions with the type \"Depreciation\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Depreciation Transactions**: \n   - Look for all transactions where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\".\n   - In the given data, there are two such transactions:\n     - `Depreciation20240101001` with an amount of `45745.880000000005`\n     - `Depreciation20240201002` with an amount of `60147.44`\n\n2. **Determine the Final Depreciation Item**:\n   - The task asks for the \"final\" depreciation item in the income statement. This implies we should consider the most recent depreciation entry.\n   - The most recent depreciation entry is `Depreciation20240201002` with an amount of `60147.44`.\n\n3. **Format the Answer**:\n   - The depreciation amount should be presented as a string in the specified JSON format.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '60147.44'}}\n```",
