Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Fixed Assets Value**: \n   - Look for transactions with type \"Fixed Assets\" and date \"2023-12-31\". This represents the initial value of fixed assets.\n   - In the given data, there is one such transaction with an amount of 8,000,000.00.\n\n2. **Identify Fixed Assets Purchases**:\n   - Look for transactions with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or any purchases that might be categorized as fixed assets (e.g., heavy equipment, machinery, etc.).\n   - In the given data, there is one transaction with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" and amount 839,853.83.\n\n3. **Calculate Final Fixed Assets Value**:\n   - The final value of fixed assets is the sum of the initial fixed assets and any additional fixed assets purchased during the period.\n   - Initial Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n   - Fixed Assets Purchase: 839,853.83\n   - Final Fixed Assets = 8,000,000.00 + 839,853.83 = 8,839,853.83\n\n4. **Depreciation**:\n   - Depreciation reduces the value of fixed assets over time. In the given data, there are depreciation entries, but since we are calculating the gross fixed assets (before depreciation), we do not subtract depreciation here. If we were calculating net fixed assets, we would subtract accumulated depreciation.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - Initial Fixed Assets Value: 8,000,000.00\n   - Final Fixed Assets Value: 8,839,853.83\n\nHere is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '8839853.83'}}\n```",
