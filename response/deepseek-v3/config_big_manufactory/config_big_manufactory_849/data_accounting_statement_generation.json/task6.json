Current assets typically include cash, bank deposits, accounts receivable, and other assets that are expected to be converted into cash within a year. Fixed assets and other non-current assets are excluded from this calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Current Assets:**\n   - From the initial transactions on 2023-12-31, we have:\n     - Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0\n     - Bank deposit: 15,000,000.0\n   - Fixed assets (8,000,000.0) are not included in current assets.\n   - **Total Initial Current Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits = 5,000,000.0 + 15,000,000.0 = 20,000,000.0**\n\n2. **Calculate Changes to Current Assets:**\n   - **Cash Outflows:**\n     - Expenses paid in cash (all expenses marked as \"Paid\" with payment method \"Cash\"):\n       - 2024-01-01: 79,714.42 (Sales Expenses)\n       - 2024-01-02: 51,825.36 (Financial Expenses) + 46,725.01 (Administrative Expenses)\n       -
