Depreciation is a non-cash expense that reduces the value of fixed assets over time and is recorded in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are to find the depreciation amount from the transactions data provided. This amount is typically listed under transactions with the type \"Depreciation\".\n\n2. **Review the Transactions Data**: Look through the transactions to find any entries where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\". \n\n3. **Locate the Depreciation Entry**: \n   - In the given data, there is a transaction with the ID \"Depreciation20240201002\" and type \"Depreciation\".\n   - The amount for this transaction is listed as \"60147.44\".\n\n4. **Verify the Entry**: \n   - Ensure that this is indeed the depreciation expense by checking the type and the context (it's a non-cash expense affecting the cash flow statement).\n   - There are no other depreciation entries in the provided data, so this is the only relevant entry.\n\n5. **Extract the Depreciation Amount**: \n   - The amount for the depreciation entry is \"60147.44\".\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: \n   - Present the answer in the required JSON format with the depreciation amount.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '60147.44'} }\n```",
