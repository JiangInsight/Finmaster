Purchase20231231004:\n   - Amount: 3,000,000.00\n   - Payment Status: Unpaid\n   - Payment Method: Account Payable\n\n2. Purchase20231231011:\n   - Amount: 500,000.00\n   - Payment Status: Unpaid\n   - Payment Method: Account Payable\n\nThese are the only two transactions that contribute to the accounts payable balance at the end of the period. \n\nThe total increase in accounts payable is the sum of these amounts:\n3,000,000.00 + 500,000.00 = 3,500,000.00\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '3500000.00'} }\n```",
