In the given data, fixed asset purchases are typically recorded with the type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or similar. \n\nLooking at the provided data, we can see the following relevant transaction:\n\n1. **FixedAsset20231231001**: This transaction is labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" with an amount of 886,161.25.\n2. **FixedAsset20231231001**: Another transaction labeled as \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" with an amount of 839,853.83.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the second transaction (839,853.83) appears to be the only one that is explicitly labeled as a fixed asset purchase in the given data. The first one (886,161.25) might be a duplicate or mislabeled, but based on the structure of the data, the correct fixed asset purchase is the one with the amount 839,853.83.\n\nThus, the final purchase of fixed assets is 839,853.83.\n\nHere is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '839853.83'}}\n```",
