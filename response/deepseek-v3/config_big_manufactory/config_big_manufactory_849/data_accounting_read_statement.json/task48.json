In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit\".\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\nFrom the given problem, we can locate these two line items and their corresponding amounts:\n\n- **Net Profit**: 1290835.16\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 1726015.08\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1290835.16', 'value2': '1726015.08'} }\n```",
