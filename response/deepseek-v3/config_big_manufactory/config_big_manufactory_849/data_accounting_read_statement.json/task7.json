This represents the total depreciation expense accumulated over time for fixed assets.\n\n2. **Extract the initial and end values**:\n   - **Initial value**: The initial amount for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `0.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End value**: The end amount for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `105893.32` as of the end date `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify the context**: Since \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is the only line item that directly relates to an expense (depreciation expense), it is the correct item to extract.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '105893.32'} }\n```",
