I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable,\" which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n\nThe order to present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Capital Contributed by Shareholders\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided, we have:\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 28000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 28000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis indicates that the capital contributed by shareholders is `28000000.00`. There's no change during the period, but the initial and end amounts are the same, which is the value we're interested in.\n\n**Value1: '28000000.00'**\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Profit Before Tax\nFrom the Income Statement:\n```\nProfit Before Tax | 2110271.98 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis is the profit before any tax expense is deducted.\n\n**Value2: '2110271.98'**\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Increase in Accounts Payable\nIn the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable | 3500000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThis shows that the amount owed by the entity for goods/services on credit (Accounts Payable) increased by `3500000.00` during the period.\n\n**Value3: '3500000.00'**\n\n### Verifying the Values\nLet me double-check each to ensure accuracy:\n- **Paid-in Capital**: Confirmed as `28000000.00` in Balance Sheet.\n- **Profit Before Tax**: Confirmed as `2110271.98` in Income Statement.\n- **Increase in Accounts Payable**: Confirmed as `3500000.00` in Cash Flow Statement.\n\nAll values are correctly identified from their respective statements.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '2110271.98', 'value3': '3500000.00'} }\n```",
