Additionally, we need to decompose this item into 1 component sub-item, all of which must also originate from the input statement. \n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Total Income from Ordinary Activities**: \n   - The total income from ordinary activities is typically represented by \"Total Revenue\" in the income statement. \n   - In the given problem, \"Total Revenue\" is listed with an amount of \"16388736.33\".\n\n2. **Identify Constituent Line Items**:\n   - The constituent line item that makes up the \"Total Revenue\" is \"Main Business Revenue\", which is also listed with the same amount of \"16388736.33\". This indicates that \"Main Business Revenue\" is the sole component of \"Total Revenue\" in this case.\n\n3. **Decompose Total Revenue into 1 Sub-Item**:\n   - The sub-item to be extracted is \"Main Business Revenue\", which has the same initial and final value as \"Total Revenue\" since it is the only component.\n\n4. **Extract Values**:\n   - The value of \"Total Revenue\" is \"16388736.33\".\n   - The sub-item value is also \"16388736.33\" (from \"Main Business Revenue\").\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '16388736.33', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '16388736.33'} }\n```",
