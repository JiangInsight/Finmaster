I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task is about analyzing a cash flow statement to extract specific information related to cash flows from investing activities. Here's what we need to do:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents from Investing Activities**: This is the total cash generated or used in investing activities.\n2. **Decompose this Item into 1 Component Sub-item**: This means we need to find one specific line item that contributes to the net cash flow from investing activities.\n3. **Output the Final Values**: Provide the net amount and the value of the sub-item.\n\n### Given Data\n\nHere's the cash flow statement provided:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 1290835.16 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 105893.32 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -6408987.07 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -23583.67 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -5600000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 3500000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 819436.82 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -6316405.44 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 1726015.08 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -1726015.08 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 20000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 11957579.48 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -8042420.52 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Step 1: Identify Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nFrom the table, the line item \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is clearly listed with an amount of `-1726015.08`. This is the total net amount generated from investing activities.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose into 1 Sub-item\n\nThe task mentions that this net amount should be decomposed into 1 component sub-item. Looking at the investing activities section, there's only one line item listed under it:\n\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": `1726015.08`\n\nThis is the only sub-item contributing to the net cash flow from investing activities. \n\nThe net cash flow is negative, indicating that cash was used in investing activities, which aligns with the purchase of fixed assets (an outflow).\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Calculation\n\nLet's check how the net cash flow from investing activities is calculated:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = Sum of all investing activities cash flows\n\nHere, the only activity is the purchase of fixed assets, which is an outflow (hence negative in cash flow terms):\n\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: `-1726015.08` (but in the table, it's listed as positive, which might be a presentation choice where outflows are listed as positive amounts and then summed negatively)\n\nGiven that the net is `-1726015.08`, and the purchase is `1726015.08`, it implies:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = - (Purchase of Fixed Assets) = -1726015.08\n\nThis checks out.\n\n### Step 4: Prepare the Solution\n\nNow, we need to present the solution in the specified JSON format:\n\n- 'value': Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = `-1726015.08`\n- 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': Purchase of Fixed Assets = `1726015.08`}\n\nHowever, looking at the example provided, the 'sub_items' is a dictionary with the key being 'sub_item value'. So, we'll follow that format.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1726015.08', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '1726015.08'}}}\n```\n\n### Verification with Example\n\nLooking back at the example given:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-305354.43', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '305354.43'}}}\n```\n\nThis matches our structure where the net cash flow from investing is negative, and the sub-item (purchase of fixed assets) is positive. Our solution follows the same pattern.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the cash flow statement and understanding the components, the solution is correctly derived as shown above. The net cash flow from investing activities is `-1726015.08`, and its sole component is the purchase of fixed assets amounting to `1726015.08`.",
