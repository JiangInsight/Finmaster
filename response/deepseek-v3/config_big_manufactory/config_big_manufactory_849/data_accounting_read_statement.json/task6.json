These items are typically categorized as \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the balance sheet provided, the line item that represents tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets.\"\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value and Date**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is `8000000.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value and Date**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is `9726015.08` as of the end date `2024-02-05`.\n\n4. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial and end values are directly taken from the \"Fixed Assets\" line in the balance sheet, ensuring accuracy.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9726015.08'} }\n```",
