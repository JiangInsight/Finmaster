COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is present with an amount of \"11600000.00\" and a date of \"2024-02-05.\"\n\n3. **Verify the Line Item**: The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is indeed the correct line item that represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period. \n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"11600000.00.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '11600000.00'}}\n```",
