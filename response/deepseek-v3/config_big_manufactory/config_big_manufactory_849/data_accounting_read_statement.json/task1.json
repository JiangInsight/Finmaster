This typically includes \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" as these are the most liquid assets readily available for operational use.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**:\n   - **Cash on Hand**: This is physical cash available to the entity.\n   - **Bank Deposits**: These are funds held in bank accounts that can be accessed for daily operations.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Values**:\n   - **Cash on Hand Initial Amount**: 5,000,000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - **Bank Deposits Initial Amount**: 15,000,000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - **Total Initial Cash Available**: 5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 = 20,000,000.00\n\n3. **Extract End Values**:\n   - **Cash on Hand End Amount**: 9,383,594.56 (as of 2024-02-05)\n   - **Bank Deposits End Amount**: 2,573,984.92 (as of 2024-02-05)\n   - **Total End Cash Available**: 9,383,594.56 + 2,573,984.92 = 11,957,579.48\n\n4. **Verify Against Total Current Assets**:\n   - The sum of initial cash (20,000,000.00) matches the \"Total Current Assets\" initial amount, confirming these are the correct line items.\n   - The sum of end cash (11,957,579.48) does not match the \"Total Current Assets\" end amount (23,990,150.22), which is expected because \"Total Current Assets\" includes other items like accounts receivable and inventory.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value of cash available for day-to-day operations is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" initial amounts: 20,000,000.00.\n   - The end value of cash available for day-to-day operations is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" end amounts: 11,957,579.48.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '20000000.00', 'end value': '11957579.48'} }\n```",
