A negative value indicates an increase in inventory (which is a use of cash), while a positive value would indicate a decrease in inventory (a source of cash). \n\nLooking at the provided problem, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" has a value of \"-5600000.00\". This negative value indicates an increase in inventory, which corresponds to a reduction in cash flow from operating activities due to more assets being held for sale or in production.\n\nThus, the value to be extracted is \"-5600000.00\".\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-5600000.00'}}\n```",
