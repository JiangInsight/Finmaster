The \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section typically includes the \"Beginning Balance\" (cash at the start of the period), \"Ending Balance\" (cash at the end of the period), and \"Net Increase\" (the change in cash during the period).\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, the \"Beginning Balance\" represents the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period. This is the value we need to extract.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: From the provided table, under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, the \"Beginning Balance\" is listed as \"20000000.00\" on the date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n### Solution:\nThe value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is \"20000000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20000000.00'} }\n```",
