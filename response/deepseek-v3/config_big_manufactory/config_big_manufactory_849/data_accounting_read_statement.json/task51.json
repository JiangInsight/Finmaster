This account records the interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: This is the value at the beginning of the period (Initial_amount in the balance sheet).\n   - **End Value**: This is the value at the end of the period (End_amount in the balance sheet).\n\n3. **Extract the Values**:\n   - From the balance sheet provided, the \"Interest Receivable\" account has:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 23583.67 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n4. **Verify with Other Statements**:\n   - The cash flow statement shows a line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" with a value of -23583.67, which matches the change in the \"Interest Receivable\" account (from 0.00 to 23583.67).\n   - The income statement shows \"Interest Income\" of 23583.67, which is the amount of interest earned during the period and matches the end value of \"Interest Receivable\" (since the initial value was 0.00).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '23583.67'} }\n```",
