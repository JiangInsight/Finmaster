I'm going to break it down to understand how to find the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, and then identify its two component sub-items from the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's recall what a cash flow statement shows. It provides information about the cash inflows and outflows of a company during a specific period, categorized into three main activities:\n1. **Operating Activities**: Cash generated or used in the core business operations.\n2. **Investing Activities**: Cash used for or generated from investments like purchasing or selling assets.\n3. **Financing Activities**: Cash from or used in financing the business, like issuing stocks or paying dividends.\n\nHowever, in the given problem, the financing activities section isn't present, but we have the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section which shows the beginning and ending balances along with the net increase or decrease.\n\n### Identifying the Net Addition in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\" is essentially the change in cash from the beginning to the end of the period. This is directly given in the statement as \"Net Increase\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\nFrom the problem:\n- Beginning Balance: 20,000,000.00\n- Ending Balance: 11,957,579.48\n- Net Increase: -8,042,420.52\n\nSo, the net addition (which is actually a decrease here since it's negative) is -8,042,420.52.\n\n### Decomposing the Net Addition into Two Sub-items\n\nThe net increase or decrease in cash is calculated as:\n**Net Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance**\n\nTherefore, the two sub-items that make up the net addition are:\n1. **Beginning Balance**: The cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n2. **Ending Balance**: The cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period.\n\nFrom the statement:\n- Sub-item 1 (Beginning Balance): 20,000,000.00\n- Sub-item 2 (Ending Balance): 11,957,579.48\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nLet's verify:\nEnding Balance - Beginning Balance = Net Increase\n11,957,579.48 - 20,000,000.00 = -8,042,420.52\n\nThis matches the given \"Net Increase\" value, confirming our sub-items are correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-8042420.52\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value1\": \"20000000.00\", \"sub_item value2\": \"11957579.48\"}}}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Value (Net Increase)**: -8,042,420.52\n- **Sub-item 1 (Beginning Balance)**: 20,000,000.00\n- **Sub-item 2 (Ending Balance)**: 11,957,579.48\n\nThis breakdown correctly represents the net change in cash and cash equivalents along with its two constituent parts from the cash flow statement.",
