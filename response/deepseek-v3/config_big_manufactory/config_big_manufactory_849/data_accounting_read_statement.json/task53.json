This is typically reflected in the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item in the income statement, as COGS represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Information**: \n   - In the provided financial statements, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed in the income statement.\n   - From the income statement, we can see:\n     - `Cost of Goods Sold | 11600000.00 | 2024-02-05`\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: \n   - The balance sheet shows the inventory at the beginning and end of the period, but the actual amount sold is captured in the income statement under COGS.\n   - The cash flow statement also reflects changes in inventory, but this is more about the change in inventory levels rather than the amount sold.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is accurately represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" value in the income statement, which is `11600000.00`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '11600000.00'} }\n```",
