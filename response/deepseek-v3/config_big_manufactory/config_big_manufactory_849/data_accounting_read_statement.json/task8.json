This typically refers to \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the amounts owed to suppliers or vendors for goods or services received on credit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value and Date**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the \"Accounts Payable\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00\n     - Initial_date: 2023-12-31\n\n3. **Extract End Value and Date**:\n   - The \"Accounts Payable\" line also shows:\n     - End_amount: 3500000.00\n     - End_date: 2024-02-05\n\n4. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The task specifically asks for amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit, which is exactly what \"Accounts Payable\" represents. No other line items in the balance sheet fit this description (e.g., \"Taxes Payable\" is for taxes owed, not trade payables).\n\n5. **Prepare the Solution**:\n   - The initial value is '0.00' (as of 2023-12-31).\n   - The end value is '3500000.00' (as of 2024-02-05).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3500000.00'} }\n```",
