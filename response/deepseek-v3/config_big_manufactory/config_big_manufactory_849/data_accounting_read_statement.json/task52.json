This represents the amount of money shareholders have invested in the company in exchange for shares.\n\n2. **Locating the Line Item**: In the provided balance sheet, we look for the line item that corresponds to the capital contributed by shareholders. This is clearly labeled as \"Paid-in Capital\" in both the initial and end periods.\n\n3. **Extracting Initial Value**: The initial value of the \"Paid-in Capital\" is given as 28,000,000.00 as of the initial date (2023-12-31).\n\n4. **Extracting End Value**: The end value of the \"Paid-in Capital\" is also 28,000,000.00 as of the end date (2024-02-05). This indicates that there was no additional capital contributed by shareholders during this period.\n\n5. **Verification**: To ensure accuracy, we cross-check the \"Paid-in Capital\" values in the balance sheet under both the initial and end periods. Both values are consistent at 28,000,000.00, confirming no changes during the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '28000000.00', 'end value': '28000000.00'}}\n```",
