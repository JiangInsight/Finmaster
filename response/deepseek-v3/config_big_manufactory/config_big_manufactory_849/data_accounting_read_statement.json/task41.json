In cash flow statements, this is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided problem, we look for the line item related to tax payable. The line item is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of \"819436.82\".\n3. **Verify the Context**: The amount is positive, indicating an increase in tax payable (i.e., tax accrued but not yet paid). This matches the description of the task.\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value to be extracted is \"819436.82\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '819436.82'} }\n```",
