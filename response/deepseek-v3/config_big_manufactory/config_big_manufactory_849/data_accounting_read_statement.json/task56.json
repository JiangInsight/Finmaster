This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify Depreciation in the Balance Sheet**: \n   - In the balance sheet, look for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" under the \"Fixed Assets\" section. The \"End_amount\" for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `105893.32` as of `2024-02-05`. This represents the total depreciation accumulated up to that date.\n\n2. **Identify Depreciation in the Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - In the cash flow statement, there is a line item \"Depreciation\" under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" with a value of `105893.32`. This represents the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n3. **Identify Depreciation in the Income Statement**: \n   - In the income statement, there is a line item \"Depreciation\" under expenses with a value of `105893.32`. This confirms the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe value of the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life (depreciation) is consistently reported as `105893.32` across all relevant sections of the financial statements.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '105893.32'}}\n```",
