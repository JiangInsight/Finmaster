These are typically the current assets.\n\nFrom the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. \n\nHere are the steps to identify the required values:\n\n1. **Identify the line item for Total Current Assets**: In the given balance sheet, \"Total Current Assets\" is listed with an initial amount and an end amount.\n2. **Extract the initial value**: The initial value of \"Total Current Assets\" is 20000000.00 as of the initial date 2023-12-31.\n3. **Extract the end value**: The end value of \"Total Current Assets\" is 23990150.22 as of the end date 2024-02-05.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '20000000.00', 'end value': '23990150.22'} }\n```",
