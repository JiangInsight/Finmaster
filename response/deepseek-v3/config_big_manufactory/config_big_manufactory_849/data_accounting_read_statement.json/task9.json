This involves looking for the \"Taxes Payable\" account, which represents the taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The balance sheet includes a line item labeled \"Taxes Payable\" under the \"Current Liabilities\" section. This is the account that represents taxes accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is listed as \"0.00\" with the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\". This means that at the beginning of the period (initial date), there were no taxes accrued but not yet paid.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is listed as \"819436.82\" with the \"End_date\" of \"2024-02-05\". This means that by the end of the period (end date), the company had accrued taxes of 819,436.82 that were not yet paid.\n\n4. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value is correctly \"0.00\" as no taxes were payable at the start.\n   - The end value is correctly \"819436.82\" as this is the amount of taxes payable at the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '819436.82'} }\n```",
