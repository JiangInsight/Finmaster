I'm going to break down the task to understand what each of the four values we need to extract represents, and then locate them in the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract four specific line items from the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is commonly known as **Depreciation**. It's the method by which a company allocates the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life.\n\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This refers to changes in **Inventory**. An increase in inventory would mean cash is being used to buy more goods, while a decrease would mean cash is being freed up as inventory is sold.\n\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**. It includes cash spent on or received from buying or selling long-term assets like property, plant, and equipment, as well as investments.\n\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the **Net Increase (or decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents** for the period. It shows the overall change in the company's cash position from the beginning to the end of the period.\n\n### Locating the Values in the Given Statement\n\nNow, let's go through the provided cash flow statement to find these four items.\n\n1. **Depreciation**:\n   - Looking at the \"Operating Activities\" section, we see a line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with an amount of `105893.32`.\n\n2. **Change in Inventory**:\n   - Still in the \"Operating Activities\" section, there's a line \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with an amount of `-5600000.00`. \n   - The negative sign indicates an increase in inventory (since it's an \"increase\" in the context of the label), meaning cash was used to increase inventory.\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - In the \"Investing Activities\" section, there's a line \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with an amount of `-1726015.08`.\n   - This negative value suggests that more cash was spent on investing activities than was received.\n\n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, there's a line \"Net Increase\" with an amount of `-8042420.52`.\n   - This shows that overall, the company's cash decreased by this amount during the period.\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe task mentions that for multiple outputs, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the statement:\n\n- Depreciation appears first among our four items.\n- Then the change in Inventory.\n- Next is Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\n- Finally, Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents.\n\nThis matches the order in which we've identified them.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together, the four values are:\n\n1. Depreciation: `105893.32`\n2. Change in Inventory: `-5600000.00`\n3. Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: `-1726015.08`\n4. Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: `-8042420.52`\n\nIn the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '105893.32', 'value2': '-5600000.00', 'value3': '-1726015.08', 'value4': '-8042420.52'} }\n```",
