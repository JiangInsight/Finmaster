This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: The amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is recorded under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet and cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Check the Balance Sheet**: \n   - In the balance sheet provided, the \"Accounts Payable\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00\n     - End_amount: 3500000.00\n   - This indicates that the amount owed increased by 3,500,000.00 during the period.\n\n3. **Verify with the Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - In the cash flow statement, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" shows:\n     - Amount: 3500000.00\n   - This confirms that the amount owed increased by 3,500,000.00 during the period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 3,500,000.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3500000.00'}}\n```",
