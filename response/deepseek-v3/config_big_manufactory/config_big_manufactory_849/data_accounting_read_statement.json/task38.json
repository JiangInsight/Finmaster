                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line item and value that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Line Item**: The line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" indicates changes in the amounts owed by customers for goods or services sold on credit. A negative value here means an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., more amounts are owed to the entity), while a positive value would indicate a decrease (i.e., less amounts are owed to the entity).\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given problem, the line item is \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with an amount of \"-6408987.07.\"\n\n3. **Interpret the Value**: The negative value (-6408987.07) indicates an increase in accounts receivable, meaning that more amounts are owed to the entity compared to the previous period. However, the task asks for the \"decrease in amounts owed,\" which would be the opposite (a positive value). Since the value is negative, it does not represent a decrease but rather an increase. \n\n   - If the task is to extract the value regardless of its sign (i.e., the absolute change in amounts owed), then the value is \"-6408987.07.\"\n   - If the task is to extract only the value where there is a decrease (positive value), then there is no such value in this example. \n\n   Given the example provided in the task description, the solution extracted the negative value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable,\" so we will follow the same approach here.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value to extract is \"-6408987.07.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-6408987.07'}}\n```",
