                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in. \n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract the following three items from the income statement:\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities**: This typically refers to the revenue generated from the main business operations. In income statements, this is often labeled as \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue.\"\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold, commonly known as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the administrative expenses incurred in running the business, usually listed as \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\nLet's look at the provided income statement line by line:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 16388736.33 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 16388736.33 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 11600000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost | 11600000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit | 4788736.33 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 738427.41 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Selling Expenses | 1334099.97 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation | 105893.32 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses | 523627.32 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses | 2702048.02 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income | 23583.67 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 2110271.98 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense | 819436.82 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit | 1290835.16 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\n1. **Total income from ordinary activities**:\n   - Both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" are listed with the same amount of 16,388,736.33. \n   - \"Total Revenue\" is a more comprehensive term that includes all revenues, but since \"Main Business Revenue\" is specifically mentioned and matches \"Total Revenue,\" either could be considered. However, \"Total Revenue\" is more standard for total income from ordinary activities.\n   - **Selected Value**: 16,388,736.33 (\"Total Revenue\")\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold (Cost of Goods Sold)**:\n   - Directly listed as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with an amount of 11,600,000.00.\n   - **Selected Value**: 11,600,000.00\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration**:\n   - Listed as \"Administrative Expenses\" with an amount of 738,427.41.\n   - **Selected Value**: 738,427.41\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking at the provided example:\n- 'value1' was \"Main Business Revenue\" (5,431,018.59)\n- 'value2' was \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (4,410,000.00)\n- 'value3' was \"Administrative Expenses\" (1,425,164.20)\n\nThis confirms our approach is correct:\n1. First value is the main revenue.\n2. Second is COGS.\n3. Third is administrative expenses.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the above analysis, the extracted values are:\n- value1 (Total Revenue): '16388736.33'\n- value2 (Cost of Goods Sold): '11600000.00'\n- value3 (Administrative Expenses): '738427.41'\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16388736.33', 'value2': '11600000.00', 'value3': '738427.41'} }\n```",
