The end amount of this line item represents the interest that has been accrued but not yet received.\n\n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is typically found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Net Increase\" or a similar line item in the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section. This value represents the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet**:\n   - In the Balance Sheet provided, there is a line item \"Interest Receivable\" with an \"End_amount\" of `23583.67`. This is the interest accrued but not yet received.\n\n2. **Identify \"Net Increase\" in the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the Cash Flow Statement, under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, there is a line item \"Net Increase\" with an \"Amount\" of `-8042420.52`. This is the net addition (or reduction, if negative) in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n3. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - `value1` corresponds to the \"Interest Receivable\" end amount: `23583.67`.\n   - `value2` corresponds to the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents: `-8042420.52`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '23583.67', 'value2': '-8042420.52'}}\n```",
