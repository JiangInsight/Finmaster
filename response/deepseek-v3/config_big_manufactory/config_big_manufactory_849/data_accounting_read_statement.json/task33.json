The two line items we are interested in are:\n\n1. **Income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities**: This is typically the \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Revenue\" from the core operations of the business. In the given problem, it is labeled as \"Main Business Revenue\" with a value of \"16388736.33\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. In the given problem, it is labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with a value of \"11600000.00\".\n\nThese two line items are in order in the income statement, so we will maintain that order in the output.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **Identify the first line item (\"Main Business Revenue\")**: \n   - Line item: \"Main Business Revenue\"\n   - Value: \"16388736.33\"\n\n2. **Identify the second line item (\"Cost of Goods Sold\")**:\n   - Line item: \"Cost of Goods Sold\"\n   - Value: \"11600000.00\"\n\n3. **Construct the output JSON**:\n   - The output should be in the format `{'value1': '16388736.33', 'value2': '11600000.00'}`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16388736.33', 'value2': '11600000.00'}}\n```",
