These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and long-term investments.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually one year). In the given balance sheet, the non-current assets are represented by \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is given under \"Total Non-current Assets\" with the \"Initial_amount\" of \"8000000.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" \"2023-12-31.\"\n   - The end value of non-current assets is given under \"Total Non-current Assets\" with the \"End_amount\" of \"9620121.76\" as of the \"End_date\" \"2024-02-05.\"\n\n3. **Verify the Line Items**:\n   - The \"Fixed Assets\" line item shows an initial value of \"8000000.00\" and an end value of \"9726015.08,\" but this is before accounting for \"Accumulated Depreciation.\" The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item already accounts for depreciation (as seen by the difference between \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Total Non-current Assets\" end values), so it is the correct value to use for the end value.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9620121.76'} }\n```",
