                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one to understand how to compute them based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Liabilities:** This is the sum of all liabilities. In the given balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" we have:\n  - Taxes Payable: 1,015,922.54\n  - Accounts Payable: 0.00\n  - So, Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n- **Total Assets:** 30,858,088.75 (from \"Total Assets\" at the end of the period)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,015,922.54}{30,858,088.75} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{1,015,922.54}{30,858,088.75} \\approx 0.0329 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.033 or 3.3%. But since the example had it as '0.14', maybe it's rounded to two decimal places, so '0.03'.\n\nWait, let me check the example again. The example had:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Total Assets: 13,216,409.49\n- Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.1409, rounded to '0.14'\n\nSimilarly here, 1,015,922.54 / 30,858,088.75 ≈ 0.0329, so '0.03' seems correct.\n\nBut let's confirm if we're missing any liabilities. The balance sheet shows:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\n- No long-term liabilities listed, so that's it.\n\nSo, Debt to Asset Ratio = 0.03.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operations to the net income, indicating how much cash the company generates relative to its reported profits. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -18,924,462.44\n- Net Profit (which is Net Income): 1,842,166.21\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-18,924,462.44}{1,842,166.21} \\]\n\nThis gives:\n\\[ \\frac{-18,924,462.44}{1,842,166.21} \\approx -10.273 \\]\n\nHmm, this is a negative ratio, which doesn't make much sense in terms of interpretation, but mathematically that's the calculation. \n\nIn the example provided:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41 (negative divided by negative is positive)\n\nHere, we have negative cash flow and positive net income, so the ratio is negative. Maybe the absolute value is considered, but typically the sign matters.\n\nBut since the example had a positive ratio when both were negative, here one is negative and one is positive, so the ratio is negative. Maybe the correct interpretation is to take the absolute value, but that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in identifying the numbers. Let me double-check:\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -18,924,462.44\n- Net Profit: 1,842,166.21 (from the cash flow statement, matches income statement)\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct: -18,924,462.44 / 1,842,166.21 ≈ -10.27\n\nBut the example had a positive ratio when both were negative, so maybe the formula is absolute values or something else. Alternatively, maybe the ratio is supposed to be Net Income / Operating Cash Flow, but that's not standard.\n\nGiven that, and since the example shows Operating Cash Flow / Net Income, I'll stick with that, even if it's negative here.\n\nSo, Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = -10.27\n\nBut looking at the example's calculation:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Net Profit = -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 = 4.41\n\nSimilarly here: -18,924,462.44 / 1,842,166.21 = -10.27\n\nSo, the ratio is -10.27, but the example had a positive ratio when both were negative. Maybe the negative sign is ignored in the interpretation, but mathematically it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is supposed to be the other way around: Net Income / Operating Cash Flow, but that's not standard.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct ratio is -10.27, but if we follow the example's presentation, maybe it's absolute value, so '10.27'.\n\nBut the example had '4.41' which is the exact division, not absolute, since both were negative.\n\nGiven that, here one is negative and one is positive, so the ratio is negative. Maybe the answer is '-10.27', but since the example didn't have negative, maybe it's '10.27'.\n\nBut the standard is Operating Cash Flow / Net Income, so -10.27.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-10.27'}}\n```\n\nHowever, considering that ratios are often presented as positive and the example had a positive ratio when both numbers were negative, perhaps the intended interpretation is to take the absolute value or consider the magnitude. But based on the standard calculation, it's -10.27.\n\nAlternatively, if the formula is Net Income / Operating Cash Flow, then:\n\n1,842,166.21 / -18,924,462.44 ≈ -0.097, but that doesn't match the example's approach.\n\nGiven that, sticking with the initial calculation:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-10.27'}}\n```\n\nBut since the example had Operating Cash Flow / Net Income as positive when both were negative, maybe the answer here should be '10.27' (absolute value). \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the standard is to divide Operating Cash Flow by Net Income, and here it's negative, the answer is '-10.27'. \n\nUnless the ratio is defined to always be positive, in which case '10.27'.\n\nGiven the example, where both were negative and the ratio was positive, perhaps the ratio is |Operating Cash Flow| / |Net Income|, then:\n\n| -18,924,462.44 | / | 1,842,166.21 | = 18,924,462.44 / 1,842,166.21 ≈ 10.27\n\nSo, if that's the case, then '10.27'.\n\nGiven that, the most consistent with the example is '10.27'.\n\nSo, updating:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '10.27'}}\n```",
