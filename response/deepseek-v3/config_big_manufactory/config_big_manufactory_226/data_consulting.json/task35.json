                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 20,314,894.50\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 20,314,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ 20.00\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 5,718,450.67\n- Total Revenue = 20,318,450.67\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (5,718,450.67 / 20,318,450.67) * 100 ≈ 28.14%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 1,015,922.54\n- Total Assets = 30,858,088.75\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,015,922.54 / 30,858,088.75 ≈ 0.033 or 3.3%\n\nWait a minute, the initial example had a Debt to Asset Ratio of 0.14, which is 14%. Here, it seems very low because the company has almost no debt compared to its assets. Maybe I'm missing something. \n\nLooking back, the balance sheet shows:\n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity = 30,858,088.75\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,842,166.21\nSo, Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Total Owner's Equity = 30,858,088.75 - 29,842,166.21 = 1,015,922.54\n\nThis seems correct. So the ratio is indeed very low, around 3.3%.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,842,166.21\n- Total Revenue = 20,318,450.67\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (1,842,166.21 / 20,318,450.67) * 100 ≈ 9.07%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = -1,980,427.60 (negative, which is unusual)\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 385,137.69\n- Total Cash = -1,980,427.60 + 385,137.69 = -1,595,289.91\n- Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = -1,595,289.91 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ -1.57\n\nThis is negative, which indicates the company has negative cash compared to its current liabilities. This might be a concern.\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n**Formula:** Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -18,924,462.44\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -2,670,827.47\n\nCalculation:\nFCF = -18,924,462.44 + (-2,670,827.47) = -21,595,289.91\n\nAlternatively, the cash flow statement shows \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents as -21,595,289.91, which matches this.\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Profit = 1,842,166.21\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 30,858,088.75\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (1,842,166.21 / 30,858,088.75) * 100 ≈ 5.97%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '20.00', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.14%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '3.29%', 'Net Profit Margin': '9.07%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '-1.57', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-21595289.91', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '5.97%'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n- Current Ratio: 20.00 seems high, indicating strong liquidity.\n- Gross Profit Margin: 28.14% is reasonable for many businesses.\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 3.29% is very low, indicating minimal debt.\n- Net Profit Margin: 9.07% is positive, which is good.\n- Cash to Current Debt Ratio: Negative, which is unusual and concerning.\n- FCF: Negative, indicating cash outflow, which aligns with the negative net increase in cash.\n- ROA: 5.97% is a modest return on assets.\n\nEverything checks out based on the provided data. The negative cash position is notable but could be due to timing differences in cash flows.",
