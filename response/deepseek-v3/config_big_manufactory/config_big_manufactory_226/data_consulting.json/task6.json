I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I recall that the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. The formula for Net Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us a percentage that represents how much of each dollar earned by the company is profit.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\nFrom the provided income statement, I can see:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 20,318,450.67\n- **Net Profit**: 1,842,166.21\n\nThese are the two key numbers I need for the calculation.\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\nNow, plugging these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,842,166.21}{20,318,450.67} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,842,166.21}{20,318,450.67} \\approx 0.090665 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.090665 \\times 100 \\approx 9.0665\\% \\]\n\n### Rounding the Result\nThe example provided had the Net Profit Margin rounded to two decimal places, so I'll do the same:\n\n\\[ 9.0665\\% \\approx 9.07\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let's double-check:\n\n- 20,318,450.67 × 9.0665% ≈ 20,318,450.67 × 0.090665 ≈ 1,842,166.21\nThis matches the given Net Profit, so the calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 9.07%.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '9.07%'}}\n```",
