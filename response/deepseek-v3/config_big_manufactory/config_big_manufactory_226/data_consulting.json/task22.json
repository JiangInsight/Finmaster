                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis problem step by step. We need to calculate two key financial ratios: the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Quick Ratio (also known as the Acid-Test Ratio):**\n   - This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n   - Formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - **Quick Assets** typically include:\n     - Cash and cash equivalents\n     - Marketable securities\n     - Accounts receivable\n     - (Note: Inventory is excluded because it's not as liquid)\n   \n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n     \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements, let's extract the necessary information.\n\n#### Balance Sheet (End of Period - 2024-02-05):\n- **Current Assets:**\n  - Cash on Hand: -1,980,427.60\n  - Bank Deposits: 385,137.69\n  - Interest Receivable: 18,176.52\n  - Accounts Receivable: 12,792,007.89\n  - Inventory: 9,100,000.00\n  - Total Current Assets: 20,314,894.50\n- **Current Liabilities:**\n  - Accounts Payable: 0.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 1,015,922.54\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\n\n#### Income Statement:\n- Total Revenue: 20,318,450.67\n- Net Profit: 1,842,166.21\n\n### Calculating Quick Ratio\n\n**Step 1: Identify Quick Assets**\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n\nLet's add them up:\n- Cash on Hand: -1,980,427.60\n- Bank Deposits: 385,137.69\n- Interest Receivable: 18,176.52\n- Accounts Receivable: 12,792,007.89\n\nQuick Assets = (-1,980,427.60) + 385,137.69 + 18,176.52 + 12,792,007.89\n\nCalculating step by step:\n1. -1,980,427.60 + 385,137.69 = -1,595,289.91\n2. -1,595,289.91 + 18,176.52 = -1,577,113.39\n3. -1,577,113.39 + 12,792,007.89 = 11,214,894.50\n\nWait a minute, this seems off because the Total Current Assets are 20,314,894.50, and if we're excluding inventory (9,100,000), then Quick Assets should be 20,314,894.50 - 9,100,000 = 11,214,894.50, which matches our calculation. \n\nBut having negative cash on hand is unusual, but mathematically it's correct here.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Current Liabilities**\nTotal Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Quick Ratio**\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{11,214,894.50}{1,015,922.54} \\approx 11.04\n\\]\n\nHmm, this seems unusually high. Maybe I made a mistake in identifying quick assets. \n\nWait, is \"Cash on Hand\" negative? That's odd because cash can't be negative in reality, but in accounting, it might represent an overdraft or negative balance, which is a liability. \n\nPerhaps \"Cash on Hand\" negative should be treated differently. Maybe it's not part of quick assets if it's negative. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we should exclude it or consider it as zero for quick assets.\n\nBut strictly following the formula, negative cash is still cash, so it's included. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the negative cash is a mistake in the data. \n\nGiven that, let's proceed with the calculation as is: Quick Ratio = 11.04\n\nBut that seems too high; typically, a quick ratio above 1 is good, and this is way above. Maybe the current liabilities are understated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Cash on Hand\" negative should be subtracted, not added. \n\nWait, mathematically, adding a negative is subtraction. \n\nOriginal calculation:\nQuick Assets = (-1,980,427.60) + 385,137.69 + 18,176.52 + 12,792,007.89 = 11,214,894.50\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nGiven that, the quick ratio is indeed ~11.04.\n\nPerhaps the company has very high receivables and low current liabilities, leading to a high quick ratio.\n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\n\n**Step 1: Identify Net Profit and Total Revenue**\n- Net Profit: 1,842,166.21\n- Total Revenue: 20,318,450.67\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Net Profit Margin**\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,842,166.21}{20,318,450.67} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 9.07\\%\n\\]\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the quick assets:\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\nTotal Current Assets = 20,314,894.50\nInventory = 9,100,000.00\nQuick Assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory = 20,314,894.50 - 9,100,000 = 11,214,894.50\n\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\nQuick Ratio = 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ 11.04\n\nNet Profit Margin:\n1,842,166.21 / 20,318,450.67 ≈ 0.0907 → 9.07%\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- Quick Ratio: 11.04\n- Net Profit Margin: 9.07%\n\nHowever, the quick ratio seems unusually high, which might indicate that the company has a very high amount of liquid assets compared to its current liabilities, or possibly an error in interpreting the negative cash on hand. But based on the given data and standard definitions, the calculations are correct.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '11.04', 'Net Profit Margin': '9.07%'}}\n```",
