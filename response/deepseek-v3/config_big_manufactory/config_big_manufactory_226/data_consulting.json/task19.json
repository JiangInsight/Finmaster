                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate both the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Assets (End_amount)**: 20,314,894.50\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount)**: 1,015,922.54\n- **Inventory**:\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n  - End_amount: 9,100,000.00 (on 2024-02-05)\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 14,600,000.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{20,314,894.50}{1,015,922.54}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{20,314,894.50}{1,015,922.54} \\approx 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **20**.\n\n*Wait a minute*, that seems quite high. Let me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLooking back:\n- Current Assets: 20,314,894.50\n- Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\n\nDivision:\n20,314,894.50 ÷ 1,015,922.54 ≈ 20\n\nYes, that's correct. The company has significantly more current assets than current liabilities, leading to a high current ratio.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nFirst, find the Average Inventory:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 9,100,000}{2} = 4,550,000\n\\]\n\nNow, the Inventory Turnover Ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{14,600,000}{4,550,000}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{14,600,000}{4,550,000} \\approx 3.208\n\\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **3.21**.\n\n*Hmm*, but in the example provided, the Inventory Turnover Ratio was given as '1.73'. Maybe I'm missing something about how beginning inventory is considered. \n\nWait, in the example:\n- Beginning Inventory: 0\n- Ending Inventory: 5,090,000\n- COGS: 4,410,000\n- Average Inventory: (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000\n- Inventory Turnover: 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nAh, no, that doesn't match the given solution of 1.73. Let me see:\n\nGiven solution for example:\nInventory Turnover Ratio: '1.73'\n\nCalculating:\nCOGS: 4,410,000\nAverage Inventory: (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000\n4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.732\n\nYes, that matches. So my calculation method seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the problem to solve:\nCOGS: 14,600,000\nAverage Inventory: (0 + 9,100,000)/2 = 4,550,000\n14,600,000 / 4,550,000 ≈ 3.208\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately 3.21.\n\n### Verifying the Current Ratio\n\nIn the example:\nCurrent Assets: 7,956,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\nCurrent Ratio: 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.27\n\nWhich matches the given solution.\n\nFor the problem:\nCurrent Assets: 20,314,894.50\nCurrent Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\nCurrent Ratio: 20,314,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ 20\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- **Current Ratio**: 20,314,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ 20.00\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: 14,600,000 / 4,550,000 ≈ 3.21\n\nHowever, looking at the example, the ratios were presented with two decimal places as strings. So, I'll format them similarly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '20.00', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.21'}}\n```\n\nBut let me think if there's any other way to interpret the inventory turnover. Maybe the beginning inventory isn't zero? But the balance sheet shows initial inventory as 0.00, so it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inventory figures are not directly from the balance sheet, but from the cash flow statement's changes. In the cash flow:\n\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -9,100,000.00\n\nThis suggests that inventory increased by 9,100,000, implying ending inventory is 9,100,000 and beginning was 0, same as balance sheet.\n\nSo, no alternative interpretation seems necessary.\n\n### Possible Missteps\n\nInitially, I thought the high current ratio might be a mistake, but upon verification, it's correct given the numbers. The company has a very high level of current assets relative to current liabilities.\n\nSimilarly, the inventory turnover seems straightforward based on the given data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter careful calculation and verification:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '20.00', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.21'}}\n```",
