                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all revenue is credit sales) = Main Business Revenue = 20,318,450.67\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (from initial balance sheet)\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 12,792,007.89\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**  \n(0 + 12,792,007.89) / 2 = 6,396,003.945\n\n**Calculation:**  \n20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.945 ≈ 3.18\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -18,924,462.44\n- Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\n**Calculation:**  \n-18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ -18.63\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis seems to be the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided (both had the same value). So, it's likely the same calculation.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nSame as above: -18.63\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales = Total Revenue = 20,318,450.67\n- Beginning Total Assets = 28,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 30,858,088.75\n\n**Average Total Assets:**  \n(28,000,000 + 30,858,088.75) / 2 = 29,429,044.375\n\n**Calculation:**  \n20,318,450.67 / 29,429,044.375 ≈ 0.69\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54 (since no long-term liabilities are listed)\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = 29,842,166.21\n\n**Calculation:**  \n1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.034\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity, which seems correct. Here, Total Liabilities are only current liabilities (1,015,922.54), and Total Owner's Equity is 29,842,166.21.\n\nSo, 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.034, which rounds to 0.03 or 0.04 depending on precision. But the example had a higher ratio, so maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, in the balance sheet, Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity is 30,858,088.75, and Owner's Equity is 29,842,166.21, so Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Total Owner's Equity = 30,858,088.75 - 29,842,166.21 = 1,015,922.54, which matches the Current Liabilities. So seems correct.\n\nBut the example had Debt to Equity as 0.16, which is higher, maybe they included more liabilities. Here, it's just current liabilities, so seems correct at ~0.03.\n\nBut let me check the example:\n\nIn the example:\nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\nTotal Owner's Equity = 11,354,858.57\nDebt to Equity = 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16\n\nHere, similarly:\nTotal Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\nTotal Owner's Equity = 29,842,166.21\nSo, 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.034\n\nSo, seems correct at ~0.03.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.18', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-18.63', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-18.63', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.69', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover: 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.945 ≈ 3.18 ✔\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ -18.63 ✔\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities: Same as above ✔\n- Total Asset Turnover: 20,318,450.67 / 29,429,044.375 ≈ 0.69 ✔\n- Debt to Equity: 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.03 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
