                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how I arrive at the numbers.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -18,924,462.44\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{-18,924,462.44}{1,015,922.54} \\approx -18.63 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the ability of a company to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities are:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\nThere are no long-term liabilities mentioned, so Total Debt = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{-18,924,462.44}{1,015,922.54} \\approx -18.63 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute, this is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. That's because in this case, Total Debt equals Current Liabilities since there are no long-term debts. Is this correct?*\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, under liabilities, only \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\" are listed, both under Current Liabilities. No long-term debts are mentioned. So yes, Total Debt = Current Liabilities here.\n\nThus, both ratios are the same in this scenario.\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 14,600,000.00\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n- Ending Inventory = 9,100,000.00 (on 2024-02-05)\n\nAverage Inventory:\n\\[ \\frac{0 + 9,100,000}{2} = 4,550,000 \\]\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{14,600,000}{4,550,000} \\approx 3.21 \\]\n\n*Wait, but initial inventory is 0, which seems odd. Maybe the company didn't have inventory at the start? Or is it a new company? If initial is 0, then average is half of ending inventory.*\n\nAlternatively, sometimes if beginning inventory is 0, people might use ending inventory directly, but the standard is to average. Given that, I'll stick with 3.21.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares a company's total debt to its total equity. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom earlier:\n- Total Debt = 1,015,922.54\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,842,166.21\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{1,015,922.54}{29,842,166.21} \\approx 0.034 \\]\n\n*Hmm, this seems very low. Let me check the balance sheet again.*\n\nWait, Total Liabilities are only Current Liabilities here, which is 1,015,922.54. Equity is much larger, so the ratio is indeed small.\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = -1,980,427.60\n- Bank Deposits = 385,137.69\n- Interest Receivable = 18,176.52\n- Accounts Receivable = 12,792,007.89\nTotal Quick Assets = (-1,980,427.60) + 385,137.69 + 18,176.52 + 12,792,007.89\n= (-1,980,427.60) + 385,137.69 = -1,595,289.91\n+ 18,176.52 = -1,577,113.39\n+ 12,792,007.89 = 11,214,894.50\n\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{11,214,894.50}{1,015,922.54} \\approx 11.04 \\]\n\n*Wait, that seems very high. Maybe I shouldn't include negative cash on hand?*\n\nActually, cash on hand is negative, which is unusual but possible (overdraft). Including it gives us the above. Alternatively, if we exclude negative cash, quick assets would be:\n\nBank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable = 385,137.69 + 18,176.52 + 12,792,007.89 = 13,195,322.10\n\nThen:\n\\[ \\frac{13,195,322.10}{1,015,922.54} \\approx 12.99 \\]\n\nStill very high. Maybe the negative cash should be treated as zero in quick assets? But that's not standard. Probably best to include it as is, giving 11.04.\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 20,314,894.50\n- Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{20,314,894.50}{1,015,922.54} \\approx 20.00 \\]\n\n*Again, very high, but the numbers are what they are.*\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the summary:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-18.63', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-18.63', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.21', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Quick Ratio': '11.04', 'Current Ratio': '20.00'} }\n```\n\n*Reviewing the numbers:*\n\n- Operating Cash Flow and Cash Flow to Debt are the same due to no long-term debt.\n- Inventory Turnover is based on average inventory (beginning was 0).\n- Debt to Equity is very low because equity is much larger than debt.\n- Quick and Current Ratios are high because current assets are much larger than current liabilities, even with negative cash on hand.\n\nThis seems correct based on the provided data.",
