                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two things: the Free Cash Flow (FCF) and the Current Assets Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** This is the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. It's an important measure because it shows how efficient a company is at generating cash. The formula is:\n   - FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures (CapEx)\n   - From the cash flow statement, CapEx is usually represented by \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. The formula is:\n   - Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Current Assets\n   - Net Sales is the \"Main Business Revenue\" from the income statement.\n   - Average Current Assets = (Initial Current Assets + End Current Assets) / 2\n\n### Given Data\n\nLet's extract the necessary numbers from the provided financial statements.\n\n#### Balance Sheet:\n- **Initial Current Assets (2023-12-31):** 20,000,000.00\n- **End Current Assets (2024-02-05):** 20,314,894.50\n\n#### Cash Flow Statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -18,924,462.44\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets (CapEx):** 2,670,827.47\n\n#### Income Statement:\n- **Main Business Revenue (Net Sales):** 20,318,450.67\n\n### Calculating Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\nUsing the formula:\nFCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\nFCF = -18,924,462.44 - 2,670,827.47\nFCF = -21,595,289.91\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the cash flow statement, there's a line that says \"Net Increase\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" which is -21,595,289.91. That seems to match our FCF calculation. \n\nBut is \"Net Increase\" the same as FCF? Actually, FCF is typically calculated as Operating Cash Flow minus CapEx, which we did. The \"Net Increase\" in cash is the total change in cash, which includes operating, investing, and financing activities. But since we don't have financing activities here, and investing is just CapEx, it aligns.\n\nSo, FCF = -21,595,289.91\n\nBut in the example provided, the FCF was the \"Net Increase\" from the cash flow statement. Maybe the problem expects us to take the \"Net Increase\" as FCF directly. \n\nGiven that, let's confirm:\n- Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: -21,595,289.91\nThis is the same as our calculation, so it's consistent.\n\n### Calculating Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nFirst, calculate Average Current Assets:\nAverage Current Assets = (Initial Current Assets + End Current Assets) / 2\n= (20,000,000.00 + 20,314,894.50) / 2\n= 40,314,894.50 / 2\n= 20,157,447.25\n\nNow, Current Assets Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Current Assets\n= 20,318,450.67 / 20,157,447.25\n≈ 1.008\n\nWait, let's do the division more precisely:\n20,318,450.67 / 20,157,447.25 ≈ 1.0079 ≈ 1.01\n\nBut in the example, the ratio was rounded to two decimal places, so we'll do the same: 1.01\n\nBut let's double-check the calculation:\n20,318,450.67 / 20,157,447.25\n= 1.0079...\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 1.01\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the example provided:\n- FCF was the \"Net Increase\" from cash flow: -7,565,348.53\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio:\n  - Net Sales: 5,431,018.59\n  - Average Current Assets: (8,000,000 + 7,956,806.47) / 2 ≈ 7,978,403.235\n  - Ratio: 5,431,018.59 / 7,978,403.235 ≈ 0.68\n\nOur calculations seem consistent with the example's methodology.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-21595289.91', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '1.01'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**\n   - From the cash flow statement, the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents is -21,595,289.91.\n   - This represents the overall change in cash, which in this case is equivalent to FCF since it's derived from operating and investing activities (no financing activities are mentioned).\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio:**\n   - Net Sales (Main Business Revenue): 20,318,450.67\n   - Initial Current Assets: 20,000,000.00\n   - End Current Assets: 20,314,894.50\n   - Average Current Assets: (20,000,000 + 20,314,894.50) / 2 = 20,157,447.25\n   - Ratio: 20,318,450.67 / 20,157,447.25 ≈ 1.01\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n- FCF: -21,595,289.91\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 1.01",
