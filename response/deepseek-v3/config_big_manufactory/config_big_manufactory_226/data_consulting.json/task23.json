                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n   \n   Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio indicates a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It shows how many years it would take for the company to pay off its debt if it used all its operating cash flow for that purpose.\n   \n   Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   \n   Here, \"Total Debt\" can sometimes be interpreted as \"Total Liabilities,\" but in many contexts, especially when \"Total Debt\" isn't explicitly given, we might use \"Total Current Liabilities\" or \"Total Liabilities\" based on what's available. In our case, the balance sheet shows \"Total Current Liabilities\" and no long-term liabilities, so we'll use \"Total Current Liabilities\" as \"Total Debt.\"\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$20,318,450.67\n- Cost of Goods Sold: \\$14,600,000.00\n- Gross Profit: \\$5,718,450.67\n\nFrom the **cash flow statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$18,924,462.44\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$1,015,922.54\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{5,718,450.67}{20,318,450.67} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{5,718,450.67}{20,318,450.67} \\approx 0.2814\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.2814 \\times 100 \\approx 28.14\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **28.14%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-18,924,462.44}{1,015,922.54}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{-18,924,462.44}{1,015,922.54} \\approx -18.63\n\\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-18.63**.\n\n### Verifying the Approach\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was calculated as -3.90, and their Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities was -7,259,994.10 with Total Current Liabilities of 1,861,550.92. \n\nCalculating that:\n\\[\n\\frac{-7,259,994.10}{1,861,550.92} \\approx -3.90\n\\]\nThat matches their solution. \n\nIn our case:\n\\[\n\\frac{-18,924,462.44}{1,015,922.54} \\approx -18.63\n\\]\nThis seems correct based on the numbers.\n\nHowever, is \"Total Debt\" correctly represented by \"Total Current Liabilities\"? \n\nLooking at the balance sheet, there are no long-term liabilities listed; only \"Total Current Liabilities\" is present at \\$1,015,922.54. So, it seems appropriate to use this as \"Total Debt\" in this context.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating both ratios:\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin**: 28.14%\n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: -18.63\n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '28.14%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-18.63'}}\n```",
