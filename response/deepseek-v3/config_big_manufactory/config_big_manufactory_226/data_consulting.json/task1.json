                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Current Ratio as of the end of the reporting period based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Current Ratio\nFirst, I recall that the **Current Ratio** is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nSo, I need to find the values for Total Current Assets and Total Current Liabilities from the given balance sheet.\n\n### Identifying Total Current Assets\nLooking at the balance sheet, under the \"Account\" column, I see \"Total Current Assets\" with an \"End_amount\" of **20,314,894.50**. \n\n- **Total Current Assets = 20,314,894.50**\n\n### Identifying Total Current Liabilities\nSimilarly, under \"Account\", there's \"Total Current Liabilities\" with an \"End_amount\" of **1,015,922.54**.\n\n- **Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54**\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{20,314,894.50}{1,015,922.54} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n1. Divide 20,314,894.50 by 1,015,922.54.\n2. Performing the division: \n   - 1,015,922.54 goes into 20,314,894.50 approximately 20 times (since 1,015,922.54 * 20 = 20,318,450.80, which is close).\n   - But let's calculate it more precisely:\n     - 20,314,894.50 ÷ 1,015,922.54 ≈ 20.00\n\nWait, that seems too round. Maybe I should calculate it more accurately.\n\nLet me do the exact division:\n\n20,314,894.50 ÷ 1,015,922.54 ≈ 20.000 (approximately)\n\nBut looking at the numbers:\n\n1,015,922.54 * 20 = 20,318,450.80\n\nBut our numerator is 20,314,894.50, which is slightly less than 20,318,450.80.\n\nDifference: 20,318,450.80 - 20,314,894.50 = 3,556.30\n\nSo, it's slightly less than 20. \n\nLet's calculate more precisely:\n\n20,314,894.50 ÷ 1,015,922.54 ≈ 19.996\n\nBut in the example given, the ratio was rounded to two decimal places, so maybe we should do the same here.\n\nCalculating more accurately:\n\n20,314,894.50 ÷ 1,015,922.54 ≈ 19.996\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 20.00\n\nBut let's see if this makes sense compared to the example.\n\nIn the example:\n- Current Assets: 7,956,806.47\n- Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Ratio: 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.274 → rounded to 4.27\n\nSimilarly here:\n20,314,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ 19.996 → rounded to 20.00\n\nBut the example had more decimal places in the ratio, so maybe we should keep more precision.\n\nCalculating with more precision:\n\n20,314,894.50 ÷ 1,015,922.54 ≈ 19.9964\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 20.00\n\nBut the example had '4.27', which is two decimal places, so '20.00' seems correct.\n\nHowever, looking at the numbers, the ratio is very close to 20, so '20.00' seems accurate.\n\n### Verifying the Components\nJust to ensure I didn't miss anything, let's list out the current assets and current liabilities:\n\n**Current Assets:**\n- Cash on Hand: -1,980,427.60\n- Bank Deposits: 385,137.69\n- Interest Receivable: 18,176.52\n- Accounts Receivable: 12,792,007.89\n- Inventory: 9,100,000.00\n- **Total Current Assets: 20,314,894.50** (matches the given total)\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\n- Accounts Payable: 0.00\n- Taxes Payable: 1,015,922.54\n- **Total Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54** (matches the given total)\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{20,314,894.50}{1,015,922.54} \\approx 20.00 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '20.00'} }\n```",
