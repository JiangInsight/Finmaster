                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of debt a company uses to finance its assets relative to the value of shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (which is the total liabilities here since there are no non-current liabilities listed):** 1,015,922.54\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 29,842,166.21\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,015,922.54}{29,842,166.21} \\approx 0.034 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 0.03 or 3.4%. However, looking at the example, it seems they might have used more decimal places or rounded differently. But based on our calculation, it's 0.03.\n\nWait, let me check if I missed any liabilities. The balance sheet shows only \"Total Current Liabilities\" as 1,015,922.54, and no other liabilities are listed. So, total liabilities are indeed 1,015,922.54.\n\nCalculating:\n\n1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.034\n\nSo, '0.03' seems correct, but the example had more precision, so maybe '0.034' or '0.03'. Let's keep it as '0.03' for now.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 1,842,166.21\n- **Total Revenue:** 20,318,450.67\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,842,166.21}{20,318,450.67} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 9.07\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately '9.07%'.\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Assets:** 30,858,088.75\n- **Net Profit:** 1,842,166.21\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{1,842,166.21}{30,858,088.75} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 5.97\\% \\]\n\nSo, the ROA is approximately '5.97%'.\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects receivables from customers. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need the average accounts receivable. Since the initial amount is 0 and the end amount is 12,792,007.89, the average is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 12,792,007.89}{2} = 6,396,003.945 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{20,318,450.67}{6,396,003.945} \\approx 3.18 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately '3.18'.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, they might have used only the ending accounts receivable instead of the average. If we use only the ending amount:\n\n\\[ \\frac{20,318,450.67}{12,792,007.89} \\approx 1.59 \\]\n\nBut this seems low. Typically, the average is used when beginning and ending amounts are available. Given that the initial amount is 0, using the average might not be appropriate here because the company started with no receivables and ended with a large amount. Maybe using the ending amount is more realistic in this case, giving '1.59'. \n\nAlternatively, if the company had no receivables at the start, the average is half the ending amount, leading to a higher turnover ratio ('3.18'). \n\nGiven that the example used a similar scenario and got a higher ratio, perhaps they used the average. So, I'll go with '3.18'.\n\nBut let me think: if the initial is 0 and end is X, then average is X/2, so turnover is Revenue/(X/2) = 2*Revenue/X. \n\nSo, 2 * 20,318,450.67 / 12,792,007.89 ≈ 3.18.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, '3.18' is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nCombining all these:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.03\n- Net Profit Margin: 9.07%\n- ROA: 5.97%\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 3.18\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the ratios were presented with two decimal places for some and one for others. Let's format similarly:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: '0.03' (from 0.034)\n- Net Profit Margin: '9.07%'\n- ROA: '5.97%'\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: '3.18'\n\nBut the example had '0.16', '-30.29%', '-12.55%', '4.47', so maybe they rounded differently. For consistency, let's keep two decimal places where applicable.\n\nFinalizing:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '9.07%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '5.97%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.18'}}\n```\n\nWait, the Debt to Equity Ratio is very low at 0.03, which seems correct based on the numbers (low liabilities compared to high equity). \n\nBut let me double-check the Debt to Equity calculation:\n\nTotal Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\nTotal Equity: 29,842,166.21\n\n1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.034\n\nSo, '0.03' is correct when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nEverything else seems correctly calculated based on the formulas and data provided.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '9.07%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '5.97%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.18'}}\n```",
