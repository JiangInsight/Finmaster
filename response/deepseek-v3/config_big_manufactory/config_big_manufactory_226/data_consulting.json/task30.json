                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 20,314,894.50\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 20,314,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ 20.00\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = -1,980,427.60 (negative cash is unusual, but we'll proceed)\n- Bank Deposits = 385,137.69\n- Interest Receivable = 18,176.52\n- Accounts Receivable = 12,792,007.89\n- Total Quick Assets = (-1,980,427.60) + 385,137.69 + 18,176.52 + 12,792,007.89 ≈ 11,214,894.50\n- Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ 11.04\n\n*Note:* Negative cash is problematic, but assuming it's correct for this calculation.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities seem to be just the Current Liabilities since there's no long-term debt listed.\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n- Total Assets = 30,858,088.75\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,015,922.54 / 30,858,088.75 ≈ 0.03\n\n*Note:* If there's no other debt besides current liabilities, this is correct.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,842,166.21\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.03\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -18,924,462.44\n- Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ -18.63\n\n*Note:* Negative cash flow indicates the company is burning cash, which is not good for covering debt.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '20.00', 'Quick Ratio': '11.04', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-18.63'}}\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me double-check the components:\n\n- **Current Assets:** Correctly summed from the balance sheet.\n- **Current Liabilities:** Only taxes payable is listed under current liabilities.\n- **Quick Assets:** Excluded inventory, included receivables and cash equivalents.\n- **Total Debt:** Only current liabilities are present; no long-term debt.\n- **Operating Cash Flow:** Taken directly from the cash flow statement.\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly based on the provided data. The negative cash flow is a significant concern, but the ratios are calculated accurately given the numbers.",
