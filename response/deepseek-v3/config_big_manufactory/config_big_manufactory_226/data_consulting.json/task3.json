                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the given balance sheet data. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Asset Ratio\nFirst, I need to understand what the Debt to Asset Ratio is. From what I know, it's a financial metric that shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nBut sometimes, \"Total Debt\" can be interpreted as \"Total Liabilities.\" Looking at the balance sheet, we have \"Total Current Liabilities\" and sometimes long-term liabilities, but in this case, it seems all liabilities are current since there's no separate line for long-term liabilities.\n\n### Identifying the Components\nFrom the given balance sheet:\n\n1. **Total Assets**: This is straightforward. At the end of the reporting period (2024-02-05), it's given as 30,858,088.75.\n   \n2. **Total Debt**: This is a bit trickier. Since the balance sheet doesn't list long-term liabilities separately, and the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" which is 1,015,922.54. \n\n   - \"Accounts Payable\" is 0.00.\n   - \"Taxes Payable\" is 1,015,922.54.\n   - \"Total Current Liabilities\" sums these up to 1,015,922.54.\n\n   There's no mention of long-term debt or other liabilities, so it seems the total debt is just the total current liabilities here.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plugging the numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{1,015,922.54}{30,858,088.75} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,015,922.54}{30,858,088.75} \\approx 0.0329 \\]\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives approximately 0.03.\n\n### Verifying the Interpretation\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the \"Debt to Asset Ratio\" was calculated using \"Total Current Liabilities\" divided by \"Total Assets\":\n\n- Example's Total Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Example's Total Assets: 13,216,409.49\n- Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.1409, rounded to '0.14'\n\nThis matches the given solution, so my interpretation seems correct.\n\n### Checking for Other Liabilities\nIs there any other debt not listed under current liabilities? Looking at the balance sheet:\n\n- \"Paid-in Capital\" and \"Retained Earnings\" are part of owner's equity, not liabilities.\n- \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" equals \"Total Assets,\" which is correct, but it doesn't list separate long-term liabilities.\n\nThus, it seems the only liabilities are the current ones.\n\n### Final Calculation\nSo, for our problem:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\n- Total Assets: 30,858,088.75\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 1,015,922.54 / 30,858,088.75 ≈ 0.0329\n\nExpressed as a string with two decimal places: '0.03'\n\n### Potential Missteps\nInitially, I wondered if \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" could be used, but that's just the sum of liabilities and equity, equal to total assets. Also, I considered if \"Taxes Payable\" is the only liability, but \"Total Current Liabilities\" already sums up all current obligations, which is appropriate for the numerator in this ratio.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully analyzing the balance sheet and verifying with the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio is correctly calculated as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03'} }\n```",
