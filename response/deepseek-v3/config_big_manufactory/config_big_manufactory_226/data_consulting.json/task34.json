                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step, explaining how to calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -18,924,462.44\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculation:\n= -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ -18.63\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54 (since there's no long-term debt mentioned)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,842,166.21\n\nCalculation:\n= 1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.034\n\nWait a minute, in the example, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated using Total Current Liabilities as the debt, even though typically it's total liabilities (current + long-term). Here, since there's no long-term debt, it's just current liabilities. So, it's a very low ratio, indicating almost no debt compared to equity.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 20,318,450.67\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 28,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 30,858,088.75\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial + End) / 2 = (28,000,000 + 30,858,088.75) / 2 = 29,429,044.375\n\nCalculation:\n= 20,318,450.67 / 29,429,044.375 ≈ 0.69\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Assets = 20,314,894.50\n- Inventory = 9,100,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculation:\n= (20,314,894.50 - 9,100,000) / 1,015,922.54\n= 11,214,894.50 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ 11.04\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the first ratio we calculated:\n= -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ -18.63\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = 1,842,166.21\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Owner's Equity = 28,000,000.00\n- End Owner's Equity = 29,842,166.21\n- Average Equity = (28,000,000 + 29,842,166.21) / 2 = 28,921,083.105\n\nCalculation:\n= 1,842,166.21 / 28,921,083.105 ≈ 0.0637 or 6.37%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales):\n- Net Sales = 20,318,450.67\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 12,792,007.89\n- Average AR = (0 + 12,792,007.89) / 2 = 6,396,003.945\n\nCalculation:\n= 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.945 ≈ 3.18\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-18.63', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.69', 'Quick Ratio': '11.04', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-18.63', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '6.37%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.18'}}\n```\n\n**Reviewing the Calculations:**\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities: -18.924M / 1.015M ≈ -18.63 ✔\n- Debt to Equity: 1.015M / 29.842M ≈ 0.03 ✔ (very low debt)\n- Total Asset Turnover: 20.318M / 29.429M ≈ 0.69 ✔\n- Quick Ratio: (20.314M - 9.1M) / 1.015M ≈ 11.04 ✔ (very high, lots of liquid assets)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: Same as first ratio, -18.63 ✔\n- ROE: 1.842M / 28.921M ≈ 6.37% ✔\n- AR Turnover: 20.318M / 6.396M ≈ 3.18 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The company has a negative operating cash flow relative to its current liabilities, indicating potential liquidity issues despite a high quick ratio (due to high receivables and low current liabilities). The ROE is positive, showing profitability, and the asset turnover is moderate. The AR turnover suggests receivables are collected about 3 times a year, which might be slow depending on the industry.",
