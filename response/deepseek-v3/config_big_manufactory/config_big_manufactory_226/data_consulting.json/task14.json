Here, it is **20,318,450.67**.\n\n2. **Calculate Average Accounts Receivable**:\n   - **Beginning Accounts Receivable**: From the balance sheet's initial amount, it is **0.00** (since the initial amount is 0.00).\n   - **Ending Accounts Receivable**: From the balance sheet's end amount, it is **12,792,007.89**.\n   - **Average Accounts Receivable**: (Beginning + Ending) / 2 = (0.00 + 12,792,007.89) / 2 = **6,396,003.945**.\n\n3. **Compute the Ratio**:\n   - Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n   - Ratio = 20,318,450.67 / 6,396,003.945 â‰ˆ **3.18**.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.18'} }\n```",
