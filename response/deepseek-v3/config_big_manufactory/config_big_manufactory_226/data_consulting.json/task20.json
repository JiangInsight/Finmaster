                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods and services. The formula is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operations. It indicates the company's short-term liquidity. The formula is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$20,318,450.67\n- Cost of Goods Sold: \\$14,600,000.00\n- Gross Profit: \\$5,718,450.67\n\nFrom the **cash flow statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$18,924,462.44\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$1,015,922.54\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{5,718,450.67}{20,318,450.67} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5,718,450.67}{20,318,450.67} \\approx 0.2814\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.2814 \\times 100 \\approx 28.14\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **28.14%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-18,924,462.44}{1,015,922.54}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-18,924,462.44}{1,015,922.54} \\approx -18.63\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **-18.63**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: \\$5,718,450.67\n   - Total Revenue: \\$20,318,450.67\n   - \\$5,718,450.67 / \\$20,318,450.67 ≈ 0.2814 → 28.14%\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Net Operating Cash Flow: -\\$18,924,462.44\n   - Current Liabilities: \\$1,015,922.54\n   - -\\$18,924,462.44 / \\$1,015,922.54 ≈ -18.63\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Gross Profit Margin\": \"28.14%\", \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-18.63\"}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin (28.14%)**: This means that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about 28 cents after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a healthy margin, indicating good control over production costs relative to sales.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio (-18.63)**: A negative ratio is concerning. It suggests that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities. In fact, the negative value indicates that the company is using more cash in operations than it's generating, which could be a sign of financial stress, especially if this trend continues. \n\nThe large negative operating cash flow is primarily due to significant increases in accounts receivable and inventory, which are uses of cash, and the absence of any increase in accounts payable, which could have provided some cash inflow. This is something the company would need to address to improve its liquidity position.",
