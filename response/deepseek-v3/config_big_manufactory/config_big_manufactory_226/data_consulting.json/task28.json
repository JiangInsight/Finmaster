                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio, Gross Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nDebt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 1,015,922.54\n- There doesn't seem to be any long-term liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 30,858,088.75\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,015,922.54 / 30,858,088.75 ≈ 0.0329\n\nExpressed as a decimal, this is approximately 0.033, or 3.3% if converted to a percentage. However, since the example provided the ratio as a decimal without percentage, I'll keep it as '0.03' (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nWait, looking back at the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was given as '0.14', which seems to be a decimal. So, I'll present it similarly.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet shows:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\n- Total Owner's Equity: 29,842,166.21\n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity: 30,858,088.75\n\nSo, indeed, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54.\n\nThus, Debt to Asset Ratio = 1,015,922.54 / 30,858,088.75 ≈ 0.0329 ≈ '0.03'\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**  \nGross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 5,718,450.67\n- Total Revenue = 20,318,450.67\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (5,718,450.67 / 20,318,450.67) * 100 ≈ 28.14%\n\nSo, '28.14%'\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -18,924,462.44\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ -18.63\n\nSo, '-18.63'\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.14%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-18.63'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify the calculations:\n\n1. Debt to Asset Ratio: 1,015,922.54 / 30,858,088.75 ≈ 0.0329 → '0.03' (correct)\n2. Gross Profit Margin: (5,718,450.67 / 20,318,450.67) * 100 ≈ 28.14% (correct)\n3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ -18.63 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Gross Profit Margin': '28.14%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-18.63'}}\n```",
