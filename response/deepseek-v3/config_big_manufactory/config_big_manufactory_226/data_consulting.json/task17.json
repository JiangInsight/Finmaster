In this case, it is -18,924,462.44.\n\n2. **Identify the Total Debt**: The total debt is the sum of all liabilities. From the balance sheet, the only liability listed is \"Total Current Liabilities,\" which is 1,015,922.54. There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so the total debt is 1,015,922.54.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-18,924,462.44}{1,015,922.54} \\approx -18.63\n   \\]\n\n4. **Round the Result**: The result is rounded to two decimal places, giving -18.63.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-18.63'} }\n```",
