                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 1,015,922.54\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 29,842,166.21\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,015,922.54}{29,842,166.21} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,015,922.54}{29,842,166.21} \\approx 0.034 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.034.\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.16', which seems to be rounded to two decimal places. Maybe I should round similarly. \n\n0.034 rounded to two decimal places is 0.03.\n\nWait, is there any other liability I'm missing? The balance sheet shows only \"Total Current Liabilities\" under liabilities, and no other liabilities are listed. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example included some other liabilities not explicitly listed. But in our case, it's just the current liabilities.\n\nSo, I'll stick with 0.03.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculation:\n\n1,015,922.54 / 29,842,166.21 ≈ 0.034\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** 1,842,166.21\n- **Total Revenue:** 20,318,450.67\n\nNow, calculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,842,166.21}{20,318,450.67} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\n1,842,166.21 / 20,318,450.67 ≈ 0.0907\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n\n0.0907 * 100 ≈ 9.07%\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 9.07%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -18,924,462.44\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Current Liabilities:** 1,015,922.54\n\nNow, calculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-18,924,462.44}{1,015,922.54} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n-18,924,462.44 / 1,015,922.54 ≈ -18.63\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately -18.63.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.03\n- Net Profit Margin: 9.07%\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -18.63\n\nBut looking back at the example, the ratios were presented as strings with two decimal places for the first and last, and percentage with two decimals for the net profit margin. Let's format similarly:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: '0.03'\n- Net Profit Margin: '9.07%'\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: '-18.63'\n\nSo, the final JSON is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '9.07%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-18.63'}}\n```\n\nWait a minute, let me cross-validate the Debt to Equity Ratio. Maybe \"Total Liabilities\" includes more than just current liabilities, but in the balance sheet provided, only current liabilities are listed under liabilities. There's no long-term debt or other liabilities mentioned. So, it seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, the other calculations seem correct based on the provided data.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '9.07%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-18.63'}}\n```",
