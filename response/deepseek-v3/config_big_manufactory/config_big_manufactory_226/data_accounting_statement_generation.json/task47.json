Let's simplify:\n\nInitial cash: 5,000,000\nAdd: Bank to cash transfers: 7,000,000\nAdd: Sales in cash: 7,526,442.78\nTotal cash inflows: 19,526,442.78\n\nSubtract: Purchases in cash: 11,000,000\nSubtract: Expenses in cash: 2,682,000\nSubtract: Cash to bank transfers: 5,000,000\nTotal cash outflows: 18,682,000\n\nEnding cash balance: 19,526,442.78 - 18,682,000 = 844,442.78\n\nBut this seems too low. Perhaps the initial cash is only the cash deposit (5,000,000), and bank deposits are separate. \n\nFinal calculation:\nInitial cash: 5,000,000\nAdd: Bank to cash transfers: 7,000,000\nAdd: Sales in cash: 7,526,442.78\nTotal cash inflows: 19,526,442.78\n\nSubtract: Purchases in cash: 11,000,000\nSubtract: Expenses in cash: 2,682,000\nSubtract: Cash to bank transfers: 5,000,000\nTotal cash outflows: 18,682,000\n\nEnding cash balance: 19,526,442.78 - 18,682,000 = 844,442.78\n\nBut the bank balance is separate. The ending cash and cash equivalents would be the sum of ending cash and ending bank balance. \n\nInitial bank: 15,000,000\nAdd: Fixed asset purchases (bank transfers): -1,262,568.05 -1,408,259.42 = -2,670,827.47\nAdd: Purchases in bank transfers: -3,000,000 -2,000,000 -2,000,000 -1,000,000 = -8,000,000\nAdd: Bank to cash transfers: -7,000,000\nAdd: Cash to bank transfers: +5,000,000\nTotal bank outflows: -12,670,827.47\nEnding bank balance: 15,000,000 - 12,670,827.47 = 2,329,172.53\n\nTotal ending cash and cash equivalents: 844,442.78 (cash) + 2,329,172.53 (bank) = 3,173,615.31\n\nAfter rechecking, the correct ending balance is approximately 3,173,615.31.\n\nHowever, the example provided had a much smaller ending balance, so perhaps the initial cash and bank deposits are not both included in the cash and cash equivalents. \n\nAssuming only the initial cash deposit is considered (5,000,000), and bank deposits are not part of cash equivalents, then:\n\nInitial cash: 5,000,000\nAdd: Bank to cash transfers: 7,000,000\nAdd: Sales in cash: 7,526,442.78\nTotal inflows: 19,526,442.78\n\nSubtract: Purchases in cash: 11,000,000\nSubtract: Expenses in cash: 2,682,000\nSubtract: Cash to bank transfers: 5,000,000\nTotal outflows: 18,682,000\n\nEnding cash balance: 19,526,442.78 - 18,682,000 = 844,442.78\n\nThis seems more plausible. \n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Ending Balance\": \"844442.78\"}}\n```",
