                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the initial and final inventory values based on the transactions data provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Inventory Value\nThe initial inventory value is the sum of all purchases made on or before the start date (2023-12-31). From the data, we can see the following purchase transactions on 2023-12-31:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment D at 1,500,000.0\n2. Purchase20231231002: 2 units of Heavy Equipment D at 1,500,000.0 each (total 3,000,000.0)\n3. Purchase20231231003: 2 units of Heavy Equipment B at 800,000.0 each (total 1,600,000.0)\n4. Purchase20231231004: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment C at 1,000,000.0\n5. Purchase20231231005: 2 units of Heavy Equipment A at 500,000.0 each (total 1,000,000.0)\n6. Purchase20231231006: 2 units of Heavy Equipment C at 1,000,000.0 each (total 2,000,000.0)\n7. Purchase20231231007: 2 units of Heavy Equipment C at 1,000,000.0 each (total 2,000,000.0)\n8. Purchase20231231008: 2 units of Heavy Equipment B at 800,000.0 each (total 1,600,000.0)\n9. Purchase20231231009: 2 units of Heavy Equipment A at 500,000.0 each (total 1,000,000.0)\n10. Purchase20231231010: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment D at 1,500,000.0\n11. Purchase20231231011: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment A at 500,000.0\n12. Purchase20231231012: 2 units of Heavy Equipment A at 500,000.0 each (total 1,000,000.0)\n13. Purchase20231231013: 2 units of Heavy Equipment D at 1,500,000.0 each (total 3,000,000.0)\n14. Purchase20231231014: 2 units of Heavy Equipment D at 1,500,000.0 each (total 3,000,000.0)\n\nNow, sum all these purchases to get the initial inventory value:\n- 1,500,000.0 (Purchase20231231001)\n- 3,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231002)\n- 1,600,000.0 (Purchase20231231003)\n- 1,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231004)\n- 1,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231005)\n- 2,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231006)\n- 2,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231007)\n- 1,600,000.0 (Purchase20231231008)\n- 1,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231009)\n- 1,500,000.0 (Purchase20231231010)\n- 500,000.0 (Purchase20231231011)\n- 1,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231012)\n- 3,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231013)\n- 3,000,000.0 (Purchase20231231014)\n\nTotal Initial Inventory Value = 1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 22,700,000.0\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Inventory End Value\nThe inventory end value is the initial inventory value minus the cost of goods sold (COGS) from sales. From the data, the following sales transactions occurred:\n\n1. Sale20240105004: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment C at cost 1,000,000.0\n2. Sale20240107006: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment D at cost 1,500,000.0\n3. Sale20240111008: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment A at cost 500,000.0\n4. Sale20240114011: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment C at cost 1,000,000.0\n5. Sale20240117015: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment B at cost 800,000.0\n6. Sale20240118016: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment D at cost 1,500,000.0\n7. Sale20240119018: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment A at cost 500,000.0\n8. Sale20240121020: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment A at cost 500,000.0\n9. Sale20240125022: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment A at cost 500,000.0\n10. Sale20240128026: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment A at cost 500,000.0\n11. Sale20240130027: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment D at cost 1,500,000.0\n12. Sale20240131029: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment C at cost 1,000,000.0\n13. Sale20240201031: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment D at cost 1,500,000.0\n14. Sale20240203034: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment D at cost 1,500,000.0\n15. Sale20240204037: 1 unit of Heavy Equipment B at cost 800,000.0\n\nTotal COGS = 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 800,000 = 14,600,000.0\n\nInventory End Value = Initial Inventory Value - COGS\nInventory End Value = 22,700,000.0 - 14,600,000.0 = 8,100,000.0\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '22700000.00', 'Inventory End Value': '8100000.00'}}\n```",
