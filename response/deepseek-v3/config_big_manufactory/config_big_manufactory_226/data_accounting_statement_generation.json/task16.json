                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the paid-in capital item in the balance sheet, including both the initial and final amounts. Paid-in capital typically represents the amount of money that shareholders have invested in the company through the purchase of stock. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Transactions**: \n   - Look for transactions that represent initial capital injections. These are typically labeled as \"Cash deposit\" or \"Bank deposit\" in the \"type\" column.\n   - From the given data, the initial transactions are:\n     - Cash deposit: 5,000,000.0\n     - Bank deposit: 15,000,000.0\n     - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.0 (Note: Fixed assets are not part of paid-in capital, so we exclude this)\n\n2. **Calculate Initial Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Sum the initial cash and bank deposits:\n     - 5,000,000.0 (Cash) + 15,000,000.0 (Bank) = 20,000,000.0\n\n3. **Identify Final Transactions**:\n   - Paid-in capital typically does not change unless there are additional capital injections or withdrawals. From the given data, there are no transactions indicating additional capital injections or withdrawals after the initial deposits.\n   - Therefore, the final paid-in capital remains the same as the initial paid-in capital.\n\n4. **Final Paid-in Capital**:\n   - The final paid-in capital is the same as the initial paid-in capital: 20,000,000.0.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '20000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '20000000.00'}}\n```",
