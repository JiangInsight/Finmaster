This is because the cash flow statement reflects actual cash movements, and only taxes that have been paid (or received) will affect the cash position.\n\nLet's go through the transactions step by step:\n\n1. Identify all sales transactions where payment/receipt_status is \"Paid\".\n2. Sum the tax_amount from these transactions.\n\nFrom the given data, the relevant sales transactions with \"Paid\" status and their tax amounts are:\n\n- Sale20240105004: tax_amount = 73151.62\n- Sale20240107006: tax_amount = 107979.34\n- Sale20240117015: tax_amount = 57377.8\n- Sale20240121020: tax_amount = 33221.79\n- Sale20240130027: tax_amount = 104591.59\n\nNow, let's sum these tax amounts:\n\n73151.62 (Sale20240105004)\n+ 107979.34 (Sale20240107006)\n+ 57377.8 (Sale20240117015)\n+ 33221.79 (Sale20240121020)\n+ 104591.59 (Sale20240130027)\n= 376322.14\n\nTherefore, the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is 376322.14.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '376322.14'}}\n```",
