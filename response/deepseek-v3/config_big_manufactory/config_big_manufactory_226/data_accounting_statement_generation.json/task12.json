Accounts payable represents the amount a company owes to its suppliers for purchases made on credit. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Accounts Payable:**\n   - The initial accounts payable is the amount owed to suppliers at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31). \n   - From the transactions data, we look for purchases with \"payment/receipt_status\" as \"Unpaid\" and \"payment_method\" as \"Account Payable\" or similar credit terms.\n   - In the given data, there are no unpaid purchases at the initial date (2023-12-31). All purchases are marked as \"Paid\" or do not specify \"Account Payable\" as the payment method. \n   - Therefore, the initial accounts payable is **0.00**.\n\n2. **Identify Final Accounts Payable:**\n   - The final accounts payable is the amount owed to suppliers at the end of the period (after all transactions up to the end date).\n   - We look for purchases with \"payment/receipt_status\" as \"Unpaid\" and \"payment_method\" as \"Account Payable\" or similar credit terms.\n   - From the transactions data, there are no unpaid purchases at the end of the period. All purchases are marked as \"Paid\" or do not specify \"Account Payable\" as the payment method.\n   - Therefore, the final accounts payable is also **0.00**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '0.00'} }\n```",
