All purchase transactions in the given data have either \"Paid\" status or no payment status specified (which we can assume means they are paid unless marked otherwise).\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are no unpaid purchase transactions, the change in accounts payable is zero. This means there is no increase or decrease in accounts payable during the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '0.00'}}\n```",
