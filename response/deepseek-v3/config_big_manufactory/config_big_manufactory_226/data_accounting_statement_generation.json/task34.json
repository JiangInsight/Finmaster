Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Revenue from Sales**: Sum all sale transactions where profit is positive (since profit = revenue - cost)\n   - Sale20240105004: 463,032.36\n   - Sale20240107006: 659,586.87\n   - Sale20240111008: 249,601.75\n   - Sale20240114011: 332,686.65\n   - Sale20240117015: 347,555.96\n   - Sale20240118016: 656,466.82\n   - Sale20240119018: 168,808.14\n   - Sale20240121020: 164,435.83\n   - Sale20240125022: 174,830.39\n   - Sale20240128026: 207,188.94\n   - Sale20240130027: 591,831.76\n   - Sale20240131029: 417,458.33\n   - Sale20240201031: 499,604.61\n   - Sale20240203034: 528,402.09\n   - Sale20240204037: 256,960.17\n   Total Revenue: 5,818,921.69\n\n2. **Expenses**: Sum all expense transactions (administrative, sales, financial, depreciation)\n   - Administrative Expenses: Sum of all administrative expenses = 1,104,108.47\n   - Sales Expenses: Sum of all sales expenses = 1,013,377.61\n   - Financial Expenses: Sum of all financial expenses = 247,300.06\n   - Depreciation: 45,745.80 + 81,887.42 = 127,633.22\n   Total Expenses: 2,492,421.36\n\n3. **Interest Income**: Sum all interest receivables\n   Total Interest Income: 13,188.35\n\n4. **Net Profit Calculation**:\n   Net Profit = Total Revenue + Interest Income - Total Expenses\n   Net Profit = 5,818,921.69 + 13,188.35 - 2,492,421.36 = 3,339,688.68\n\nHowever, looking at the example provided, it seems we might need to consider only the profit figures from sales rather than calculating revenue separately. Let me recalculate using the profit figures directly from sales transactions:\n\n1. **Total Profit from Sales**:\n   Sum of all profit amounts from sales transactions = 5,818,921.69\n\n2. **Total Expenses**:\n   Same as above = 2,492,421.36\n\n3. **Interest Income**:\n   Same as above = 13,188.35\n\n4. **Net Profit**:\n   5,818,921.69 - 2,492,421.36 + 13,188.35 = 3,339,688.68\n\nBut this seems too large compared to the example. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the transactions again carefully.\n\nAfter re-examining, I notice that some purchase transactions might represent costs that should be deducted from profits. However, purchases are typically balance sheet items (inventory or fixed assets) rather than income statement expenses unless they are cost of goods sold. Since we don't have cost of goods sold information, we should stick to the profit figures from sales.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll present the calculation based on the profit figures from sales minus expenses plus interest income:\n\nFinal Net Profit = Total Profit from Sales - Total Expenses + Interest Income\n= 5,818,921.69 - 2,492,421.36 + 13,188.35\n= 3,339,688.68\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the example's negative net profit. Maybe there are other considerations I'm missing. Given the data provided, this is the most reasonable calculation I can make.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '3339688.68'} }\n```",
