                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we're interested in.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific pieces of information from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This would be the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" from the Balance Sheet or Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order to present these is: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided:\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Paid-in Capital | 28000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 28000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nHere, \"Paid-in Capital\" is the capital contributed by shareholders. The initial and end amounts are the same (28,000,000.00), which suggests no new capital was added during this period. However, the initial amount is what was contributed, so we'll take the initial amount as the capital contributed.\n\n**Value1: '28000000.00'**\n\n### 2. Income Statement\nNow, the Income Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Profit Before Tax | 2858088.75 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThis is the profit before tax expense is deducted, which is exactly what we're looking for.\n\n**Value2: '2858088.75'**\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nFor the increase in accounts payable, we can look at both the Balance Sheet and the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nIn the Balance Sheet:\n| Accounts Payable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\nThis shows no change; it stayed at 0.00.\n\nIn the Cash Flow Statement:\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\nAgain, no increase here.\n\nWait a minute, this seems odd. The problem mentions \"the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit,\" which is accounts payable. But in both the Balance Sheet and Cash Flow, Accounts Payable didn't increase; it's zero at both start and end.\n\nIs there another line that might represent this? Maybe \"Taxes Payable\" increased, but that's taxes, not goods/services.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example had \"Accounts Payable\" increasing, but in this case, it didn't. So the addition is zero.\n\n**Value3: '0.00'**\n\nBut let me double-check the example to ensure I'm interpreting correctly.\n\nLooking back at the example:\n- 'value3' was '1590000.00', which corresponds to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nIn our current problem, that line is 0.00, so 'value3' should be '0.00'.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together:\n\n- value1 (Paid-in Capital): '28000000.00'\n- value2 (Profit Before Tax): '2858088.75'\n- value3 (Increase in Accounts Payable): '0.00'\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '2858088.75', 'value3': '0.00'}}\n```\n\n### Verification\nLet me verify each:\n\n1. **Paid-in Capital**: Initial amount is 28,000,000.00, which is the capital contributed. Correct.\n2. **Profit Before Tax**: Clearly listed as 2,858,088.75. Correct.\n3. **Increase in Accounts Payable**: Both initial and end amounts are 0.00, so no increase. Correct.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '2858088.75', 'value3': '0.00'}}\n```",
