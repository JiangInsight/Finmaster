This is typically labeled as \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the section titled \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\". This section usually contains the beginning balance, ending balance, and net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n3. **Identify the Line Item**: Within the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, locate the line item labeled \"Beginning Balance\". This represents the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Beginning Balance\" is the amount we need to extract. In the given problem, this value is \"20000000.00\".\n\n5. **Verify the Date**: Ensure that the date associated with the \"Beginning Balance\" matches the period in question (2024-02-05 in this case). This confirms that the value is indeed for the correct period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20000000.00'}}\n```",
