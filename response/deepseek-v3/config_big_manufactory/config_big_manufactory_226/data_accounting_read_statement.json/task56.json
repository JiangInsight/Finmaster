This refers to the \"Depreciation\" expense in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Task**: The task asks for the value of depreciation, which is the systematic allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life. This is typically found in the income statement under expenses or in the cash flow statement under operating activities.\n\n2. **Locating Depreciation in the Financial Statements**:\n   - **Income Statement**: In the provided income statement, there is a line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with a value of \"127633.22\".\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: In the cash flow statement, under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\", there is also a line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with the same value of \"127633.22\".\n   - **Balance Sheet**: The balance sheet shows \"Accumulated Depreciation\" under non-current assets, which is the cumulative depreciation over time. The end amount is \"127633.22\", which matches the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n3. **Verification**: The depreciation value is consistent across the income statement and cash flow statement, confirming that \"127633.22\" is the correct value for the period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of depreciation for the period is \"127633.22\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '127633.22'}}\n```",
