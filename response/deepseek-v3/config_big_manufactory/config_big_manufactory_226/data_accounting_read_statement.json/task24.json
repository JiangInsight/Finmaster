In income statements, this is typically labeled as \"Administrative Expenses\" or something similar.\n\n2. **Review the Income Statement**: Looking at the provided income statement, we can see the following line items:\n   - Administrative Expenses\n   - Selling Expenses\n   - Depreciation\n   - Financial Expenses\n   - Total Expenses\n   - etc.\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: The line item that directly corresponds to the costs of general management and administration is \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Administrative Expenses\" is \"1127712.35.\"\n\n5. **Verify**: Ensure that this is the correct line item by confirming that it is not part of other expense categories like selling or financial expenses. \"Administrative Expenses\" is indeed the standalone category for general management and administration costs.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1127712.35'}}\n```",
