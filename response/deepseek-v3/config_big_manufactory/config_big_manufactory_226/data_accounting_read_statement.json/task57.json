This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: The amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is recorded under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet and cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Check the Balance Sheet**: \n   - In the balance sheet provided, the \"Accounts Payable\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00\n     - End_amount: 0.00\n   - This indicates that there was no change in the accounts payable during the period.\n\n3. **Verify the Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - In the cash flow statement, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" shows a value of 0.00. This confirms that there was no addition to the amount owed for goods or services on credit during the period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since both the balance sheet and cash flow statement show no change in accounts payable, the value of the addition is 0.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'}}\n```",
