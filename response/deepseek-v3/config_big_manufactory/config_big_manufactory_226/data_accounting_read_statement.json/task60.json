I'm going to approach it methodically to ensure I understand what's being asked and how to extract the correct information.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task is to identify and extract two specific line items from financial statements:\n\n1. **End value of funds deposited into a bank**: This likely refers to the \"Bank Deposits\" line item in the Balance Sheet, specifically the \"End_amount\" value.\n2. **Income earned by an entity from financial assets**: This probably refers to \"Interest Income\" from the Income Statement, as interest is typically earned from financial assets like bank deposits or investments.\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. However, since we're only extracting two values (Bank Deposits and Interest Income), and based on the example, it seems we're only concerned with these two from Balance Sheet and Income Statement respectively.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's look at the provided financial statements to find these two items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we're interested in \"Bank Deposits\":\n\n```\n| Bank Deposits | 15000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 385137.69 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nThe \"End_amount\" for Bank Deposits is `385137.69`. This is likely our first value (`value1`).\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNow, let's find \"Interest Income\" in the Income Statement:\n\n```\n| Interest Income | 18176.52 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nThe amount here is `18176.52`. This should be our second value (`value2`).\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nThe example didn't include anything from the Cash Flow Statement in the solution, and in this problem, we don't seem to need any values from here for the two specified items. So, we can ignore it for this task.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- `value1` was `'164645.57'`, which corresponds to \"Bank Deposits\" in the Balance Sheet.\n- `value2` was `'2672.87'`, which is \"Interest Income\" from the Income Statement.\n\nThis confirms our approach is correct.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nNow, compiling our findings:\n\n- `value1` (Bank Deposits - End_amount): `385137.69`\n- `value2` (Interest Income): `18176.52`\n\n### Potential Confusions\n\nInitially, one might wonder if \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet could be related to income from financial assets. However, \"Interest Receivable\" is an asset representing interest that's been earned but not yet received, whereas \"Interest Income\" is the actual income recognized. The task specifies \"income earned,\" which aligns with \"Interest Income.\"\n\nAlso, the order in the example was Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, which we've followed.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '385137.69', 'value2': '18176.52'}}\n```",
