                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand how to extract the required information from the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract the **net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities** from the cash flow statement. Operating activities are the principal revenue-producing activities of the entity, excluding investing and financing activities.\n\nFrom the example provided, the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is the main value we're interested in, and it's composed of several sub-items that contribute to this total. These sub-items are listed under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" in the statement.\n\n### Given Problem\n\nHere's the cash flow statement we're working with:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 1842166.21 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 127633.22 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -12792007.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -18176.52 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -9100000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 1015922.54 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -18924462.44 | 2024-02-05 |\n| ... (other sections not relevant to operating activities) ... |\n\n### Identifying the Main Value\n\nThe main value we're looking for is the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities,\" which is clearly listed as **-18,924,462.44**.\n\n### Identifying the Sub-items\n\nNow, let's list out the sub-items that contribute to this net cash flow from operating activities. These are all the line items under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" before the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" line. From the table, they are:\n\n1. Net Profit: 1,842,166.21\n2. Depreciation: 127,633.22\n3. (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: -12,792,007.89\n4. (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable: -18,176.52\n5. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -9,100,000.00\n6. Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 0.00\n7. Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable: 1,015,922.54\n\nThese are the seven sub-items that sum up to the net cash flow from operating activities.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nJust to ensure these are correct, let's add them up:\n\n1. 1,842,166.21 (Net Profit)\n2. + 127,633.22 (Depreciation) = 1,969,799.43\n3. - 12,792,007.89 (Increase in Accounts Receivable) = -10,822,208.46\n4. - 18,176.52 (Increase in Interest Receivable) = -10,840,384.98\n5. - 9,100,000.00 (Increase in Inventory) = -19,940,384.98\n6. + 0.00 (No change in Accounts Payable) = -19,940,384.98\n7. + 1,015,922.54 (Increase in Tax Payable) = -18,924,462.44\n\nThis matches the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" value, confirming our sub-items are correct.\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe solution should be in the following JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"______\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"______\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"______\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value3\": \"______\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value4\": \"______\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value5\": \"______\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value6\": \"______\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value7\": \"______\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFilling in the values:\n\n- \"value\": \"-18924462.44\"\n- \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"1842166.21\" (Net Profit)\n- \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"127633.22\" (Depreciation)\n- \"sub_items_sub_item value3\": \"-12792007.89\" (Accounts Receivable)\n- \"sub_items_sub_item value4\": \"-18176.52\" (Interest Receivable)\n- \"sub_items_sub_item value5\": \"-9100000.00\" (Inventory)\n- \"sub_items_sub_item value6\": \"0.00\" (Accounts Payable)\n- \"sub_items_sub_item value7\": \"1015922.54\" (Tax Payable)\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"-18924462.44\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"1842166.21\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"127633.22\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value3\": \"-12792007.89\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value4\": \"-18176.52\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value5\": \"-9100000.00\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value6\": \"0.00\",\n    \"sub_items_sub_item value7\": \"1015922.54\"\n  }\n}\n```",
