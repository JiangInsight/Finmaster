These assets are typically categorized under \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents assets held for sale or in production is \"Inventory\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Inventory\" is provided as \"0.00\" under the \"Initial_amount\" column with the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Inventory\" is provided as \"9100000.00\" under the \"End_amount\" column with the \"End_date\" of \"2024-02-05\".\n\n4. **Verify**:\n   - The initial and end values for \"Inventory\" are clearly stated in the balance sheet, and there are no other line items that fit the description of assets held for sale or in production.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '9100000.00'} }\n```",
