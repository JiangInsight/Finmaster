These are typically the current assets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all current assets.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial value of total current assets is given as \"20000000.00\" as of the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n   - **End Value**: The end value of total current assets is given as \"20314894.50\" as of the end date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Verify Non-Current Assets**: For completeness, we can note that non-current assets (like fixed assets) are not expected to be realized or consumed within the operating cycle, so they are not included in the solution.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The initial and end values of the total current assets are the values we need to report.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '20000000.00', 'end value': '20314894.50'} }\n```",
