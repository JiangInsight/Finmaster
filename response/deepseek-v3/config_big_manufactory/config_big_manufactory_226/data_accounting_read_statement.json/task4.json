This is because it records the interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Interest Receivable\" is given as '0.00' on the initial date '2023-12-31'.\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Interest Receivable\" is given as '18176.52' on the end date '2024-02-05'.\n\n3. **Construct the Solution**: Based on the above, the initial and end values for interest accrued but not yet received are '0.00' and '18176.52' respectively.\n\nHere is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '18176.52'} }\n```",
