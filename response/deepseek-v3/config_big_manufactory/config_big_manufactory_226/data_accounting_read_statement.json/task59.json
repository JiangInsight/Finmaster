I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the required information.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to extract two specific line items from the financial statements provided:\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically found as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet. It represents interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n   \n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is usually found in the cash flow statement under a line like \"Net Increase\" or similar, which shows the overall change in cash and cash equivalents over the period.\n\nThe financial statements are grouped in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we should maintain the original order of line items as presented.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's look at the provided financial statements to find these two items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, we're interested in \"Interest Receivable\":\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Interest Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 18176.52 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nHere, the \"End_amount\" for \"Interest Receivable\" is **18176.52**. This is the interest accrued but not yet received at the end of the period.\n\n#### 2. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, let's look at the cash flow statement for the net addition in cash and cash equivalents. We're looking for a line that indicates the net change in cash:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 20000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | -1595289.91 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -21595289.91 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nHere, \"Net Increase\" shows **-21595289.91**, which is the net addition (in this case, a decrease) in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n#### 3. Income Statement\n\nThe income statement is also provided, but we don't need any information from it for this task since both required items are found in the balance sheet and cash flow statement.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided to ensure we're on the right track:\n\n- **Example's value1 (Interest Receivable)**: 2672.87 (from Balance Sheet)\n- **Example's value2 (Net Increase in Cash)**: -7565348.53 (from Cash Flow Statement)\n\nThis matches our approach where:\n- value1 is from \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n- value2 is from \"Net Increase\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nFrom the problem to solve:\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received (value1)**: 18176.52 (from Interest Receivable in Balance Sheet)\n2. **Net addition in cash and cash equivalents (value2)**: -21595289.91 (from Net Increase in Cash Flow Statement)\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '18176.52', 'value2': '-21595289.91'}}\n```",
