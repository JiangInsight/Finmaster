In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit.\"\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFrom the given problem:\n- The \"Net Profit\" is listed as **1842166.21**.\n- The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is listed as **2670827.47**.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1842166.21', 'value2': '2670827.47'} }\n```",
