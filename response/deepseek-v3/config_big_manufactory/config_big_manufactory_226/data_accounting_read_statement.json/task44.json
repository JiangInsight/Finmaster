The value we are interested in is the \"Ending Balance\" of Cash and Cash Equivalents.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided problem, the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section is clearly marked. It includes:\n   - Beginning Balance\n   - Ending Balance\n   - Net Increase\n\n3. **Identify the Ending Balance**: The \"Ending Balance\" is the value of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period. In the given problem, this value is explicitly listed as \"-1595289.91\".\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value to be extracted is \"-1595289.91\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1595289.91'} }\n```",
