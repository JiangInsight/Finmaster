This typically corresponds to the \"Taxes Payable\" line item in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The balance sheet includes a line item labeled \"Taxes Payable\" under the \"Current Liabilities\" section. This represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is listed as \"0.00\" with the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is listed as \"1015922.54\" with the \"End_date\" of \"2024-02-05\".\n\n4. **Verify the Data**:\n   - The initial value is indeed \"0.00\", indicating no taxes were payable at the start of the period.\n   - The end value is \"1015922.54\", indicating the amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid by the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1015922.54'} }\n```",
