I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task is about analyzing a cash flow statement to extract specific information related to cash flows from investing activities. Here's what we need to do:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents from Investing Activities**: This is the total cash generated or used in investing activities.\n2. **Decompose this Item into Sub-items**: We need to find the components that make up this net amount, all of which should come from the cash flow statement provided.\n3. **Output the Values**: For the main item and its sub-items, we need to provide their final values.\n\n### Given Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 1842166.21 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 127633.22 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -12792007.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -18176.52 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -9100000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 1015922.54 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -18924462.44 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Cash Flow from Investing Activities** |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Purchase of Fixed Assets**  | 2670827.47 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**  | -2670827.47 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 20000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | -1595289.91 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -21595289.91 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Identifying the Main Item\n\nFrom the statement, the section related to investing activities is:\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: -2670827.47\n\nThis is the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from investing activities. \n\n### Decomposing into Sub-items\n\nNow, we need to find the sub-items that make up this net amount. Looking at the investing activities section:\n\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 2670827.47\n\nThis is the only sub-item listed under investing activities in this statement. \n\nThe net cash flow from investing activities is calculated as the sum of all investing activities. Here, it's just the purchase of fixed assets, which is an outflow (hence the negative sign in the net cash flow).\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nLet's verify how the net cash flow from investing activities is derived:\n\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: +2670827.47 (but since it's a purchase, it's a cash outflow, so it's -2670827.47)\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -2670827.47\n\nThis checks out because there's only one component here.\n\n### Final Values\n\n- **Main Item (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities)**: -2670827.47\n- **Sub-item (Purchase of Fixed Assets)**: 2670827.47\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe solution should be in the following JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '______'} }\n```\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems the 'sub_items' is a dictionary with the key being the description and the value being the amount. Here, since we have only one sub-item, which is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\", but in the example, it's just labeled as 'sub_item value'. \n\nGiven that, and to match the example's format where the sub-item is just a value without a label, we'll present it similarly.\n\nSo, the sub_item value is the amount of the purchase: 2670827.47.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2670827.47', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '2670827.47'}}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the relevant section**: Looked at the cash flow statement and found the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n2. **Found the net amount**: \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is -2670827.47.\n3. **Identified sub-items**: Only one sub-item under investing activities: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with amount 2670827.47.\n4. **Verified the calculation**: The net is the negative of the purchase amount, indicating an outflow.\n5. **Formatted the answer**: Matched the structure to the given example.\n\nThus, the solution is correctly derived and formatted.",
