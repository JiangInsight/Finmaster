This is typically listed as \"Paid-in Capital\" or a similar term in the balance sheet under the Owner's Equity section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Paid-in Capital\" is present under the Owner's Equity section. This represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial amount for \"Paid-in Capital\" is listed as `28000000.00` with the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end amount for \"Paid-in Capital\" is listed as `28000000.00` with the end date `2024-02-05`.\n\n4. **Verify Consistency**:\n   - The initial and end values for \"Paid-in Capital\" are the same, indicating no additional capital was contributed during the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '28000000.00', 'end value': '28000000.00'} }\n```",
