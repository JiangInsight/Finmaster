These liabilities are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the entity's normal operating cycle, usually within one year. In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are:\n     - Accounts Payable\n     - Taxes Payable\n     - Total Current Liabilities\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" and \"Initial_date\" columns provide the starting values and dates for each line item.\n   - The \"End_amount\" and \"End_date\" columns provide the ending values and dates for each line item.\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" line item summarizes all current liabilities, which is the value we are interested in.\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Data**:\n   - From the balance sheet provided:\n     - \"Total Current Liabilities\" has an \"Initial_amount\" of \"0.00\" as of \"2023-12-31\".\n     - \"Total Current Liabilities\" has an \"End_amount\" of \"1015922.54\" as of \"2024-02-05\".\n\n4. **Verify Line Items**:\n   - The individual line items under current liabilities (\"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\") are also listed, but their values are already included in the \"Total Current Liabilities\".\n   - \"Accounts Payable\" has an \"End_amount\" of \"0.00\", and \"Taxes Payable\" has an \"End_amount\" of \"1015922.54\". The sum of these (0.00 + 1015922.54) matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" of \"1015922.54\".\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value of total current liabilities is \"0.00\".\n   - The end value of total current liabilities is \"1015922.54\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1015922.54'}}\n```",
