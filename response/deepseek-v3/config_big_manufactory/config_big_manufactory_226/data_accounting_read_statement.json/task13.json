These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually one year). In the given balance sheet, the non-current assets are represented by \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" and their total is given under \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is provided under \"Total Non-current Assets\" for the initial date (2023-12-31), which is `8000000.00`.\n   - The end value of non-current assets is provided under \"Total Non-current Assets\" for the end date (2024-02-05), which is `10543194.25`.\n\n3. **Verify the Line Items**:\n   - The line items contributing to the total non-current assets are \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation.\" The net value is calculated as:\n     - Initial: Fixed Assets (`8000000.00`) - Accumulated Depreciation (`0.00`) = `8000000.00`.\n     - End: Fixed Assets (`10670827.47`) - Accumulated Depreciation (`127633.22`) = `10543194.25`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The initial and end values of total non-current assets are correctly represented by the \"Total Non-current Assets\" line in the balance sheet.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10543194.25'} }\n```",
