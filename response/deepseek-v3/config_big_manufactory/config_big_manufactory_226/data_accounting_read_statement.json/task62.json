                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. I'm going to identify and extract three specific line items from the given financial statements:\n\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit** (This is typically \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet).\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation** (This is usually \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement).\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets** (This is often \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement).\n\nLet's go through each financial statement one by one in the specified order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we're interested in \"Accounts Receivable\" because it represents money owed to the company for goods or services sold on credit.\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n```\nAccounts Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 12792007.89 | 2024-02-05\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" for Accounts Receivable is **12,792,007.89**. This is our first value (`value1`).\n\n### 2. Income Statement\nNext, from the Income Statement, we need \"Financial Expenses\" which represent the financing costs.\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n```\nFinancial Expenses | 297417.97 | 2024-02-05\n```\nThe amount for Financial Expenses is **297,417.97**. This is our second value (`value2`).\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nFinally, from the Cash Flow Statement, we're looking for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" which shows cash spent on long-term assets.\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\nPurchase of Fixed Assets | 2670827.47 | 2024-02-05\n```\nThe amount for Purchase of Fixed Assets is **2,670,827.47**. This is our third value (`value3`).\n\n### Verifying the Order\nJust to ensure we're following the correct order:\n1. Balance Sheet: Accounts Receivable → `value1`\n2. Income Statement: Financial Expenses → `value2`\n3. Cash Flow Statement: Purchase of Fixed Assets → `value3`\n\nAll values are correctly identified in the specified order.\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '12792007.89', 'value2': '297417.97', 'value3': '2670827.47'} }\n```",
