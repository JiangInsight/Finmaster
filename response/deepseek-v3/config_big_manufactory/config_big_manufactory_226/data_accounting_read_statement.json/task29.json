The goal is to:\n\n1. **Identify and extract the specific line item and value of total income arising from the entity’s ordinary activities.** This typically refers to the total revenue or income generated from the main operations of the business.\n   \n2. **Decompose this total income into 1 component sub-item.** This means breaking down the total income into one of its constituent parts, which should also be listed in the income statement provided.\n\n3. **For the sub-item, output its initial and final values.** Since the example shows only one value for the sub-item, it seems we're expected to provide the same value for both initial and final (unless there's a change over time, but the data is for a single date).\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Example\n\nLooking at the example:\n\n- The total income from ordinary activities is \"Total Revenue\" with a value of \"5431018.59\".\n- This is decomposed into one sub-item: \"Main Business Revenue\" with the same value \"5431018.59\".\n- The solution format is:\n  ```json\n  {\"solution\": {'value': '5431018.59', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '5431018.59'}}}\n  ```\n\nThis suggests that \"Total Revenue\" is the total income, and \"Main Business Revenue\" is its sole component in this case.\n\n### Applying to the Problem to Solve\n\nNow, let's look at the problem statement:\n\nThe income statement includes:\n\n- \"Main Business Revenue\": 20318450.67\n- \"Total Revenue\": 20318450.67\n- Other items like costs, expenses, profits, etc.\n\nFollowing the example:\n\n1. **Total income from ordinary activities**: This is \"Total Revenue\" with the value \"20318450.67\".\n2. **Decompose into 1 sub-item**: The obvious component is \"Main Business Revenue\", which is the primary source of revenue.\n   - Its value is \"20318450.67\".\n3. **Initial and final values for sub-item**: Since there's only one date, initial and final are the same.\n\n### Verifying\n\nIs \"Main Business Revenue\" the only component of \"Total Revenue\"? In the given data, yes—there are no other revenue line items like \"Other Revenue\" or \"Interest Income\" is listed separately under expenses/income. So, \"Total Revenue\" equals \"Main Business Revenue\".\n\n### Constructing the Solution\n\nFollowing the format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20318450.67', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '20318450.67'}}}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20318450.67', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '20318450.67'}}}\n```",
