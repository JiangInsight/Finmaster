                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're asked to extract. \n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's recap what we're looking for:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This usually refers to changes in \"Inventory\".\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is generally the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNow, let's find these in the provided statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Cash Flow Statement\n\nHere's the cash flow statement we're working with:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 1842166.21 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 127633.22 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -12792007.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -18176.52 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -9100000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 1015922.54 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -18924462.44 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 2670827.47 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -2670827.47 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 20000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | -1595289.91 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -21595289.91 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Extracting the Required Values\n\n1. **Depreciation**: \n   - This is straightforward. We see \"Depreciation\" with an amount of \"127633.22\".\n   - So, `value1 = '127633.22'`.\n\n2. **Change in Inventory**:\n   - The line item is \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\". \n   - The amount is \"-9100000.00\". A negative value here indicates an increase in inventory (since it's a cash outflow).\n   - So, `value2 = '-9100000.00'`.\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - This is directly listed as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n   - The amount is \"-2670827.47\".\n   - So, `value3 = '-2670827.47'`.\n\n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - This is the \"Net Increase\" at the bottom of the statement.\n   - The amount is \"-21595289.91\".\n   - So, `value4 = '-21595289.91'`.\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe task mentions that for multiple outputs, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the statement:\n\n1. Depreciation appears early in the operating activities.\n2. Inventory change is listed after that.\n3. Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities is in the investing section.\n4. Net Increase is at the very end.\n\nSo, the order we've taken seems correct based on the sequence in the statement.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '127633.22', 'value2': '-9100000.00', 'value3': '-2670827.47', 'value4': '-21595289.91'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Depreciation**: Found under operating activities as \"Depreciation\" → 127633.22.\n2. **Inventory Change**: \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" → -9100000.00.\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: Directly listed → -2670827.47.\n4. **Net Increase in Cash**: \"Net Increase\" at the end → -21595289.91.\n\nAll values are correctly identified and ordered as per the statement's sequence.",
