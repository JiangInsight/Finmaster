This is typically found under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section of the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section contains the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is the standard label for cash payments to acquire PP&E and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `2670827.47`. This represents the cash outflow for acquiring PP&E and other long-term assets during the period.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is `-2670827.47`, which matches the value of \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" (since it's the only item listed under investing activities in this example). This confirms that the entire cash outflow for investing activities is attributed to the purchase of fixed assets.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2670827.47'}}\n```",
