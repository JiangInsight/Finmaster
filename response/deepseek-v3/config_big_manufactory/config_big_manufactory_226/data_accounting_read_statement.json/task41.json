This is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we can see the following line items under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\":\n   - Net Profit\n   - Depreciation\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n   - **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" has a value of \"1015922.54\". This represents the increase in tax accrued but not yet paid.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The term \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" indicates that this is the amount by which the tax payable has increased (or decreased) during the period. A positive value here means that the tax payable has increased, i.e., more tax has been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1015922.54'} }\n```",
