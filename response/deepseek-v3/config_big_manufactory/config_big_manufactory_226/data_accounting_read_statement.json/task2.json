The line item we are interested in is \"Bank Deposits,\" which should include both the initial and final values.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for the \"Bank Deposits\" row in the balance sheet. This is the line item that represents the funds deposited into a bank.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value is found under the \"Initial_amount\" column for the \"Bank Deposits\" row.\n   - In the given problem, the initial value is \"15000000.00\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value is found under the \"End_amount\" column for the \"Bank Deposits\" row.\n   - In the given problem, the end value is \"385137.69\".\n\n4. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - The solution should be presented in the specified JSON format with the initial and end values for \"Bank Deposits\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '15000000.00', 'end value': '385137.69'} }\n```",
