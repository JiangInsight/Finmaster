This is the amount of tax the entity is expected to pay for the reporting period.\n\n3. **Locate the Tax Expense in the Given Problem**: \n   - The line item \"Profit Before Tax\" is followed by \"Tax Expense\".\n   - The value associated with \"Tax Expense\" is \"1015922.54\".\n\n4. **Extract the Tax Expense Value**: The value \"1015922.54\" is the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1015922.54'} }\n```",
