This information is typically found under \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Retained Earnings\" represents the profit or loss retained in the entity. This is the amount not distributed to shareholders.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Retained Earnings\" is provided in the \"Initial_amount\" column. In this case, it is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Retained Earnings\" is provided in the \"End_amount\" column. In this case, it is `1842166.21` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n4. **Verify the Data**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00`, which means there were no retained earnings at the start of the period.\n   - The end value is `1842166.21`, indicating a positive retained earnings (profit) at the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1842166.21'} }\n```",
