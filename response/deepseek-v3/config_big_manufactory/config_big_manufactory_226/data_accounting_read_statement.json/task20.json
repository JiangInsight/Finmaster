COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n   \n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is present with an amount of \"14600000.00\" for the date \"2024-02-05.\"\n\n3. **Verify the Line Item**: There are no other line items that could represent the carrying amount of inventories sold (e.g., \"Inventory Sold\" or \"Cost of Sales\"). The \"Total Cost\" line item also matches the \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" confirming that this is the correct value.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"14600000.00.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '14600000.00'} }\n```",
