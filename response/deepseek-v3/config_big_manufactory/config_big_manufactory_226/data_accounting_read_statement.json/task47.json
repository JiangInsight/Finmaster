I'm going to break it down to understand how to find the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, and then identify its two component sub-items from the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's recall what a cash flow statement typically shows. It provides information about the cash inflows and outflows of a company during a specific period, categorized into three main activities:\n\n1. **Operating Activities**: Cash generated or used in the core business operations.\n2. **Investing Activities**: Cash used for or generated from investments like purchasing or selling assets.\n3. **Financing Activities**: Cash from or used in financing activities like issuing stock or paying dividends.\n\nHowever, in the given problem, we don't see a \"Financing Activities\" section, but we do have a section labeled \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" which seems to summarize the changes in cash over the period.\n\n### Identifying the Net Addition in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe \"Net Increase\" in the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section represents the overall change in cash during the period. This is essentially the net addition (or reduction) in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFrom the given data:\n- **Net Increase**: -21,595,289.91\n\nThis means there was a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents by this amount during the period.\n\n### Decomposing the Net Increase into Two Sub-items\n\nThe net increase in cash is typically calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Net Increase} = \\text{Ending Balance} - \\text{Beginning Balance} \\]\n\nSo, the two sub-items that make up the net increase are:\n1. **Beginning Balance**: The cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n2. **Ending Balance**: The cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period.\n\nFrom the data:\n- **Beginning Balance**: 20,000,000.00\n- **Ending Balance**: -1,595,289.91\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n\\[ \\text{Net Increase} = \\text{Ending Balance} - \\text{Beginning Balance} \\]\n\\[ -21,595,289.91 = -1,595,289.91 - 20,000,000.00 \\]\n\\[ -1,595,289.91 - 20,000,000.00 = -21,595,289.91 \\]\nThis checks out.\n\n### Verifying Against the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example to ensure our approach aligns:\n- **Net Increase**: -7,565,348.53\n- **Beginning Balance**: 8,000,000.00\n- **Ending Balance**: 434,651.47\nCalculation:\n\\[ 434,651.47 - 8,000,000.00 = -7,565,348.53 \\]\nWhich matches the net increase.\n\nThis confirms that our method is correct.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nNow, compiling the information for the given problem:\n\n- **value (Net Increase)**: -21,595,289.91\n- **sub_item value1 (Beginning Balance)**: 20,000,000.00\n- **sub_item value2 (Ending Balance)**: -1,595,289.91\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-21595289.91\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value1\": \"20000000.00\", \"sub_item value2\": \"-1595289.91\"}}}\n```",
