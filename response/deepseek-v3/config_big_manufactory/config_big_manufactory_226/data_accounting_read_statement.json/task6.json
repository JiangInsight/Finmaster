These items are typically categorized under \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The relevant line item in the balance sheet that represents tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\". This is because fixed assets include property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) which are used in these activities.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, the \"Fixed Assets\" line item shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 8000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 10670827.47 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item is also provided, but it is not part of the initial or end value of the fixed assets. It is a contra account that reduces the gross value of fixed assets to reflect their net book value. However, the task asks for the value of the tangible items themselves, not their net book value after depreciation. Therefore, we use the \"Fixed Assets\" values directly.\n\n4. **Final Values**:\n   - Initial value: 8000000.00\n   - End value: 10670827.47\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10670827.47'} }\n```",
