I'm going to break it down to understand what each part is asking for and then extract the relevant information from the given income statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract three specific line items from the income statement along with their values:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This typically refers to the total revenue generated from the main operations of the business. In income statements, this is often labeled as \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold during the period. In accounting terms, this is known as the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the expenses related to the general administration and management of the company, not tied directly to production or sales. This is usually labeled as \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided income statement and identify these three items.\n\nHere's the income statement presented in a more readable format:\n\n| Account                  | Amount       | Date       |\n|--------------------------|--------------|------------|\n| Main Business Revenue    | 20318450.67  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue            | 20318450.67  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold       | 14600000.00  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost               | 14600000.00  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit             | 5718450.67   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses  | 1127712.35   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Selling Expenses         | 1325774.90   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation             | 127633.22    | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses       | 297417.97    | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses           | 2878538.44   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income          | 18176.52     | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax        | 2858088.75   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense              | 1015922.54   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit               | 1842166.21   | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Identifying the Three Required Items\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**:\n   - This is the revenue from the main operations. We have both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" listed, both with the same amount. Typically, \"Total Revenue\" is the comprehensive term that includes all revenue streams, but since they're the same here, either would suffice. Following the example, it seems \"Total Revenue\" is used.\n   - **Value**: 20318450.67\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period (Cost of Goods Sold)**:\n   - This is clearly labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n   - **Value**: 14600000.00\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**:\n   - This is labeled as \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n   - **Value**: 1127712.35\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- 'value1' was \"5431018.59\" which corresponds to \"Total Revenue.\"\n- 'value2' was \"4410000.00\" which is \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n- 'value3' was \"1425164.20\" which is \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\nThis matches our understanding, confirming that we're extracting the correct line items.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above analysis, the three required values are:\n\n1. Total Revenue: 20318450.67\n2. Cost of Goods Sold: 14600000.00\n3. Administrative Expenses: 1127712.35\n\nHere's the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '20318450.67', 'value2': '14600000.00', 'value3': '1127712.35'}}\n```",
