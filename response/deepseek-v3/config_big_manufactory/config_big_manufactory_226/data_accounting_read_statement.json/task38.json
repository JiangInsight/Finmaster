                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify the specific line item in the cash flow statement that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" line item, as it shows changes in the amounts owed by customers (i.e., accounts receivable).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task asks for the value of the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit. This is directly related to the \"Accounts Receivable\" line in the cash flow statement.\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present with an amount of \"-12792007.89\".\n   - A negative value here indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., more amounts are owed to the entity), while a positive value would indicate a decrease (i.e., less amounts are owed to the entity).\n   - However, the task specifies \"decrease in amounts owed,\" which would correspond to a positive value. Since the value is negative, it actually represents an increase, not a decrease. But the task might be phrased to capture the absolute line item regardless of the direction.\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is \"-12792007.89\". Even though it's negative, this is the line item that answers the question as phrased.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is \"-12792007.89\". \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-12792007.89'}}\n```",
