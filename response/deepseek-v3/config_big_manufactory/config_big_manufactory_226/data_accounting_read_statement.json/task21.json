In an income statement, this is usually represented by the revenue from the main business operations.\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Main Business Revenue\" clearly represents the income from core operating activities. This is distinct from other income sources like \"Interest Income,\" which is not part of core operations.\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Main Business Revenue\" is \"20318450.67\".\n\n### Solution:\nThe value of income arising from the entity's core operating activities is \"20318450.67\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20318450.67'}}\n```",
