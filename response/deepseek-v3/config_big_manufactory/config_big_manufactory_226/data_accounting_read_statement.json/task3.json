This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Receivable\" represents amounts owed to the entity by customers for goods or services sold on credit. This is the item we are interested in.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, locate the \"Accounts Receivable\" row.\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" column shows the value at the start of the period (initial value).\n   - The \"End_amount\" column shows the value at the end of the period (end value).\n\n3. **Values from the Given Problem**:\n   - Initial_amount for \"Accounts Receivable\": `0.00` (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End_amount for \"Accounts Receivable\": `12792007.89` (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '12792007.89'} }\n```",
