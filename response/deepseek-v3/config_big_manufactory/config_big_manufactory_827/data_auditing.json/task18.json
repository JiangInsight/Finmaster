First, I'll look for transactions with the same ID that might have conflicting information. In this dataset, I notice transaction \"Sale20240117017\" has some issues.\n\n2. Looking at the invoice description for Sale20240117017:\n   - It states \"consisting of 1.0 units at a unit price of $703009.17, totaling $703009.17\"\n   - But the recorded_amount is 0.0 (which contradicts the invoice)\n   - Recorded_quantity is 0 (should be 1 per invoice)\n   - Recorded_profit is 257384.48 but should be 203009.17 (703009.17 - 500000 cost)\n   - Recorded payment status is \"Paid\" but invoice says \"unpaid\"\n\n3. The risk_issues field also confirms these discrepancies:\n   - Original quantity: 1.0 vs Recorded: 0\n   - Original payment status: Unpaid vs Recorded: Paid\n   - Original profit: 203009.17 vs Recorded: 257384.48\n\n4. Based on the invoice (which is considered reliable), the correct values should be:\n   - Quantity: 1.0\n   - Amount: 703009.17\n   - Payment status: Unpaid\n   - Profit: 203009.17\n\nHere's the solution in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\", \n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\", \n    \"Original date\": \"2024-01-17\", \n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-17\", \n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Unpaid\", \n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\", \n    \"Original payment_method\": null, \n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null, \n    \"Original quantity\": \"1.0\", \n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"0.0\", \n    \"Original price\": \"703009.17\", \n    \"Recorded price\": \"703009.17\", \n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\", \n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\", \n    \"Original amount\": \"703009.17\", \n    \"Recorded amount\": \"0.0\", \n    \"Original tax\": \"35150.46\", \n    \"Recorded tax\": \"35150.46\", \n    \"Original profit\": \"203009.17\", \n    \"Recorded profit\": \"257384.48\", \n    \"Original Preparer\": null, \n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null, \n    \"Original Approver\": null, \n    \"Recorded Approver\": null, \n    \"id\": \"Sale20240117017\"\n}}\n```",
