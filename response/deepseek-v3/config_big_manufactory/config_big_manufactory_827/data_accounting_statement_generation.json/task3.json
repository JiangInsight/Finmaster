                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the inventory item in the balance sheet, including both the initial and final amounts. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Inventory Value\nThe initial inventory value is the sum of all purchases made on or before the start date (2023-12-31) that are not yet sold. From the given data, all purchases are made on 2023-12-31, so the initial inventory value is the sum of all these purchases.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Initial Inventory Value\nFrom the data, the purchases made on 2023-12-31 are:\n1. Purchase20231231001: 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n2. Purchase20231231002: 2,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C, 2 units)\n3. Purchase20231231003: 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n4. Purchase20231231004: 1,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A, 2 units)\n5. Purchase20231231005: 3,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D, 2 units)\n6. Purchase20231231006: 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n7. Purchase20231231007: 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n8. Purchase20231231008: 3,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D, 2 units)\n9. Purchase20231231009: 1,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A, 2 units)\n10. Purchase20231231010: 2,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C, 2 units)\n11. Purchase20231231011: 1,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A, 2 units)\n12. Purchase20231231012: 3,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D, 2 units)\n\nSumming these up:\n800,000 + 2,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 18,200,000.0\n\nHowever, the initial inventory value is typically zero unless there are prior unsold inventories. Since all purchases are made on the start date, the initial inventory value is zero.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Final Inventory Value\nThe final inventory value is the sum of all purchases minus the cost of goods sold (COGS). From the data, the sales and their corresponding COGS are:\n1. Sale20240103001: COGS = 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n2. Sale20240106004: COGS = 500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit)\n3. Sale20240107005: COGS = 1,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit)\n4. Sale20240108008: COGS = 800,000.0 (Heavy Equipment B, 1 unit)\n5. Sale20240109009: COGS = 1,500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D, 1 unit)\n6. Sale20240111011: COGS = 1,500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D, 1 unit)\n7. Sale20240117017: COGS = 500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit)\n8. Sale20240122024: COGS = 500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit)\n9. Sale20240124028: COGS = 500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment A, 1 unit)\n10. Sale20240125030: COGS = 1,000,000.0 (Heavy Equipment C, 1 unit)\n11. Sale20240129034: COGS = 1,500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D, 1 unit)\n12. Sale20240131038: COGS = 1,500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D, 1 unit)\n13. Sale20240205042: COGS = 1,500,000.0 (Heavy Equipment D, 1 unit)\n\nTotal COGS = 800,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 = 12,600,000.0\n\nFinal Inventory Value = Total Purchases - Total COGS = 18,200,000 - 12,600,000 = 5,600,000.0\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Inventory Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Inventory End Value\": \"5600000.00\"}}\n```",
