The \"Fixed Assets\" entry is not part of cash and cash equivalents, so we don't include it in this calculation.\n\nAdding these together:\n5,000,000.00 (Cash) + 15,000,000.00 (Bank) = 20,000,000.00\n\nTherefore, the beginning balance is 20,000,000.00.\n\nThe solution is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '20000000.00'} }\n```",
