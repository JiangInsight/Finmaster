                        "content": "To calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for the income statement, we need to sum up all the cost amounts associated with sales transactions. The cost amount is the cost of the goods that were sold, which is typically recorded in the \"cost_amount\" field in the sales transactions.\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. Identify all transactions where the \"type\" is \"Sale\".\n2. For each sale transaction, extract the \"cost_amount\" field.\n3. Sum all these cost amounts to get the total COGS.\n\nLooking at the provided data, the sale transactions and their corresponding cost amounts are:\n\n1. Sale20240103001: cost_amount = 800000.0\n2. Sale20240106004: cost_amount = 500000.0\n3. Sale20240107005: cost_amount = 1000000.0\n4. Sale20240108008: cost_amount = 800000.0\n5. Sale20240109009: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n6. Sale20240111011: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n7. Sale20240117017: cost_amount = 500000.0\n8. Sale20240122024: cost_amount = 500000.0\n9. Sale20240124028: cost_amount = 500000.0\n10. Sale20240125030: cost_amount = 1000000.0\n11. Sale20240129034: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n12. Sale20240131038: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n13. Sale20240205042: cost_amount = 1500000.0\n\nNow, let's sum these amounts:\n\n800,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 800,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 500,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,500,000 = 11,600,000\n\nTherefore, the Cost of Goods Sold is 11,600,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '11600000.00'} }\n```",
