                        "content": "To calculate the final net cash flows from investing activities in the cash flow statement, we need to identify all transactions related to investing activities. Typically, investing activities include:\n\n1. Purchases of fixed assets (e.g., property, plant, and equipment)\n2. Proceeds from the sale of fixed assets\n3. Purchases of investments\n4. Proceeds from the sale of investments\n5. Loans made to others (if any)\n6. Collections on loans (if any)\n\nFrom the given data, the relevant transactions are:\n\n1. **Fixed Assets Purchase**: These are cash outflows for investing activities.\n   - `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 871751.87 | 871751.87 | ...`\n   - `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 1046775.17 | 1046775.17 | ...`\n   - `FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 577494.56 | 577494.56 | ...`\n\n2. **Purchases of Heavy Equipment**: These are also cash outflows for investing activities if they are capital expenditures (fixed assets). However, in the given data, these are recorded under \"Purchase\" type, which might be operational purchases. We need to confirm if these are capital expenditures. Given the context, it seems these are operational purchases (inventory), so they should not be included in investing activities.\n\n3. **Sales of Heavy Equipment**: These are cash inflows for investing activities if they involve the sale of fixed assets. However, in the given data, these are recorded under \"Sale\" type, which might be operational sales. Given the context, it seems these are operational sales (inventory), so they should not be included in investing activities.\n\nThus, the only clear investing activities are the fixed assets purchases. \n\n### Calculation:\n- Total cash outflows for fixed assets purchases:\n  - 871,751.87 (Heavy Machinery4)\n  - 1,046,775.17 (Industrial Facilities5)\n  - 577,494.56 (Production Line Equipment6)\n  - Total = 871,751.87 + 1,046,775.17 + 577,494.56 = 2,496,021.60\n\nThere are no cash inflows from investing activities in the given data. \n\n### Final Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities:\nNet Cash Flow = Total Cash Outflows = -2,496,021.60\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-2496021.60'}}\n```",
