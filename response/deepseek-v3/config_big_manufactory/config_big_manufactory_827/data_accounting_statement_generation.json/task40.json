Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all purchase transactions (inventory additions)\nFrom the data, we can see the following purchase transactions (type = \"Purchase\"):\n1. Purchase20231231001: $800,000 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment B)\n2. Purchase20231231002: $2,000,000 (2 units of Heavy Equipment C)\n3. Purchase20231231003: $800,000 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment B)\n4. Purchase20231231004: $1,000,000 (2 units of Heavy Equipment A)\n5. Purchase20231231005: $3,000,000 (2 units of Heavy Equipment D)\n6. Purchase20231231006: $800,000 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment B)\n7. Purchase20231231007: $800,000 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment B)\n8. Purchase20231231008: $3,000,000 (2 units of Heavy Equipment D)\n9. Purchase20231231009: $1,000,000 (2 units of Heavy Equipment A)\n10. Purchase20231231010: $2,000,000 (2 units of Heavy Equipment C)\n11. Purchase20231231011: $1,000,000 (2 units of Heavy Equipment A) - Unpaid\n12. Purchase20231231012: $3,000,000 (2 units of Heavy Equipment D)\n\nTotal purchases = $800,000 + $2,000,000 + $800,000 + $1,000,000 + $3,000,000 + $800,000 + $800,000 + $3,000,000 + $1,000,000 + $2,000,000 + $3,000,000 = $18,200,000\n\n### Step 2: Identify all sale transactions (inventory reductions)\nFrom the data, we can see the following sale transactions (type = \"Sale\"):\n1. Sale20240103001: $1,126,403.16 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment B) - cost $800,000\n2. Sale20240106004: $684,558.74 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment A) - cost $500,000\n3. Sale20240107005: $1,354,106.17 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment C) - cost $1,000,000\n4. Sale20240108008: $1,081,910.15 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment B) - cost $800,000\n5. Sale20240109009: $2,070,499.57 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment D) - cost $1,500,000\n6. Sale20240111011: $2,215,044.89 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment D) - cost $1,500,000\n7. Sale20240117017: $703,009.17 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment A) - cost $500,000\n8. Sale20240122024: $652,509.01 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment A) - cost $500,000\n9. Sale20240124028: $736,928.63 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment A) - cost $500,000\n10. Sale20240125030: $1,318,422.35 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment C) - cost $1,000,000\n11. Sale20240129034: $1,952,322.13 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment D) - cost $1,500,000\n12. Sale20240131038: $2,022,547.30 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment D) - cost $1,500,000\n13. Sale20240205042: $2,144,176.18 (1 unit of Heavy Equipment D) - cost $1,500,000\n\nTotal cost of goods sold = $800,000 + $500,000 + $1,000,000 + $800,000 + $1,500,000 + $1,500,000 + $500,000 + $500,000 + $500,000 + $1,000,000 + $1,500,000 + $1,500,000 + $1,500,000 = $12,600,000\n\n### Step 3: Calculate inventory change\nInventory change = Total purchases - Cost of goods sold\n= $18,200,000 - $12,600,000 = $5,600,000\n\nSince inventory increased, this will be shown as a negative amount in the cash flow statement (as it represents cash outflow for inventory that hasn't been sold yet).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-5600000.00'}}\n```",
