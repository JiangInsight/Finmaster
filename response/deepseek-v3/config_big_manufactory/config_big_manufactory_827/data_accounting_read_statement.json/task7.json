This represents the total depreciation expense accumulated over time.\n\n2. **Extract the initial and end values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `138957.79` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Format the solution**:\n   - The solution should be presented in the specified JSON format with the initial and end values for the identified expense line item.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '138957.79'} }\n```",
