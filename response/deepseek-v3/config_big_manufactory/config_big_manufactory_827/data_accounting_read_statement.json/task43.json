This value represents the amount of cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the cash flow statement, the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section is clearly marked. Under this section, the \"Beginning Balance\" is listed.\n\n3. **Identify the Value**: From the table, the \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" is listed as \"20000000.00\" on the date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Beginning Balance\" is indeed the starting amount of cash and cash equivalents before any cash flows (operating, investing, or financing activities) are accounted for during the period.\n\n5. **Extract the Value**: The value to be extracted is \"20000000.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20000000.00'}}\n```",
