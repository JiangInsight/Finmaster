This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the value that represents the increase in accounts payable, which indicates the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is found under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is \"1000000.00\".\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: This value is positive, indicating an increase in accounts payable, which aligns with the task's requirement to identify the addition in the amount owed.\n\n5. **Prepare the Solution**: The solution is the extracted value from the line item.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1000000.00'}}\n```",
