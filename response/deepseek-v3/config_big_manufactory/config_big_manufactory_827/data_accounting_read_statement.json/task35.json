                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract four specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these are costs related to selling products or services, which includes marketing, sales commissions, shipping, etc.\n   \n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expense\" in the income statement, representing costs like interest on loans.\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is straightforwardly called \"Depreciation\" in the income statement.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is the \"Tax Expense\" line in the income statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\nLet's look at the provided income statement and pick out these items:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 18062437.45 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 18062437.45 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 13100000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost | 13100000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit | 4962437.45 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 863669.20 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Selling Expenses** | **1468071.54** | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Depreciation** | **138957.79** | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Financial Expenses** | **351260.94** | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses | 2821959.47 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income | 13555.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 2154033.87 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Tax Expense** | **903121.89** | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit | 1250911.98 | 2024-02-05 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\n1. **Selling Expenses**: This is the cost to secure orders and deliver goods/services. From the table, it's **1468071.54**.\n2. **Depreciation**: The systematic allocation of asset costs. Found as **138957.79**.\n3. **Financial Expenses**: Costs to raise funds. Listed as **351260.94**.\n4. **Tax Expense**: Total taxes expected to pay/recover. It's **903121.89**.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe example provided shows the order as:\n- value1: Selling Expenses\n- value2: Depreciation\n- value3: Financial Expenses\n- value4: Tax Expense\n\nThis matches our identification above.\n\n### Final Answer\nPlugging in the values we've identified:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1468071.54', 'value2': '138957.79', 'value3': '351260.94', 'value4': '903121.89'} }\n```\n\n### Double-Checking\nJust to ensure accuracy:\n- Selling Expenses: 1,468,071.54 笨能n- Depreciation: 138,957.79 笨能n- Financial Expenses: 351,260.94 笨能n- Tax Expense: 903,121.89 笨能n\nAll values are correctly identified and in the right order as per the example. \n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully reviewing the income statement and matching each required line item with its corresponding value, the final solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1468071.54', 'value2': '138957.79', 'value3': '351260.94', 'value4': '903121.89'} }\n```",
