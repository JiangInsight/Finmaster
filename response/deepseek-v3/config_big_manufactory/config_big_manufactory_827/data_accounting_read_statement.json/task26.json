In an income statement, these are usually listed under \"Financial Expenses\" or similar terms.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Given Income Statement**: Looking at the provided income statement, we can see a line item labeled \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of \"351260.94\" dated \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Verification**: \n   - The \"Financial Expenses\" line item is directly related to the costs of raising funds.\n   - No other line items (like \"Interest Income\") represent costs; they are either revenues or other types of expenses.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of financing costs is correctly represented by the \"Financial Expenses\" line item.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '351260.94'} }\n```",
