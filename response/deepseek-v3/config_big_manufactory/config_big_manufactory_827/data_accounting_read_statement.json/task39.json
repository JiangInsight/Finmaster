A negative value indicates an increase in inventory (which is a use of cash), and a positive value would indicate a decrease in inventory (a source of cash). \n\nLooking at the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" has a value of \"-6100000.00\". This indicates an increase in inventory, which corresponds to a reduction in cash flow due to more assets being held for sale or in production.\n\nThus, the value to extract is \"-6100000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-6100000.00'} }\n```",
