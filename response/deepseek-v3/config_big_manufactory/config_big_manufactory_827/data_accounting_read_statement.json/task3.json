This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Receivable\" represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit. This is the item we need to extract.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and End Values**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item has:\n     - Initial_amount: `0.00` (as of the Initial_date: `2023-12-31`)\n     - End_amount: `10537836.59` (as of the End_date: `2024-02-05`)\n\n3. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00`.\n   - The end value is `10537836.59`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '10537836.59'} }\n```",
