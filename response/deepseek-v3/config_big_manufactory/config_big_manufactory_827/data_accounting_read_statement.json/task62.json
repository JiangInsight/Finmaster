I'm going to identify and extract three specific line items from the given financial statements based on the task description. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three values:\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually \"Financial Expenses\" in the Income Statement.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order of extraction is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### Extracting the Values\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet - Accounts Receivable\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we have:\n```\n| Accounts Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 10537836.59 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" for Accounts Receivable is **10537836.59**. This is the amount owed to the entity at the end of the period.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement - Financial Expenses\nIn the Income Statement:\n```\n| Financial Expenses | 351260.94 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe amount for Financial Expenses is **351260.94**. This represents the financing costs incurred.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Purchase of Fixed Assets\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 2496021.60 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\nThe cash payment for acquiring fixed assets is **2496021.60**.\n\n### Verifying the Values\nLet me double-check to ensure these are the correct line items:\n- **Accounts Receivable**: Yes, it's the amount customers owe for credit sales.\n- **Financial Expenses**: Correct, these are costs related to financing (like interest on loans).\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: Yes, this is the cash outflow for buying long-term assets.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10537836.59', 'value2': '351260.94', 'value3': '2496021.60'} }\n```",
