This line item represents the cash outflow for acquiring PP&E and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `2496021.60`.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is `-2496021.60`, which confirms that the only cash outflow in this section is the purchase of fixed assets, as there are no other line items listed under investing activities.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2496021.60'}}\n```",
