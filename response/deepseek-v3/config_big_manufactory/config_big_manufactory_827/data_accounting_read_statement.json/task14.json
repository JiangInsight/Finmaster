These are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the entity's normal operating cycle, usually within one year. In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\".\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" line provides the sum of all current liabilities.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is given as \"0.00\" on the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n   - **End Value**: The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is given as \"1903121.89\" on the \"End_date\" of \"2024-02-05\".\n\n3. **Verify the Calculation**:\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the sum of \"Accounts Payable\" (1000000.00) and \"Taxes Payable\" (903121.89), which equals 1903121.89. This matches the \"End_amount\" provided for \"Total Current Liabilities\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1903121.89'} }\n```",
