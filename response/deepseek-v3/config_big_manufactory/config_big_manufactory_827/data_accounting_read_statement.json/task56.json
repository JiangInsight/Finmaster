This refers to the depreciation expense recorded in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Depreciation**: Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. It is recorded as an expense in the income statement and also appears in the accumulated depreciation account on the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Locating Depreciation in the Financial Statements**:\n   - **Income Statement**: The depreciation expense is explicitly listed under expenses.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: Depreciation is added back to net profit in the cash flow from operating activities section because it is a non-cash expense.\n   - **Balance Sheet**: The accumulated depreciation is listed under fixed assets, representing the total depreciation accumulated over time.\n\n3. **Extracting the Value**:\n   - In the provided **income statement**, the \"Depreciation\" line item shows a value of `138957.79`.\n   - This value matches the \"Depreciation\" line item in the **cash flow statement** (`138957.79`).\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" in the **balance sheet** also shows `138957.79`, which is the total depreciation accumulated up to the end date.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The depreciation expense for the period is `138957.79`, which is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of the asset over its useful life.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '138957.79'}}\n```",
