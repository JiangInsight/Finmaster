These are typically referred to as \"Current Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the normal operating cycle of the business. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all such assets.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is `20000000.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is `20796970.06` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Verify Non-Current Assets**: For completeness, we can note that \"Total Non-current Assets\" are not part of the operating cycle and are thus excluded from the solution.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '20000000.00', 'end value': '20796970.06'} }\n```",
