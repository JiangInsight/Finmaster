In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit.\"\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFrom the given problem, we can locate these two line items and their corresponding amounts:\n\n- **Net Profit**: 1250911.98\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 2496021.60\n\nThese values are found in the \"Amount\" column next to their respective line items in the cash flow statement.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1250911.98', 'value2': '2496021.60'} }\n```",
