The line item that represents tax accrued but not yet paid is typically labeled as \"Taxes Payable\" in the liabilities section of the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: \n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet. This represents the tax that has been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Taxes Payable\" is given as \"0.00\" with the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Taxes Payable\" is given as \"903121.89\" with the end date \"2024-02-05\".\n\n4. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - The initial value is \"0.00\".\n   - The end value is \"903121.89\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '903121.89'} }\n```",
