In the given problem, this is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the value \"18062437.45\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or similar line item that represents the cost associated with the goods sold during the period. In the given problem, this is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the value \"13100000.00\".\n\nThese two line items are the first two relevant items in the income statement, and they are in the original order as shown in the input statement.\n\nHere is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '18062437.45', 'value2': '13100000.00'}}\n```",
