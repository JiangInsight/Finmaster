                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break down the task to understand what each of the four values we need to extract represents, and then locate them in the given cash flow statement.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task asks us to identify and extract four specific line items from the cash flow statement based on their descriptions. Here's what each one corresponds to:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is the **Depreciation** expense. It's the amount by which the value of an asset is reduced over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, etc.\n\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This refers to the change in **Inventory**. If inventory decreases, it means the company has sold some of its stock; if it increases, it means the company has produced or purchased more than it sold.\n\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends**: This is the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**. It includes cash spent on buying fixed assets (like property, plant, and equipment) and cash received from selling such assets or from investments.\n\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is the **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents. It shows the overall change in the company's cash position during the period.\n\n### Locating the Values in the Given Statement\n\nNow, let's go through the provided cash flow statement to find these four items.\n\n1. **Depreciation**:\n   - Looking at the \"Account\" column, we see \"Depreciation\" with an amount of \"138957.79\".\n\n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**:\n   - There's a line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with an amount of \"-6100000.00\". The negative sign indicates an increase in inventory (since it's an outflow), but the description asks for the \"reduction\" in inventory, which would be the opposite. However, the example given shows that we take the value as is, even if it's negative. So, we'll take \"-6100000.00\".\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - Under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", there's \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with \"-2496021.60\".\n\n4. **Net Increase** in cash and cash equivalents:\n   - Under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\", there's \"Net Increase\" with \"-15854422.42\".\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the example provided:\n\n- value1: Depreciation = 45751.41\n- value2: (Increase) Decrease in Inventory = -5090000.00\n- value3: Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -305354.43\n- value4: Net Increase = -7565348.53\n\nThis matches our understanding, so we're on the right track.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nNow, let's plug in the values we've identified:\n\n1. value1 (Depreciation): 138957.79\n2. value2 ((Increase) Decrease in Inventory): -6100000.00\n3. value3 (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities): -2496021.60\n4. value4 (Net Increase): -15854422.42\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '138957.79', 'value2': '-6100000.00', 'value3': '-2496021.60', 'value4': '-15854422.42'} }\n```",
