The relevant line item is \"Bank Deposits,\" which shows the initial and final amounts of money deposited in the bank.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant line item**: Look for the \"Bank Deposits\" row in the balance sheet. This row contains the information about the funds deposited into the bank.\n2. **Extract the initial value**: The \"Initial_amount\" column for \"Bank Deposits\" shows the amount of money deposited at the beginning of the period.\n3. **Extract the end value**: The \"End_amount\" column for \"Bank Deposits\" shows the amount of money deposited at the end of the period.\n\nFrom the given balance sheet:\n- **Bank Deposits**:\n  - Initial_amount: 15000000.00\n  - End_amount: 1103978.40\n\nThus, the initial value is '15000000.00', and the end value is '1103978.40'.\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '15000000.00', 'end value': '1103978.40'}}\n```",
