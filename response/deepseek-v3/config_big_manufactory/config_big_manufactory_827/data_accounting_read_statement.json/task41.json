In cash flow statements, this is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we look for the line item related to tax payable. The line item is: \n   - \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of \"903121.89\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: This line item is indeed under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, which is the correct section for such adjustments related to taxes accrued but not yet paid.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"903121.89\", which represents the increase in tax payable (i.e., tax accrued but not yet paid).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '903121.89'} }\n```",
