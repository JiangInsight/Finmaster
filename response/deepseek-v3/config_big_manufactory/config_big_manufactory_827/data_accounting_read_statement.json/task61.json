                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the correct values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe're given three financial statements: a balance sheet, an income statement, and a cash flow statement. The task is to extract two specific line items and their values:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.**\n2. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.**\n\nThese values need to be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems that:\n\n- The first value (`value1`) corresponds to \"costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\"\n- The second value (`value2`) corresponds to \"cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\"\n\nIn the example, `value1` was \"Selling Expenses\" from the income statement, and `value2` was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" from the cash flow statement.\n\n### Identifying the Line Items\n\nNow, let's identify where these values are in the given problem.\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers:**\n   - This is typically related to \"Selling Expenses\" in the income statement. Selling expenses are costs associated with selling products, which would include securing orders and delivering goods/services.\n   - In the income statement provided, we have \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of \"1468071.54\".\n\n2. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets:**\n   - This is usually found in the cash flow statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar, as it represents cash spent on long-term assets.\n   - In the cash flow statement provided, we have \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of \"2496021.60\".\n\n### Verifying Against the Example\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\n- `value1` was \"Selling Expenses\" from the income statement.\n- `value2` was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" from the cash flow statement.\n\nThis matches our identification above.\n\n### Checking Other Financial Statements\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check if these values appear in other statements:\n\n- **Balance Sheet:**\n  - Doesn't seem to have any line items directly matching the descriptions.\n  \n- **Income Statement:**\n  - \"Selling Expenses\" is present, which fits `value1`.\n  \n- **Cash Flow Statement:**\n  - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is present, which fits `value2`.\n\nNo other line items seem to match these descriptions more closely.\n\n### Finalizing the Values\n\nTherefore:\n\n- `value1`: \"Selling Expenses\" = \"1468071.54\"\n- `value2`: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = \"2496021.60\"\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe solution should be presented in JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1468071.54', 'value2': '2496021.60'}}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing each financial statement and matching the descriptions to the appropriate line items, the correct values are:\n\n- `value1` (Selling Expenses): 1468071.54\n- `value2` (Purchase of Fixed Assets): 2496021.60\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1468071.54', 'value2': '2496021.60'}}\n```",
