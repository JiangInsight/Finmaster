I'm going to go through the balance sheet provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their initial and end amounts. \n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract the following four line items from the balance sheet:\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically listed as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n2. **Accumulated depreciation**: This is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, listed as \"Accumulated Depreciation\".\n3. **Tax payable**: This is the amount of taxes that the company owes but hasn't paid yet, listed as \"Taxes Payable\".\n4. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is the amount shareholders have invested in the company, usually listed as \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\n### Analyzing the Given Balance Sheet\nLet's look at the provided balance sheet and find these items:\n\n1. **Interest Receivable**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 13555.89\n\n2. **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 138957.79\n\n3. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - Initial_amount: 0.00\n   - End_amount: 903121.89\n\n4. **Paid-in Capital**:\n   - Initial_amount: 28000000.00\n   - End_amount: 28000000.00\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe order in which these items appear in the balance sheet is:\n1. Interest Receivable\n2. Accumulated Depreciation\n3. Taxes Payable\n4. Paid-in Capital\n\nThis matches the order we're supposed to maintain in our output.\n\n### Constructing the Solution\nNow, let's assign these values to the corresponding keys in the solution JSON:\n\n- 'initial value1': Interest Receivable initial amount → '0.00'\n- 'end valu1': Interest Receivable end amount → '13555.89'\n- 'initial value2': Accumulated Depreciation initial amount → '0.00'\n- 'end valu2': Accumulated Depreciation end amount → '138957.79'\n- 'initial value3': Taxes Payable initial amount → '0.00'\n- 'end valu3': Taxes Payable end amount → '903121.89'\n- 'initial value4': Paid-in Capital initial amount → '28000000.00'\n- 'end valu4': Paid-in Capital end amount → '28000000.00'\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '13555.89', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '138957.79', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '903121.89', 'initial value4': '28000000.00', 'end valu4': '28000000.00'} }\n```",
