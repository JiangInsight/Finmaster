                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract two specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **End value of funds deposited into a bank**: This is typically found under \"Bank Deposits\" in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Income earned by an entity from financial assets**: This is typically found under \"Interest Income\" in the Income Statement.\n\nLet's go through the steps to find these values:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the \"Bank Deposits\" in the Balance Sheet\n- In the Balance Sheet section, look for the line item \"Bank Deposits\".\n- The \"End_amount\" for \"Bank Deposits\" is the value we need for 'value1'.\n- From the given Balance Sheet:\n  - Bank Deposits | 15000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | **1103978.40** | 2024-02-05\n  - So, 'value1' = '1103978.40'\n\n### Step 2: Identify the \"Interest Income\" in the Income Statement\n- In the Income Statement section, look for the line item \"Interest Income\".\n- The \"Amount\" for \"Interest Income\" is the value we need for 'value2'.\n- From the given Income Statement:\n  - Interest Income | **13555.89** | 2024-02-05\n  - So, 'value2' = '13555.89'\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Cash Flow Statement (if needed)\n- The Cash Flow Statement is not directly needed for this task, but it can be used to cross-verify the \"Interest Receivable\" changes if necessary. However, since we already have the \"Interest Income\" from the Income Statement, this step is optional.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1103978.40', 'value2': '13555.89'} }\n```",
