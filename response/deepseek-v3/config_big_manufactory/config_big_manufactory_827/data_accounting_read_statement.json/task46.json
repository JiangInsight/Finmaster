Specifically, we need to:\n\n1. **Identify and extract the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from investing activities**. This typically involves activities like the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents, as well as the receipt of interest and dividends.\n\n2. **Decompose this net amount into its component sub-items**, all of which must come from the input statement. For each sub-item, we need to provide its final value.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n```plaintext\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 1250911.98 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 138957.79 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -10537836.59 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -13555.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -6100000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 1000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 903121.89 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -13358400.82 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 2496021.60 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -2496021.60 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 20000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 4145577.58 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -15854422.42 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\n### Identifying the Relevant Section\n\nThe section we're interested in is **\"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"**. This section includes:\n\n1. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This is an outflow of cash, hence the positive amount indicates cash spent.\n2. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This is the net result of all investing activities, which in this case is just the purchase of fixed assets.\n\n### Extracting the Net Amount\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: -2496021.60\n\nThis is the net amount generated from investing activities. A negative value indicates that more cash was spent than generated in investing activities.\n\n### Decomposing into Sub-items\n\nThe only sub-item listed under investing activities is:\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 2496021.60\n\nThis is the amount spent on purchasing fixed assets, which is the sole component contributing to the net cash flow from investing activities in this statement.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nThe net cash flow from investing activities is calculated as the sum of all investing activities. Here, it's just the purchase of fixed assets:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: +2496021.60 (cash outflow)\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -2496021.60\n\nThis checks out because spending on fixed assets reduces cash, hence the negative net cash flow.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n\n- **value**: The net amount is \"-2496021.60\".\n- **sub_items**: The only sub-item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of \"2496021.60\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2496021.60\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"2496021.60\"}}}\n```\n\n### Comparing with the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-305354.43', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '305354.43'}}}\n```\n\nOur solution follows the same structure:\n- The net value is negative (indicating cash outflow).\n- The sub-item is positive, representing the actual cash spent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the cash flow statement and understanding the components of investing activities, we've identified and decomposed the relevant figures accurately.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-2496021.60\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"2496021.60\"}}}\n```",
