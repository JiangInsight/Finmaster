This is because COGS represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, which includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods, and the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\n2. **Locating the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is explicitly listed with an amount of \"13100000.00\".\n\n3. **Verification**: The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is also reflected under \"Total Cost\" with the same value, confirming that this is the correct line item to extract.\n\n4. **Extracting the Value**: The value to be extracted is \"13100000.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '13100000.00'}}\n```",
