This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity by customers for credit sales.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-10537836.59.\" A negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., more amounts are owed to the entity), while a positive value would indicate a decrease (i.e., less amounts are owed to the entity). Since the task asks for the \"decrease in amounts owed,\" we are interested in the value itself, regardless of its sign.\n4. **Format the Answer**: The solution should be presented in the specified JSON format with the extracted value.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-10537836.59'}}\n```",
