These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and are not meant for short-term use or conversion into cash within the operating cycle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or the normal operating cycle of the business. In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Total Non-current Assets\" represent these assets.\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is given as \"8000000.00\" under \"Total Non-current Assets\" for the initial date (2023-12-31).\n   - The end value of non-current assets is given as \"10357063.81\" under \"Total Non-current Assets\" for the end date (2024-02-05).\n\n2. **Verify the Line Items**:\n   - The non-current assets include \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation\". The net value of these is reflected in \"Total Non-current Assets\".\n   - Fixed Assets initial value: 8000000.00, end value: 10496021.60.\n   - Accumulated Depreciation initial value: 0.00, end value: 138957.79.\n   - Net Fixed Assets (end value): 10496021.60 - 138957.79 = 10357063.81, which matches the \"Total Non-current Assets\" end value.\n\n3. **Exclude Current Assets**:\n   - Current assets (like Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Accounts Receivable, Inventory) are intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle and are not included in the solution.\n\n4. **Final Values**:\n   - Initial value of non-current assets: 8000000.00.\n   - End value of non-current assets: 10357063.81.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10357063.81'}}\n```",
