I'm going to approach this methodically to ensure I extract the correct line items as specified in the task description.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the provided financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Paid-in Capital\" or similar equity accounts.\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable,\" which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each financial statement one by one.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we're interested in the \"Paid-in Capital\" line, which represents capital contributed by shareholders.\n\n- **Paid-in Capital**: \n  - Initial_amount: 28000000.00\n  - End_amount: 28000000.00\n  - Since the initial and end amounts are the same, there's no change, but the capital contributed is 28000000.00.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nHere, we're looking for \"Profit Before Tax.\"\n\n- **Profit Before Tax**: 2154033.87\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nWe need the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable,\" which shows the addition to the amount owed for goods/services on credit.\n\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: 1000000.00\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe task specifies the order should be:\n\n1. Balance Sheet (Paid-in Capital)\n2. Income Statement (Profit Before Tax)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Increase in Accounts Payable)\n\nThis matches the order we've identified.\n\n### Final Extraction\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders (Paid-in Capital)**: '28000000.00'\n2. **Profit before tax**: '2154033.87'\n3. **Increase in Accounts Payable**: '1000000.00'\n\n### Checking Against the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- The example had:\n  - Paid-in Capital: '13000000.00'\n  - Profit Before Tax: '-1373590.51'\n  - Increase in Accounts Payable: '1590000.00'\n\nThis confirms that we're following the correct approach.\n\n### Potential Pitfalls\n\n- **Accounts Payable in Balance Sheet vs. Cash Flow**: The increase in Accounts Payable is more accurately reflected in the Cash Flow Statement, not just the ending balance in the Balance Sheet.\n- **Profit Before Tax vs. Net Profit**: It's important not to confuse \"Profit Before Tax\" with \"Net Profit,\" which is after tax.\n- **Paid-in Capital Changes**: If there were changes during the period, we might need to consider that, but here it's constant.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully extracting the required values from each financial statement in the specified order, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '2154033.87', 'value3': '1000000.00'}}\n```",
