This information is typically found under \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Retained Earnings\" represents the accumulated profits or losses retained in the entity and not distributed to shareholders.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Retained Earnings\" is provided as \"0.00\" under the \"Initial_amount\" column for the \"Retained Earnings\" row.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Retained Earnings\" is provided as \"1250911.98\" under the \"End_amount\" column for the \"Retained Earnings\" row.\n\n4. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value is correct as it shows no retained earnings at the start of the period.\n   - The end value is correct as it shows the accumulated retained earnings at the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1250911.98'} }\n```",
