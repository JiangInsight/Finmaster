In the given problem, both \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" have the same value, so either can be used. We will use \"Main Business Revenue\" as it is more specific.\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item, as it reflects the cost associated with the inventory sold during the period.\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: This is represented by the \"Administrative Expenses\" line item, as it covers the costs related to general management and administration.\n\nNow, let's extract the values from the given income statement:\n\n- **Main Business Revenue**: 18062437.45\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 13100000.00\n- **Administrative Expenses**: 863669.20\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '18062437.45', 'value2': '13100000.00', 'value3': '863669.20'} }\n```",
