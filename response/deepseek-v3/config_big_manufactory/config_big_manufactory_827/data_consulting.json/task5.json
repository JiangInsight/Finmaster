                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Gross Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"Gross Profit Margin\" means. From what I recall, the Gross Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods and services.\n\nThe formula for Gross Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Gross Profit** = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n- **Total Revenue** is the total income from sales before any expenses are deducted.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n1. **Total Revenue**: 18,062,437.45\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 13,100,000.00\n3. **Gross Profit**: 4,962,437.45\n\nWait a minute, the Gross Profit is already given as 4,962,437.45. That's good; it saves me a step of calculating it. But just to verify, let's calculate it:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{COGS} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit} = 18,062,437.45 - 13,100,000.00 = 4,962,437.45 \\]\n\nYes, that matches the given Gross Profit. So, we can proceed with the given numbers.\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nNow, plug the numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{4,962,437.45}{18,062,437.45} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide Gross Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,962,437.45}{18,062,437.45} \\approx 0.2747 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.2747 \\times 100 \\approx 27.47\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nLet me double-check the division to ensure accuracy:\n\n\\[ 4,962,437.45 \\div 18,062,437.45 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n- 18,062,437.45 goes into 4,962,437.45 zero times, so it's less than 1.\n- 18,062,437.45 × 0.2 = 3,612,487.49\n- Subtract from Gross Profit: 4,962,437.45 - 3,612,487.49 = 1,349,949.96\n- Now, 18,062,437.45 × 0.07 = 1,264,370.62\n- Subtract: 1,349,949.96 - 1,264,370.62 = 85,579.34\n- 18,062,437.45 × 0.004 ≈ 72,249.75 (too much)\n- 18,062,437.45 × 0.003 ≈ 54,187.31\n- 85,579.34 - 54,187.31 = 31,392.03\n- Continuing this way, it's converging to approximately 0.2747.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Gross Profit Margin is approximately 27.47%.\n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '27.47%'}}\n```\n\n### Comparing with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Gross Profit: 1,021,018.59\n- Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Gross Profit Margin: (1,021,018.59 / 5,431,018.59) × 100 ≈ 18.80%\n\nThis matches the given solution of 18.80%, so my method aligns with the example.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully calculating and verifying each step, the Gross Profit Margin for the given income statement is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '27.47%'}}\n```",
