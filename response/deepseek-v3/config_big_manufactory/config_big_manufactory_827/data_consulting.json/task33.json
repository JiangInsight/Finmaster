                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each ratio, explain what it means, and then calculate it step by step.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82\n- Current Liabilities (from balance sheet) = 1,903,121.89\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,903,121.89} \\approx -7.02 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to find Total Liabilities. From the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no long-term liabilities listed) = 1,903,121.89\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,903,121.89} \\approx -7.02 \\]\n\n*Note: This seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio because the company has no long-term debt; all liabilities are current.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 13,100,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Ending Inventory = 6,100,000.00\n- Initial Inventory (assuming it's zero since it's not given, but from the initial balance sheet, Inventory starts at 0) = 0.00\n\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (0 + 6,100,000) / 2 = 3,050,000.00\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{13,100,000.00}{3,050,000.00} \\approx 4.30 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute, in the initial balance sheet, Inventory is 0 at the start, and at the end it's 6,100,000. So average is 3,050,000. But is this correct? Maybe the initial amount is not zero? Looking back at the initial balance sheet, Inventory starts at 0, so this seems correct.*\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholder equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,250,911.98\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,903,121.89}{29,250,911.98} \\approx 0.065 \\]\n\n*This seems very low, which indicates the company is not heavily leveraged.*\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 20,796,970.06\n- Inventory = 6,100,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{20,796,970.06 - 6,100,000.00}{1,903,121.89} = \\frac{14,696,970.06}{1,903,121.89} \\approx 7.72 \\]\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 20,796,970.06\n- Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{20,796,970.06}{1,903,121.89} \\approx 10.93 \\]\n\n### Summary of Calculations:\n1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -7.02\n2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -7.02\n3. Inventory Turnover Ratio: 4.30\n4. Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.065\n5. Quick Ratio: 7.72\n6. Current Ratio: 10.93\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the ratios seem to be rounded to two decimal places, and some might be calculated slightly differently (e.g., Inventory Turnover might use only ending inventory if beginning is zero). \n\nLet me double-check Inventory Turnover:\nIf we use only ending inventory (as beginning is zero), then:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Ending Inventory}} = \\frac{13,100,000}{6,100,000} \\approx 2.15 \\]\n\nThis seems more plausible because average inventory would be half, making the ratio higher, but if beginning is zero, using ending might be more standard.\n\nSimilarly, Debt to Equity is very low at 0.065, which might round to 0.07.\n\nBut the example had Inventory Turnover as 1.73 when COGS was 4,410,000 and Inventory was 5,090,000 (assuming ending), so 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.87, which doesn't match. Maybe they used average inventory: (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000, then 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73. So average seems correct.\n\nSo for our case, average inventory is 3,050,000, COGS is 13,100,000, so 13,100,000 / 3,050,000 ≈ 4.30.\n\nSimilarly, in the example, Debt to Equity was Total Liabilities (1,861,550.92) / Total Equity (11,354,858.57) ≈ 0.16.\n\nIn our case, it's 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.065, so maybe it's correct.\n\nQuick Ratio in example: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities = (7,956,806.47 - 5,090,000) / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54.\n\nOur Quick Ratio is (20,796,970.06 - 6,100,000) / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 14,696,970.06 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 7.72.\n\nCurrent Ratio in example: 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.27.\n\nOur Current Ratio: 20,796,970.06 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 10.93.\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio in example: Net Operating Cash Flow (-7,259,994.10) / Current Liabilities (1,861,550.92) ≈ -3.90.\n\nOur Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ -7.02.\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio in example: same as Operating Cash Flow Ratio because total liabilities are current liabilities.\n\nSame for us: -7.02.\n\nSo, final answers seem correct based on calculations.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-7.02', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-7.02', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '4.30', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Quick Ratio': '7.72', 'Current Ratio': '10.93'}}\n```\n\n*Note: Debt to Equity Ratio rounded to 0.07 from 0.065.*",
