                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 20,796,970.06\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 1,903,121.89\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 20,796,970.06 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 10.93\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 3,041,599.18\n- Bank Deposits = 1,103,978.40\n- Interest Receivable = 13,555.89\n- Accounts Receivable = 10,537,836.59\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 + 13,555.89 + 10,537,836.59 ≈ 14,696,970.06\n\nQuick Ratio = 14,696,970.06 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 7.72\n\n*Wait a minute*, usually the Quick Ratio excludes inventory and sometimes interest receivable if it's not readily convertible to cash. Let me check the standard definition.\n\nStandard Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable\nHere, Marketable Securities might not be listed separately, but Bank Deposits are likely cash equivalents. Interest Receivable might not be included unless it's very short-term and certain.\n\nAssuming:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 + 10,537,836.59 ≈ 14,683,414.17\n\nQuick Ratio = 14,683,414.17 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 7.71\n\n(Almost the same as before, so including interest receivable doesn't change much. I'll go with 7.72 for consistency with initial calculation.)\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 1,903,121.89\n- Total Assets = 31,154,033.87\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,903,121.89 / 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.061\n\n*Wait*, is Total Liabilities only current liabilities here? The balance sheet shows:\nTotal Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\nNo other liabilities are listed, so Total Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,250,911.98\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.065\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ -7.02\n\n*But*, is Total Debt the same as Total Liabilities here? Since there's no long-term debt, it's just current liabilities. Maybe the ratio is meant to use total liabilities as debt.\n\n### Verifying Calculations:\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure no mistakes.\n\n- Current Ratio: 20,796,970.06 / 1,903,121.89 = 10.93 (correct)\n- Quick Ratio: (3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 + 10,537,836.59) / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 14,683,414.17 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 7.72 (correct)\n- Debt to Asset: 1,903,121.89 / 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.061 (correct)\n- Debt to Equity: 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.065 (correct)\n- Cash Flow to Debt: -13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ -7.02 (correct)\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '10.93', 'Quick Ratio': '7.72', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-7.02'} }\n```\n\n*Note:* The ratios are rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the example provided. The exact values might have more decimal places, but this level of precision is standard for financial reporting.\n\n### Potential Adjustments:\nIf \"Total Debt\" is considered differently (e.g., only interest-bearing debt), but here all liabilities seem to be operational (accounts payable, taxes payable), so total liabilities are used as debt. If there's an expectation to exclude certain liabilities, the ratios might adjust, but based on given data, this seems correct.",
