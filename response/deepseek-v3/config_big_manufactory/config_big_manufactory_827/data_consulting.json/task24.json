                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Net Cash Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n   \\]\n   A higher ratio indicates more leverage and higher financial risk.\n\n2. **Net Cash Ratio**: This ratio assesses a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its cash and cash equivalents. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   It shows how much cash is available to cover short-term obligations.\n\n### Extracting Necessary Data from the Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each statement to find the numbers we need.\n\n#### Balance Sheet (End of Period - 2024-02-05)\n\n- **Total Assets**: 31,154,033.87\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 1,903,121.89\n  - This includes:\n    - Accounts Payable: 1,000,000.00\n    - Taxes Payable: 903,121.89\n- **Total Liabilities**: \n  - From the balance sheet, it seems the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities\" (1,903,121.89). There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so:\n    - Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n  - Cash on Hand: 3,041,599.18\n  - Bank Deposits: 1,103,978.40\n  - Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 = 4,145,577.58\n    - This matches the \"Ending Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" in the cash flow statement.\n\n#### Cash Flow Statement\n\n- Confirming Cash and Cash Equivalents:\n  - Ending Balance: 4,145,577.58 (matches our calculation above)\n  \n#### Income Statement\n\n- Not directly needed for these ratios, but good to glance at profitability for context.\n\n### Calculating the Ratios\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{1,903,121.89}{31,154,033.87}\n   \\]\n   Let's do the division:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1,903,121.89}{31,154,033.87} \\approx 0.0611\n   \\]\n   So, approximately 0.061 or 6.11%.\n\n   Wait a minute, in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as '0.14', which is 14%. Let me double-check if I'm missing any liabilities.\n\n   Looking back at the balance sheet:\n   - Under liabilities, only \"Total Current Liabilities\" is listed at 1,903,121.89.\n   - There's no mention of long-term debt or other non-current liabilities.\n   - So, total liabilities seem to be just the current liabilities.\n\n   Maybe the example included some other liabilities not explicitly listed, but in this problem, it seems straightforward. So, I'll proceed with 0.061.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps \"Debt\" in \"Debt to Asset Ratio\" refers only to interest-bearing debt, but here, Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable are not interest-bearing. Maybe only the \"Financial Expenses\" related liabilities are considered, but those aren't listed separately in liabilities.\n\n   Given the information, I think it's correct to use total current liabilities as total debt unless specified otherwise. Maybe the example had more liabilities.\n\n   For this problem, since only current liabilities are given, and no long-term debt is mentioned, the ratio is ~0.061.\n\n   But to match the format, maybe it's rounded to two decimal places: 0.06.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe I'm missing that \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" is 31,154,033.87, and \"Total Owner's Equity\" is 29,250,911.98, so:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity} - \\text{Total Owner's Equity} = 31,154,033.87 - 29,250,911.98 = 1,903,121.89\n   \\]\n   Which matches the current liabilities. So, seems correct.\n\n   Maybe the example had other liabilities not shown. I'll proceed with 0.06.\n\n2. **Net Cash Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{4,145,577.58}{1,903,121.89}\n   \\]\n   Calculating:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4,145,577.58}{1,903,121.89} \\approx 2.178\n   \\]\n   So, approximately 2.18.\n\n   This means the company has about 2.18 times more cash than its current liabilities, indicating strong liquidity.\n\n### Verifying Against the Example\n\nIn the example:\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.14 (14%)\n  - Total Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n  - Total Assets: 13,216,409.49\n  - Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: 4.41\n  - Not the same as Net Cash Ratio, so maybe different.\n\nOur problem asks for Net Cash Ratio, not Operating Cash Flow to Net Income, so we're calculating correctly.\n\n### Final Calculations\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: ~0.06\n- Net Cash Ratio: ~2.18\n\n### Presenting the Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Net Cash Ratio': '2.18'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example's Debt to Asset Ratio was '0.14', which is Total Liabilities / Total Assets. In our case, it's 1,903,121.89 / 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.061, so '0.06' seems correct when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nSimilarly, Net Cash Ratio is Cash / Current Liabilities = 4,145,577.58 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 2.18.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Net Cash Ratio': '2.18'} }\n```",
