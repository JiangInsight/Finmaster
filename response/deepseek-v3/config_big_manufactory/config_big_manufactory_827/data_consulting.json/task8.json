                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Cash Ratio based on the provided cash flow statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Net Cash Ratio is. From what I recall, the Net Cash Ratio is a measure of a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its cash and cash equivalents. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nHowever, looking at the provided example, the solution given is the 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio', which is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nGiven that the example's solution is labeled differently from the task's request for the Net Cash Ratio, I'm a bit confused. Maybe there's a mislabeling in the example. \n\nBut since the task specifically asks for the Net Cash Ratio, and the example seems to calculate a different ratio, I'll proceed with the standard definition of the Net Cash Ratio.\n\n### Identifying the Necessary Components\n\nFrom the cash flow statement provided, we have:\n\n1. **Cash and Cash Equivalents - Ending Balance**: This is the cash available at the end of the period.\n   - Ending Balance: 4,145,577.58\n\n2. **Current Liabilities**: This isn't directly provided in the cash flow statement. Typically, current liabilities include items like accounts payable, tax payable, etc., which are listed under operating activities.\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 1,000,000.00\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable: 903,121.89\n\nBut the \"Increase (Decrease)\" in these accounts might not represent the total current liabilities; it's the change during the period. The actual current liabilities would be the balances at the end of the period, which aren't provided here.\n\nThis is a problem because without the total current liabilities, we can't calculate the Net Cash Ratio as defined.\n\n### Re-evaluating Based on the Example\n\nGiven that the example calculates the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio, maybe the task is mislabeled, and we're actually supposed to calculate that ratio.\n\nLet's check:\n\nIn the example:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSimilarly, in the current problem:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -13,358,400.82\n- Net Profit: 1,250,911.98\n- Ratio: -13,358,400.82 / 1,250,911.98 ≈ -10.68\n\nBut the ratio is negative here, which might not make much sense in terms of interpretation, but mathematically that's the result.\n\nHowever, the task asks for the Net Cash Ratio, not the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio. \n\n### Alternative Interpretation of Net Cash Ratio\n\nAnother definition I found is that the Net Cash Ratio is the ratio of Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities to Total Assets or Net Sales, but neither is provided here.\n\nGiven the lack of current liabilities data, and the example calculating a different ratio, it's possible that the task expects the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio, even if it's labeled as Net Cash Ratio.\n\n### Proceeding with Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the example calculates this ratio, I'll proceed with:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,250,911.98} \\approx -10.68 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nGiven the information and the example provided, the most plausible calculation is the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio, even though the task asks for the Net Cash Ratio. \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '-10.68'}}\n```\n\nHowever, if the Net Cash Ratio is indeed supposed to be something else (like cash to current liabilities), we lack the necessary data to compute it accurately. \n\nGiven the example's solution format and the data we have, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '-10.68'}}\n```",
