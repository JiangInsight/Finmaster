                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities here) = 1,903,121.89\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,250,911.98\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.065\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** Net Profit / Total Revenue\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,250,911.98\n- Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = 1,250,911.98 / 18,062,437.45 ≈ 0.0692 or 6.92%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** Net Profit / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 31,154,033.87\n- Net Profit = 1,250,911.98\n\nCalculation:\nROA = 1,250,911.98 / 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.0401 or 4.01%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nFirst, we need Average Accounts Receivable. Since the initial Accounts Receivable is 0 (from the balance sheet), and the ending is 10,537,836.59, the average is:\nAverage AR = (0 + 10,537,836.59) / 2 = 5,268,918.295\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45\n\nCalculation:\nAR Turnover Ratio = 18,062,437.45 / 5,268,918.295 ≈ 3.428\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Net Profit Margin': '6.92%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '4.01%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.43'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.065 → Rounded to 0.07 seems appropriate for two decimal places.\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - 1,250,911.98 / 18,062,437.45 ≈ 0.06924 → 6.92% correct.\n\n3. **ROA:**\n   - 1,250,911.98 / 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.04015 → 4.01% correct.\n\n4. **AR Turnover Ratio:**\n   - Average AR is correct since initial is 0.\n   - 18,062,437.45 / 5,268,918.295 ≈ 3.428 → 3.43 is correct rounding.\n\nEverything checks out! The final JSON is accurate based on the provided financial statements.",
