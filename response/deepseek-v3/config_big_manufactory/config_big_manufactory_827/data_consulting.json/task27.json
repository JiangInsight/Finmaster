                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Net Cash Ratio, Current Assets Turnover Ratio, and Quick Ratio based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Net Cash Ratio**: This ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with its cash and cash equivalents. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**: This ratio shows how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}}\n   \\]\n   Where Average Current Assets is typically \\((\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}) / 2\\). However, if we only have ending current assets, we might use that.\n\n3. **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)**: This measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   Quick Assets usually include Cash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Accounts Receivable (but exclude Inventory and other less liquid current assets).\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (end of period):\n\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n  - Cash on Hand: 3,041,599.18\n  - Bank Deposits: 1,103,978.40\n  - Total Cash and Equivalents = 3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 = 4,145,577.58\n\n- **Accounts Receivable**: 10,537,836.59\n- **Inventory**: 6,100,000.00\n- **Total Current Assets**: 20,796,970.06\n- **Current Liabilities**: 1,903,121.89\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 18,062,437.45\n\nFrom the **cash flow statement**:\n\n- Beginning Cash Balance (Cash and Cash Equivalents): 20,000,000.00\n- Ending Cash Balance: 4,145,577.58\n\n### Calculating the Ratios\n\n1. **Net Cash Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{4,145,577.58}{1,903,121.89} \\approx 2.18\n   \\]\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**:\n   - If we use only ending current assets (since beginning is 20,000,000 and ending is 20,796,970.06):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{20,000,000 + 20,796,970.06}{2} = 20,398,485.03\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{18,062,437.45}{20,398,485.03} \\approx 0.89\n     \\]\n   - Alternatively, if we're supposed to use only ending current assets (as sometimes done when beginning isn't available or for simplicity):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{18,062,437.45}{20,796,970.06} \\approx 0.87\n     \\]\n   - Given the example provided seems to use ending current assets directly (0.68 was calculated as 5,431,018.59 / 7,956,806.47 ≈ 0.68), I'll proceed similarly:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{18,062,437.45}{20,796,970.06} \\approx 0.87\n     \\]\n\n3. **Quick Ratio**:\n   - Quick Assets = Cash and Equivalents + Accounts Receivable\n     = 4,145,577.58 + 10,537,836.59 = 14,683,414.17\n   - \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{14,683,414.17}{1,903,121.89} \\approx 7.72\n     \\]\n   - Wait a minute, this seems unusually high. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the example:\n     - In the example, Quick Ratio was 1.54, calculated as:\n       - Quick Assets = Cash on Hand (270,005.90) + Bank Deposits (164,645.57) + Accounts Receivable (2,429,482.13) = 2,864,133.60\n       - Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\n       - Quick Ratio = 2,864,133.60 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n     - So, similarly here:\n       - Quick Assets = Cash on Hand (3,041,599.18) + Bank Deposits (1,103,978.40) + Accounts Receivable (10,537,836.59) = 14,683,414.17\n       - Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n       - Quick Ratio = 14,683,414.17 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 7.72\n     - This seems correct based on the numbers, but it's unusually high. Maybe the company has a lot of liquid assets compared to liabilities.\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers:\n\n- **Cash and Equivalents**: 3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 = 4,145,577.58 (matches ending balance in cash flow)\n- **Accounts Receivable**: 10,537,836.59\n- **Current Liabilities**: 1,903,121.89\n\nQuick Assets = 4,145,577.58 + 10,537,836.59 = 14,683,414.17\n\nQuick Ratio = 14,683,414.17 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 7.72\n\nThis seems correct based on the data. Maybe the company has a very conservative approach with high liquidity.\n\n### Final Ratios\n\n- **Net Cash Ratio**: 2.18\n- **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**: 0.87\n- **Quick Ratio**: 7.72\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '2.18', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.87', 'Quick Ratio': '7.72'}}\n```",
