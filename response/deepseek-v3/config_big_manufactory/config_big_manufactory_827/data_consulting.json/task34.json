                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each ratio, explain what it is, and then calculate it step by step.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,903,121.89} \\approx -7.02 \\]\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity, indicating how much debt is used to finance assets relative to equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89 (since there are no non-current liabilities listed)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,250,911.98\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{1,903,121.89}{29,250,911.98} \\approx 0.065 \\]\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, it seems they might have considered only current liabilities as total liabilities if non-current are zero. So, it's approximately 0.07, but the example had 0.16, so maybe I'm missing something. But based on the data, it's ~0.065.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\nWhere Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Total Assets = 28,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 31,154,033.87\n\nAverage Total Assets:\n\\[ \\frac{28,000,000 + 31,154,033.87}{2} = \\frac{59,154,033.87}{2} = 29,577,016.935 \\]\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{18,062,437.45}{29,577,016.935} \\approx 0.61 \\]\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\nWhere Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 3,041,599.18\n- Bank Deposits = 1,103,978.40\n- Interest Receivable = 13,555.89\n- Accounts Receivable = 10,537,836.59\n- Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\nQuick Assets:\n\\[ 3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 + 13,555.89 + 10,537,836.59 = 14,696,970.06 \\]\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{14,696,970.06}{1,903,121.89} \\approx 7.72 \\]\n\nWait, this seems high compared to the example's 1.54. Maybe we shouldn't include Interest Receivable in quick assets? Typically, quick assets are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Interest receivable might not be considered liquid. So excluding it:\n\nQuick Assets:\n\\[ 3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 + 10,537,836.59 = 14,683,414.17 \\]\n\nQuick Ratio:\n\\[ \\frac{14,683,414.17}{1,903,121.89} \\approx 7.72 \\]\n\nStill high. Maybe only cash and accounts receivable? Let's check the example:\n\nIn the example, quick assets were:\nCash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable = 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,672.87 + 2,429,482.13 = 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio = 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSo in our case, including all seems correct, but the ratio is much higher. Maybe the company is very liquid.\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** Similar to the first ratio, it measures how well current liabilities are covered by operating cash flow. It's the same as the first ratio in this context.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = -7.02 \\]\n\nBut the example had the same value for both, so here it's also -7.02.\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Shareholders' Equity}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nWhere Average Shareholders' Equity = (Beginning Equity + Ending Equity) / 2\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,250,911.98\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Equity = 28,000,000.00\n- Ending Equity = 29,250,911.98\n\nAverage Equity:\n\\[ \\frac{28,000,000 + 29,250,911.98}{2} = \\frac{57,250,911.98}{2} = 28,625,455.99 \\]\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{1,250,911.98}{28,625,455.99} \\times 100\\% \\approx 4.37\\% \\]\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects receivables. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nWhere Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning AR = 0.00\n- Ending AR = 10,537,836.59\n\nAverage AR:\n\\[ \\frac{0 + 10,537,836.59}{2} = 5,268,918.295 \\]\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{18,062,437.45}{5,268,918.295} \\approx 3.43 \\]\n\nBut the example had:\nTotal Revenue = 5,431,018.59\nAverage AR = (0 + 2,429,482.13) / 2 = 1,214,741.065\nAR Turnover = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47\n\nSo our calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-7.02', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.61', 'Quick Ratio': '7.72', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-7.02', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '4.37%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.43'}}\n```\n\n**Reviewing the Debt to Equity Ratio:**\nWait, in the example, Debt to Equity was Total Current Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity, not Total Liabilities / Total Equity if non-current liabilities are zero. So it's the same here:\n1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.065, rounded to 0.07.\n\n**Quick Ratio:**\nIncluding all current assets except inventory gives us a very high quick ratio, which might be correct given the large cash and receivables compared to small liabilities.\n\n**Other Ratios:**\nAll other calculations seem correct based on the formulas and given data.\n\nSo the final answer stands as above.",
