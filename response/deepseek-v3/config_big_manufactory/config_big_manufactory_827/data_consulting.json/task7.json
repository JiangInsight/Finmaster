This is a good sanity check, as the net change in cash should equal the sum of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities (though financing activities are not provided here, the net increase aligns with the sum of operating and investing cash flows).\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The Free Cash Flow (FCF) is -15,854,422.42.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-15854422.42'} }\n```",
