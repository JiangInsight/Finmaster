                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested metrics based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFree Cash Flow is typically calculated as:\n**FCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures (CapEx)**\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -13,358,400.82\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (which is CapEx): 2,496,021.60\n\nBut looking at the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", it's already -2,496,021.60, which is just the negative of the purchase of fixed assets (since it's an outflow). \n\nHowever, in the example provided, FCF seems to be the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents, which is -15,854,422.42. This makes sense because FCF can also be seen as the net change in cash after all operating and investing activities.\n\nSo, **FCF = -15,854,422.42**\n\n### 2. Return on Assets (ROA)\nROA is calculated as:\n**ROA = Net Profit / Average Total Assets**\n\nFirst, calculate average total assets:\n- Initial Total Assets: 28,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets: 31,154,033.87\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial + End) / 2 = (28,000,000 + 31,154,033.87) / 2 = 59,154,033.87 / 2 = 29,577,016.935\n\nNet Profit: 1,250,911.98\n\nROA = 1,250,911.98 / 29,577,016.935 ≈ 0.0423 or 4.23%\n\n### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE is calculated as:\n**ROE = Net Profit / Average Shareholders' Equity**\n\nCalculate average equity:\n- Initial Equity: 28,000,000.00\n- End Equity: 29,250,911.98\n- Average Equity = (28,000,000 + 29,250,911.98) / 2 = 57,250,911.98 / 2 = 28,625,455.99\n\nNet Profit: 1,250,911.98\n\nROE = 1,250,911.98 / 28,625,455.99 ≈ 0.0437 or 4.37%\n\n### 4. Net Cash Ratio\nThe Net Cash Ratio is calculated as:\n**Net Cash Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities**\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End): 3,041,599.18\n- Bank Deposits (End): 1,103,978.40\n- Total Cash and Equivalents = 3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 = 4,145,577.58\n\nCurrent Liabilities (End): 1,903,121.89\n\nNet Cash Ratio = 4,145,577.58 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 2.18\n\n### 5. Net Profit Margin\nNet Profit Margin is calculated as:\n**Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue**\n\nNet Profit: 1,250,911.98\nTotal Revenue: 18,062,437.45\n\nNet Profit Margin = 1,250,911.98 / 18,062,437.45 ≈ 0.0693 or 6.93%\n\n### 6. Gross Profit Margin\nGross Profit Margin is calculated as:\n**Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Total Revenue**\n\nGross Profit: 4,962,437.45\nTotal Revenue: 18,062,437.45\n\nGross Profit Margin = 4,962,437.45 / 18,062,437.45 ≈ 0.2747 or 27.47%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-15854422.42', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '4.23%', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '4.37%', 'Net Cash Ratio': '2.18', 'Net Profit Margin': '6.93%', 'Gross Profit Margin': '27.47%'} }\n```",
