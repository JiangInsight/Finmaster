There are no non-current liabilities listed, so the total liabilities are equal to the total current liabilities.\n\n2. **Identify Total Assets**: From the balance sheet, the \"Total Assets\" at the end of the reporting period is 31,154,033.87.\n\n3. **Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio**: The formula for the Debt to Asset Ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,903,121.89}{31,154,033.87} \\approx 0.0611\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places, the ratio is 0.06.\n\n4. **Present the Answer**: The final answer is formatted as a JSON object with the Debt to Asset Ratio rounded to two decimal places.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06'} }\n```",
