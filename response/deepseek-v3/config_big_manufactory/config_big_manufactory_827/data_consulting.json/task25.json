                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThe Debt to Equity Ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity.  \n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89  \n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89  \n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,250,911.98\n\n**Calculation:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98  \nLet's do the division:  \n1,903,121.89 ÷ 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.065\n\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.07 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated as Total Current Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity, even though there might be non-current liabilities not listed. Given that, I'll proceed similarly here since non-current liabilities aren't provided.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**  \nNet Profit Margin shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.  \n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100\n\n**From the Income Statement:**  \n- Net Profit = 1,250,911.98  \n- Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45\n\n**Calculation:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (1,250,911.98 / 18,062,437.45) × 100  \n1,250,911.98 ÷ 18,062,437.45 ≈ 0.06925  \n0.06925 × 100 ≈ 6.925%\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately 6.93%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThis ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations.  \n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**  \n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82  \nFrom the Balance Sheet:  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\n**Calculation:**  \nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89  \n-13,358,400.82 ÷ 1,903,121.89 ≈ -7.018\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is approximately -7.02.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07', 'Net Profit Margin': '6.93%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-7.02'}}\n```\n\n**Verification with Example:**  \nIn the example provided:\n- Debt to Equity Ratio was Total Current Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity = 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16 (matches given example).\n- Net Profit Margin was (-1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59) × 100 ≈ -30.29% (matches).\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities was -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90 (matches).\n\nMy calculations follow the same method, so they should be correct.\n\n**Adjusting Debt to Equity Ratio Precision:**  \nCalculating more precisely:  \n1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 ≈ 0.06508, which rounds to 0.07.  \nAlternatively, if we consider more decimal places, it's closer to 0.065, but the example had two decimal places, so 0.07 seems appropriate.\n\nSimilarly, Net Profit Margin:  \n1,250,911.98 / 18,062,437.45 ≈ 0.06925 → 6.93% (rounding to two decimal places).\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:  \n-13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ -7.018 → -7.02.\n\nThus, the final answer is accurate based on the given data and the example's methodology.",
