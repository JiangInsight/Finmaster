                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio, Gross Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 1,903,121.89\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 31,154,033.87\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,903,121.89}{31,154,033.87} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{1,903,121.89}{31,154,033.87} \\approx 0.0611 \\]\n\nExpressed as a decimal to two places: 0.06\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have included more liabilities if any. Here, it's only current liabilities, so it's correct as is.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 4,962,437.45\n- **Total Revenue:** 18,062,437.45\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{4,962,437.45}{18,062,437.45} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{4,962,437.45}{18,062,437.45} \\approx 0.2747 \\]\n\\[ 0.2747 \\times 100 \\approx 27.47\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -13,358,400.82 (negative)\n- **Current Liabilities (from balance sheet):** 1,903,121.89\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,903,121.89} \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,903,121.89} \\approx -7.02 \\]\n\nThis is a negative ratio, indicating that the company's operating cash flow is insufficient to cover its current liabilities.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Gross Profit Margin': '27.47%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-7.02'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the ratios were formatted slightly differently (e.g., Debt to Asset Ratio was '0.14' without trailing zero, Gross Profit Margin was '18.80%' with two decimal places). Let's adjust our formatting to match:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.0611 → '0.06' (two decimal places)\n- Gross Profit Margin: 27.47% → '27.47%' (matches example format)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -7.02 → '-7.02' (matches example format)\n\nSo, the final answer is correct as above.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me double-check the calculations quickly:\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 1,903,121.89\n   - Assets: 31,154,033.87\n   - 1,903,121.89 / 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.0611 → '0.06'\n\n2. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: 4,962,437.45\n   - Revenue: 18,062,437.45\n   - (4,962,437.45 / 18,062,437.45) * 100 ≈ 27.47 → '27.47%'\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -13,358,400.82\n   - Current Liabilities: 1,903,121.89\n   - -13,358,400.82 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ -7.02 → '-7.02'\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Gross Profit Margin': '27.47%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-7.02'}}\n```",
