                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each required ratio one by one, using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 20,796,970.06\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\n**Calculation:**\n20,796,970.06 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 10.93\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 4,962,437.45\n- Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45\n\n**Calculation:**\n(4,962,437.45 / 18,062,437.45) * 100 ≈ 27.47%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 1,903,121.89\n- Total Assets = 31,154,033.87\n\n**Calculation:**\n1,903,121.89 / 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.061 or 6.1%\n\nWait a minute, the example had a Debt to Asset Ratio calculated differently. It seems they might have considered only current liabilities, but typically, it's total liabilities over total assets. Here, since only current liabilities are present, it's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that \"Debt\" is just the current liabilities (as no other debts are listed), then it's indeed 1,903,121.89 / 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.061 or 6.1%.\n\nBut looking back at the example, their Debt to Asset was Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets = 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14. So, following that approach:\n\nHere: 1,903,121.89 / 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.061 or 6.1%\n\nHmm, the example's calculation seems to be Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets, not Total Liabilities / Total Assets. Maybe the term \"Debt\" here is being used to mean current liabilities. So, following that:\n\n1,903,121.89 / 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.061 or 6.1%\n\nBut the example had 0.14, which is higher because their current liabilities were a larger portion of total assets. Maybe the correct interpretation is indeed current liabilities over total assets.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1,250,911.98\n- Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45\n\n**Calculation:**\n(1,250,911.98 / 18,062,437.45) * 100 ≈ 6.93%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 3,041,599.18\n- Bank Deposits = 1,103,978.40\n- Total Cash and Equivalents = 3,041,599.18 + 1,103,978.40 = 4,145,577.58\n- Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\n**Calculation:**\n4,145,577.58 / 1,903,121.89 ≈ 2.18\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -2,496,021.60\n- FCF is typically calculated as Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures (which is part of Investing Activities). Here, Purchase of Fixed Assets is 2,496,021.60, so:\n\nFCF = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures\n= -13,358,400.82 - 2,496,021.60 = -15,854,422.42\n\nAlternatively, the cash flow statement shows \"Net Increase\" in cash as -15,854,422.42, which matches the sum of operating and investing cash flows (since no financing activities are listed). So, FCF could be considered as the net change in cash, which is -15,854,422.42.\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Profit = 1,250,911.98\n- Total Assets = 31,154,033.87\n\n**Calculation:**\n(1,250,911.98 / 31,154,033.87) * 100 ≈ 4.02%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '10.93', 'Gross Profit Margin': '27.47%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '6.11%', 'Net Profit Margin': '6.93%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '2.18', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-15854422.42', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '4.02%'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the Debt to Asset Ratio. If it's Total Liabilities / Total Assets, and Total Liabilities here is only Current Liabilities (1,903,121.89), then:\n1,903,121.89 / 31,154,033.87 ≈ 0.0611 or 6.11%. \n\nThe example had Current Liabilities / Total Assets as Debt to Asset, so this seems correct.\n\nAll other calculations seem correct based on the formulas and data provided.\n\n**Final Json:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '10.93', 'Gross Profit Margin': '27.47%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '6.11%', 'Net Profit Margin': '6.93%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '2.18', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-15854422.42', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '4.02%'} }\n```",
