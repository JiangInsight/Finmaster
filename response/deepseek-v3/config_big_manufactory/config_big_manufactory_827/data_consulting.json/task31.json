                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from in the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all sales are credit sales) = Main Business Revenue = 18,062,437.45\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (from initial amount on 2023-12-31)\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 10,537,836.59\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**\n\\[ \\text{Average AR} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning AR} + \\text{Ending AR}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 10,537,836.59}{2} = 5,268,918.295 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{AR Turnover} = \\frac{18,062,437.45}{5,268,918.295} \\approx 3.43 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio was calculated as 4.47 with similar data. Maybe they used Ending Accounts Receivable instead of Average? Let me check:\n\nIf we use only Ending AR:\n\\[ \\frac{18,062,437.45}{10,537,836.59} \\approx 1.71 \\]\nThat's lower than the example. Maybe the example used Average, and I did it right. Maybe the example had higher sales relative to AR. I think 3.43 is correct here.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Operating Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82\n- Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,903,121.89} \\approx -7.02 \\]\n\n*Hmm*, in the example, it was -3.90. Maybe I'm missing something. Is Operating Cash Flow supposed to be positive? Wait, no, it's given as negative here. Maybe the example had a smaller negative cash flow relative to liabilities. So -7.02 seems correct for this data.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems identical to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided (both were -3.90 in the example). So:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = -7.02 \\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales = Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45\n- Beginning Total Assets = 28,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 31,154,033.87\n\n**Average Total Assets:**\n\\[ \\text{Average TA} = \\frac{28,000,000 + 31,154,033.87}{2} = \\frac{59,154,033.87}{2} = 29,577,016.935 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover} = \\frac{18,062,437.45}{29,577,016.935} \\approx 0.61 \\]\n\nIn the example, it was 0.41, which is lower, but here sales are higher relative to assets, so 0.61 seems correct.\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89 (since no non-current liabilities are listed)\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = 29,250,911.98\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity} = \\frac{1,903,121.89}{29,250,911.98} \\approx 0.065 \\]\n\nIn the example, it was 0.16. Here, liabilities are much smaller relative to equity, so 0.065 seems correct.\n\n*Wait*, looking back at the balance sheet, Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity is 31,154,033.87, and Owner's Equity is 29,250,911.98, so Liabilities = Total - Equity = 31,154,033.87 - 29,250,911.98 = 1,903,121.89, which matches Current Liabilities. So no other liabilities. So 0.065 is correct.\n\nBut the example had Debt to Equity as 0.16, which is higher. Maybe they included more liabilities. Here, it's just current liabilities, so 0.065 is accurate.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter carefully calculating each ratio, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.43', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-7.02', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-7.02', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.61', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.065'}}\n```\n\n*However*, looking back at the example, the Debt to Equity was 0.16, and here it's much lower. Maybe I missed something. Let me recheck Debt to Equity:\n\nTotal Liabilities = Current Liabilities = 1,903,121.89\nTotal Equity = 29,250,911.98\nDebt to Equity = 1,903,121.89 / 29,250,911.98 â‰ˆ 0.065\n\nSeems correct. Maybe the example had more debt. So I'll stick with 0.065.\n\nSimilarly, Operating Cash Flow ratios are negative because cash flow from operations is negative, which is correct.\n\nTotal Asset Turnover is higher here because sales are higher relative to assets compared to the example.\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover is lower than the example because AR is higher relative to sales here.\n\nSo final answer is as above.",
