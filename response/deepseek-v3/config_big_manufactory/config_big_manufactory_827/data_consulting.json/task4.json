In the given problem, the \"Total Current Liabilities\" is provided as 1,903,121.89. There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so the total liabilities are 1,903,121.89.\n\n2. **Identify Total Owner's Equity**: This is the sum of the owner's equity on the balance sheet. In the given problem, the \"Total Owner's Equity\" is provided as 29,250,911.98.\n\n3. **Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio**: The formula for the Debt to Equity Ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,903,121.89}{29,250,911.98} \\approx 0.065\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places, the ratio is 0.07.\n\nHere is the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.07'} }\n```",
