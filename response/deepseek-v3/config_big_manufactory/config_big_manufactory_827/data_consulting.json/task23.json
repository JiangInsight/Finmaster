                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**\nGross Profit Margin is a profitability ratio that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue (Main Business Revenue) = \\$18,062,437.45\n- Gross Profit = \\$4,962,437.45\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{4,962,437.45}{18,062,437.45} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{4,962,437.45}{18,062,437.45} \\approx 0.2747 \\]\n\\[ 0.2747 \\times 100 \\approx 27.47\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **27.47%**.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -\\$13,358,400.82 (negative value)\n\n**Determining Total Debt:**\nFrom the Balance Sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" we see:\n- Total Current Liabilities = \\$1,903,121.89\n\nAssuming that \"Total Current Liabilities\" represents the total debt (since no long-term liabilities are provided), we'll use this as the total debt.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,903,121.89} \\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\\[ \\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,903,121.89} \\approx -7.018 \\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-7.02**.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was calculated using \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" over \"Total Current Liabilities,\" which seems consistent with our approach here. \n\nBut let's double-check if \"Total Debt\" should include any other liabilities. In the given balance sheet, only \"Total Current Liabilities\" are present, and there are no long-term liabilities listed. Therefore, it's appropriate to use \"Total Current Liabilities\" as the total debt in this context.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '27.47%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-7.02'} }\n```\n\n**Verification with Example:**\nIn the example provided:\n- Gross Profit Margin was calculated as (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100 = (1,021,018.59 / 5,431,018.59) * 100 ≈ 18.80%\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities = -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90\n\nOur calculations follow the same methodology, so our approach seems correct.\n\n### Potential Considerations:\n1. **Total Debt Definition:** If there were long-term liabilities, they should be added to current liabilities to get total debt. Here, only current liabilities are present.\n2. **Negative Cash Flow:** A negative Cash Flow to Debt Ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, meaning it's not generating enough cash from operations to cover its current liabilities, which is a concern.\n3. **Gross Profit Margin:** A 27.47% margin suggests that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about 27 cents after accounting for the cost of goods sold, which is a healthy margin.\n\n### Final Confirmation:\nAfter carefully going through the calculations and verifying with the provided example, the final ratios are correctly computed as:\n\n- Gross Profit Margin: 27.47%\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -7.02\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '27.47%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-7.02'} }\n```",
