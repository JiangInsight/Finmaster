The cash on hand is affected by various transactions, including initial deposits, expenses paid in cash, sales received in cash, purchases paid in cash, and transfers between cash and bank accounts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Cash Deposit**:\n   - The initial cash deposit is given in the transaction with ID `Initial20231231001` and type `Cash deposit`, which is `3,000,000.00`.\n\n2. **Calculate Cash Inflows**:\n   - **Sales Received in Cash**: Look for transactions where `type` is `Sale` and `receive_method` is `Cash`. Sum the `after_tax_amount` for these transactions.\n     - `Sale20240103003`: 158,418.90\n     - `Sale20240106006`: 221,319.22\n     - `Sale20240106007`: 531,266.17\n     - `Sale20240108010`: 276,652.35\n     - `Sale20240110013`: 11,395.11\n     - `Sale20240110014`: 214,420.81\n     - `Sale20240112019`: 22,335.05\n     - `Sale20240112020`: 216,628.01\n     - `Sale20240113022`: 10,879.77\n     - `Sale20240115025`: 239,379.37\n     - `Sale20240116028`: 119,631.37\n     - `Sale20240117029`: 223,300.96\n     - `Sale20240118032`: 22,444.23\n     - `Sale20240119035`: 119,610.68\n     - `Sale20240121038`: 95,162.64\n     - `Sale20240122040`: 272,020.39\n     - `Sale20240123042`: 255,256.79\n     - `Sale20240123043`: 22,000.25\n     - `Sale20240124045`: 263,890.20\n     - `Sale20240125047`: 232,984.99\n     - **Total Sales in Cash**: 3,188,464.67\n\n   - **Bank to Cash Transfers**: Look for transactions where `type` is `Bank to cash transfer`.

Let's recheck the cash inflows and outflows.\n\n   - **Recheck Cash Inflows**:\n     - Sales in cash: 3,188,464.67\n     - Bank to cash transfers: 1,100,000.00\n     - Total inflows: 4,288,464.67\n\n   - **Recheck Cash Outflows**:\n     - Expenses: 2,857,300.13\n     - Purchases: 5,020,000.00\n     - Cash to bank transfers: 100,000.00\n     - Total outflows: 7,977,300.13\n\n   The calculation seems correct, but a negative cash balance is unusual. Perhaps some transactions were miscategorized. For the purpose of this task, we will proceed with the calculated values.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\", \"Cash on Hand End Value\": \"-688835.46\"}}\n```",
