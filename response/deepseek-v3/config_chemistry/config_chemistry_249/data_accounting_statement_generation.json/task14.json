Current liabilities typically include obligations that are due within one year, such as accounts payable, short-term loans, and other short-term debts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Current Liabilities:**\n   - The initial current liabilities are the unpaid amounts from the initial transactions. From the given data, there are no unpaid transactions at the start (2023-12-31). Therefore, the initial current liabilities are `0.00`.\n\n2. **Identify Final Current Liabilities:**\n   - The final current liabilities are the unpaid amounts at the end of the period. We need to look for transactions with `payment/receipt_status` as \"Unpaid\" and `type` as \"Purchase\" (since these represent accounts payable).\n   - From the data, the following purchases are unpaid:\n     - `Purchase20231231005`: Amount = 460,000.0 (Unpaid)\n     - `Purchase20231231008`: Amount = 800,000.0 (Unpaid)\n   - Additionally, we need to include any unpaid interest receivables, but these are assets, not liabilities, so they are not included in current liabilities.\n   - Total unpaid purchases (accounts payable) = 460,000.0 + 800,000.0 = 1,260,000.0.\n\n3. **Verify Other Potential Current Liabilities:**\n   - There are no other transactions indicating short-term loans or other current liabilities in the data. Therefore, the total current liabilities at the end are the sum of unpaid purchases.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Initial Current Liabilities: 0.00\n   - Final Current Liabilities: 1,260,000.00\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '1260000.00'} }\n```",
