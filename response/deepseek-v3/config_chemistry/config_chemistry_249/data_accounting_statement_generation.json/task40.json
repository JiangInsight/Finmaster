Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Purchase Transactions\nWe look for all transactions where the type is \"Purchase\" (initial inventory additions). These represent increases in inventory.\n\nFrom the data:\n1. Purchase20231231001: 340,000.0 (17 units of P002 at 20,000 per unit)\n2. Purchase20231231002: 1,900,000.0 (19 units of P004 at 100,000 per unit)\n3. Purchase20231231003: 600,000.0 (12 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit)\n4. Purchase20231231004: 260,000.0 (26 units of P001 at 10,000 per unit)\n5. Purchase20231231005: 460,000.0 (23 units of P002 at 20,000 per unit) - Unpaid (but still part of inventory)\n6. Purchase20231231006: 450,000.0 (9 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit)\n7. Purchase20231231007: 850,000.0 (17 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit)\n8. Purchase20231231008: 800,000.0 (16 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit) - Unpaid (but still part of inventory)\n9. Purchase20231231009: 800,000.0 (8 units of P004 at 100,000 per unit)\n10. Purchase20231231010: 1,500,000.0 (15 units of P004 at 100,000 per unit)\n11. Purchase20231231011: 1,100,000.0 (22 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit)\n12. Purchase20231231012: 60,000.0 (6 units of P001 at 10,000 per unit)\n\nTotal Purchases = Sum of all above = 340,000 + 1,900,000 + 600,000 + 260,000 + 460,000 + 450,000 + 850,000 + 800,000 + 800,000 + 1,500,000 + 1,100,000 + 60,000 = 8,220,000.0\n\n### Step 2: Identify Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nWe look for all \"Sale\" transactions and sum their \"cost_amount\" (quantity sold * cost per unit). These represent decreases in inventory.\n\nFrom the data:\n1. Sale20240103003: 150,000.0 (3 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit)\n2. Sale20240104004: 250,000.0 (5 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit)\n3. Sale20240105005: 40,000.0 (2 units of P002 at 20,000 per unit)\n4. Sale20240106006: 200,000.0 (4 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit)\n5. Sale20240106007: 500,000.0 (5 units of P004 at 100,000 per unit)\n6. Sale20240107009: 200,000.0 (4 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit)\n7. Sale20240108010: 250,000.0 (5 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit)\n8. Sale20240108011: 100,000.0 (2 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit)\n9. Sale20240109012: 500,000.0 (5 units of P004 at 100,000 per unit)\n10. Sale20240110013: 10,000.0 (1 unit of P001 at 10,000 per unit)\n11.

Sale20240131057: 100,000.0 (2 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit)\n\nTotal COGS = Sum of all above = 5,960,000.0\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Net Change in Inventory\nNet Change = Total Purchases - Total COGS = 8,220,000 - 5,960,000 = 2,260,000.0\n\nSince inventory increased (purchases > COGS), this is represented as a negative value in the cash flow statement (cash outflow).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": \"-2260000.00\"}}\n```",
