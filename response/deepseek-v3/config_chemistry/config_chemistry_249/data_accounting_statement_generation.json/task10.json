                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the initial and final values of property, plant, and non-current assets in the balance sheet based on the provided transactions data. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Non-current Assets\nFrom the transactions data, the initial non-current assets are recorded under the \"Fixed Assets\" type with the ID \"Initial20231231001\". The initial amount is:\n- **Initial Fixed Assets**: 5,000,000.00\n\n### Step 2: Identify Additional Fixed Assets Purchases\nWe need to look for transactions where fixed assets are purchased. These are recorded under the \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" type. From the data:\n- **FixedAsset20231231001**: 362,437.67 (Storage Facilities4)\n- **FixedAsset20231231001**: 303,640.51 (Processing Equipment5)\n\nTotal additional fixed assets purchased: 362,437.67 + 303,640.51 = 666,078.18\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Initial Non-current Assets\nThe total initial non-current assets are the sum of the initial fixed assets and any additional fixed assets purchased at the beginning (if any). In this case, the initial fixed assets are already given as 5,000,000.00, and there are no additional initial purchases beyond this. \n\nHowever, the additional fixed assets purchases are part of the non-current assets, so the initial value is just the initial fixed assets:\n- **Total Non-current Assets Initial Value**: 5,000,000.00\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Depreciation\nDepreciation reduces the value of non-current assets over time. From the data:\n- **Depreciation20240101001**: 45,748.20\n- **Depreciation20240201002**: 54,491.69\n\nTotal depreciation: 45,748.20 + 54,491.69 = 100,239.89\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Total Non-current Assets End Value\nThe end value is calculated as:\n- Initial Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n- Add: Additional Fixed Assets Purchased: 666,078.18\n- Subtract: Total Depreciation: 100,239.89\n\nTotal Non-current Assets End Value = 5,000,000.00 + 666,078.18 - 100,239.89 = 5,565,838.29\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5565838.29'} }\n```",
