Liabilities typically include accounts payable and any other unpaid obligations. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Liabilities:**\n   - The initial liabilities are the amounts that are unpaid at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31). \n   - From the transactions, we look for entries where `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" and the `date` is \"2023-12-31\".\n   - The only initial liability is from the transaction with id `Purchase20231231005` where the amount is `460000.0` and the payment method is \"Account Payable\".\n\n2. **Identify Final Liabilities:**\n   - The final liabilities include all unpaid amounts at the end of the period. \n   - We look for transactions where `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" and the `date` is after \"2023-12-31\".\n   - The unpaid purchases are:\n     - `Purchase20231231008`: `800000.0` (Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231005`: `460000.0` (Account Payable, already included in initial liabilities)\n   - Additionally, there are unpaid interest receivables (e.g., `Interest20240101001`, `Interest20240102002`, etc.), but these are assets, not liabilities, so they should not be included in liabilities.\n   - There are also unpaid sales (e.g., `Sale20240104004`, `Sale20240105005`, etc.), but these are accounts receivable (assets), not liabilities.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Liabilities:**\n   - Initial Liabilities: `460000.0` (from `Purchase20231231005`)\n   - Final Liabilities: `460000.0` (from `Purchase20231231005`) + `800000.0` (from `Purchase20231231008`) = `1260000.0`\n\n4. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The initial and final liabilities are formatted to two decimal places as strings.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Total Liabilities Initial Value\": \"460000.00\", \"Total Liabilities End Value\": \"1260000.00\"}}\n```",
