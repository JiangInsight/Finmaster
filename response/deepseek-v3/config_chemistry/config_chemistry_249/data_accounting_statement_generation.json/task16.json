Paid-in capital represents the amount of money that shareholders have invested in the company in exchange for shares of stock. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Transactions:**\n   - The initial transactions are marked with \"Initial\" in the `id` field. These transactions represent the initial capital injected into the company.\n   - From the given data, the initial transactions are:\n     - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n     - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n     - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n\n2. **Calculate Initial Paid-in Capital:**\n   - The initial paid-in capital is the sum of the cash deposit and bank deposit, as these represent the initial investments by shareholders.\n   - Fixed assets are not part of paid-in capital; they are assets purchased using the capital.\n   - Therefore, initial paid-in capital = Cash deposit + Bank deposit = 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 8,000,000.0.\n\n3. **Determine Final Paid-in Capital:**\n   - Paid-in capital typically does not change unless there are additional investments or withdrawals by shareholders. In the given transactions, there are no additional investments or withdrawals that would affect the paid-in capital.\n   - Therefore, the final paid-in capital remains the same as the initial paid-in capital: 8,000,000.0.\n\n4. **Format the Solution:**\n   - The solution should be presented in the specified JSON format with the initial and final paid-in capital values.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '8000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
