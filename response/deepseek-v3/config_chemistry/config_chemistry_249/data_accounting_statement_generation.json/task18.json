                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the total owner's equity for both the initial and final amounts based on the provided transactions data. Owner's equity is calculated as the sum of all assets minus the sum of all liabilities. However, since the problem focuses on the owner's equity directly, we can infer it from the initial investments and the changes due to profits and expenses.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Initial Owner's Equity\nThe initial owner's equity is the sum of the initial deposits and fixed assets:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n\nTotal Initial Owner's Equity = 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 13,000,000.0\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Net Profit or Loss\nNet profit or loss is calculated by summing all profits from sales and subtracting all expenses, depreciation, and interest expenses.\n\n#### Profits from Sales:\nFrom the \"Sale\" transactions, the profit is given in the \"profit\" column. Summing all these:\n- Sale20240103003: 16,756.74\n- Sale20240104004: 99,296.60\n- Sale20240105005: 4,250.22\n- Sale20240106006: 32,967.60\n- Sale20240106007: 59,227.55\n- Sale20240107009: 27,163.12\n-
