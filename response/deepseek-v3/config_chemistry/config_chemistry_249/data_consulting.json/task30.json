                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 7,000,260.27\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 1,601,835.08\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 7,000,260.27 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 4.37\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 376,598.62\n- Bank Deposits = 100,482.62\n- Interest Receivable = 5,155.34\n- Accounts Receivable = 3,098,023.69\n- Total Quick Assets = 376,598.62 + 100,482.62 + 5,155.34 + 3,098,023.69 = 3,580,260.27\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 3,580,260.27 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 2.24\n\n*Wait a minute*, usually the Quick Ratio excludes inventory and sometimes other less liquid current assets. Here, I've included Cash, Bank Deposits (which are like cash equivalents), Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable. Inventory is typically excluded because it's less liquid. \n\nBut looking at the initial example's Quick Ratio calculation, it seems they might have only included Cash, Bank Deposits, and Accounts Receivable, excluding Interest Receivable. Let me check:\n\nIf we exclude Interest Receivable:\nQuick Assets = 376,598.62 + 100,482.62 + 3,098,023.69 = 3,575,104.93\nQuick Ratio = 3,575,104.93 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 2.23\n\nHmm, the initial example had a Quick Ratio of 1.54, which is lower. Maybe they only included Cash and Bank Deposits as quick assets? But that seems too restrictive. Alternatively, maybe they didn't include Interest Receivable and only Cash, Bank, and Accounts Receivable.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with including Cash, Bank, and Accounts Receivable:\nQuick Ratio ≈ 2.23\n\nBut to match the initial example's approach more closely, perhaps Interest Receivable is included. Maybe the difference is due to other items. For now, I'll proceed with ≈ 2.23 unless corrected.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 1,601,835.08\n- Total Assets = 12,566,098.56\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 12,566,098.56 ≈ 0.127 or 0.13\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n- Total Owner's Equity = 10,964,263.48\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48 ≈ 0.146 or 0.15\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,856,840.58\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ -4.28\n\n*Note:* A negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, which isn't favorable.\n\n### Verifying Against Initial Example\nLooking back at the initial example to ensure consistency in calculations:\n- Their Current Ratio was Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities = 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.27 (matches)\n- Quick Ratio: They had 1.54, which seems lower than what I got. Maybe they didn't include Interest Receivable and possibly some other items. Maybe only Cash + Bank + Accounts Receivable: 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,429,482.13 = 2,864,133.60 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54. So in our case, it would be (376,598.62 + 100,482.62 + 3,098,023.69) / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 3,575,104.93 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 2.23. Maybe the initial example had a different composition. I'll stick with 2.23 unless there's a strict definition excluding certain items.\n- Debt to Asset: Theirs was 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14 (close to our 0.13)\n- Debt to Equity: Theirs was 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16 (close to our 0.15)\n- Cash Flow to Debt: Theirs was -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90 (ours is -4.28)\n\nGiven that, our calculations seem consistent in method, with minor differences possibly due to rounding or slight definition variations.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios based on the provided financial statements, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '4.37', 'Quick Ratio': '2.23', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-4.28'}}\n```\n\n*Note on Quick Ratio:* If we strictly follow the initial example's approach where Quick Ratio seems to be (Cash + Bank + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities, then it's 2.23. If Interest Receivable is included, it's slightly higher. The exact definition can vary, but 2.23 seems appropriate based on common practices and the given data.",
