                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed):** 1,601,835.08\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 10,964,263.48\n\nWait a minute, in the balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" it's listed as 1,601,835.08, and there are no other liabilities mentioned like long-term debts. So, total liabilities = total current liabilities = 1,601,835.08.\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,601,835.08}{10,964,263.48} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n1,601,835.08 ÷ 10,964,263.48 ≈ 0.1461\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.15\n\nBut in the example provided, it was rounded to two decimal places as well, so we'll do the same here.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** -2,035,736.52\n- **Total Revenue:** 6,836,701.10\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-2,035,736.52}{6,836,701.10} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\n-2,035,736.52 ÷ 6,836,701.10 ≈ -0.2978\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n\n-0.2978 × 100 ≈ -29.78%\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -29.78%\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -6,856,840.58\n- **Total Current Liabilities (from balance sheet):** 1,601,835.08\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{1,601,835.08} \\]\n\nDivide:\n\n-6,856,840.58 ÷ 1,601,835.08 ≈ -4.2806\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -4.28\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.15\n- Net Profit Margin: -29.78%\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -4.28\n\nIn the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Net Profit Margin': '-29.78%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-4.28'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 1,601,835.08\n   - Equity: 10,964,263.48\n   - 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48 ≈ 0.146 → 0.15 (correct)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: -2,035,736.52\n   - Revenue: 6,836,701.10\n   - -2,035,736.52 / 6,836,701.10 ≈ -0.2978 → -29.78% (correct)\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -6,856,840.58\n   - Current Liabilities: 1,601,835.08\n   - -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ -4.28 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Net Profit Margin': '-29.78%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-4.28'} }\n```",
