                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand how to compute both the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Ratios\n\n**a. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nThis ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nA higher ratio indicates more leverage and higher financial risk.\n\n**b. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operations to the net income, indicating how much cash the company generates relative to its reported profits. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\nA ratio greater than 1 suggests that the company is generating more cash than its net income, which is generally positive.\n\n### 2. Extracting the Necessary Data from the Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each financial statement to find the numbers we need.\n\n**a. Balance Sheet:**\nWe need:\n- Total Liabilities\n- Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet provided:\n- Under \"Total Current Liabilities\": 1,601,835.08\n- There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so \"Total Liabilities\" = \"Total Current Liabilities\" = 1,601,835.08\n- \"Total Assets\" = 12,566,098.56\n\n**b. Cash Flow Statement:**\nWe need:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- Net Income (which is also found in the income statement)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" = -6,856,840.58\n- \"Net Profit\" (which is Net Income) = -2,035,736.52\n\n**c. Income Statement:**\nWe can confirm the Net Income here:\n- \"Net Profit\" = -2,035,736.52 (matches the cash flow statement)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratios\n\n**a. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = 1,601,835.08 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Assets} = 12,566,098.56 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,601,835.08}{12,566,098.56} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,601,835.08}{12,566,098.56} \\approx 0.127 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.13\n\n**b. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} = -6,856,840.58 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Net Income} = -2,035,736.52 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{-2,035,736.52} \\]\n\nThe negatives cancel out:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6,856,840.58}{2,035,736.52} \\approx 3.368 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 3.37\n\n### 4. Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n- Total Liabilities: Only current liabilities are present at 1,601,835.08.\n- Total Assets: 12,566,098.56.\n- 1,601,835.08 / 12,566,098.56 ≈ 0.127 → 0.13 when rounded.\n\n**Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**\n- Operating Cash Flow: -6,856,840.58\n- Net Income: -2,035,736.52\n- Ratio: 6,856,840.58 / 2,035,736.52 ≈ 3.368 → 3.37\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.37'} }\n```\n\n### 6. Additional Observations\n\n- **Debt to Asset Ratio (0.13):** This indicates that about 13% of the company's assets are financed by debt, which is relatively low. The company is not highly leveraged.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio (3.37):** This ratio is significantly higher than 1, which might seem positive at first glance. However, both the operating cash flow and net income are negative, which is concerning. The high ratio suggests that the company's cash outflow from operations is much larger than its net loss, indicating substantial cash burn relative to the reported loss. This could be a sign of significant investments in working capital (like increases in accounts receivable and inventory) that are consuming cash despite the operational loss.\n\nIn summary, while the company isn't heavily indebted, its operations are generating substantial cash outflows compared to its net loss, which could be a red flag regarding its operational efficiency or growth investments.",
