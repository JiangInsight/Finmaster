                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step to ensure I understand how each is derived from the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all revenue is credit sales) = Main Business Revenue = \\$6,836,701.10\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = \\$0.00 (from initial balance sheet)\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = \\$3,098,023.69\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**\n\\[ \\text{Average AR} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning AR} + \\text{Ending AR}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 3,098,023.69}{2} = \\$1,549,011.845 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{AR Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{6,836,701.10}{1,549,011.845} \\approx 4.41 \\]\n\n*Note: Since beginning AR is zero, the average is half of the ending AR. This might not be perfectly accurate if the company started with zero AR and all sales were made within the period, but it's the best we can do with the given data.*\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -\\$6,856,840.58\n- Current Liabilities = \\$1,601,835.08\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{1,601,835.08} \\approx -4.28 \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems identical to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided (both had the same value). Assuming it's the same:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = -4.28 \\]\n\n*If there's a distinction, it might involve averaging current liabilities or other adjustments, but given the data, we'll proceed similarly.*\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Net Sales = Total Revenue = \\$6,836,701.10\n- Beginning Total Assets = \\$13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = \\$12,566,098.56\n\n**Average Total Assets:**\n\\[ \\text{Average TA} = \\frac{13,000,000 + 12,566,098.56}{2} = \\frac{25,566,098.56}{2} = \\$12,783,049.28 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{6,836,701.10}{12,783,049.28} \\approx 0.535 \\]\n\n*Rounding to two decimal places: 0.54*\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = \\$1,601,835.08\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = \\$10,964,263.48\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,601,835.08}{10,964,263.48} \\approx 0.146 \\]\n\n*Rounding to two decimal places: 0.15*\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.41', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-4.28', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-4.28', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.54', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15'}}\n```\n\n**Verification with Example:**\nLooking back at the example provided, the ratios were calculated similarly, especially noting that operating cash flow ratio and operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio were the same. The slight differences in our calculations are due to rounding and the specific numbers in the problem.\n\n- AR Turnover: Example had 4.47, ours is 4.41 (due to higher sales and similar AR in the example)\n- Operating ratios: Both negative, magnitude depends on cash flow and liabilities\n- Total Asset Turnover: Example was 0.41, ours is 0.54 (higher sales relative to assets in our case)\n- Debt to Equity: Example was 0.16, ours is 0.15 (similar scale)\n\nEverything checks out methodologically!",
