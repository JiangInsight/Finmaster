                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. \n\n### 1. Understanding the Ratios\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\nThis measures how effectively a company uses its shareholders' equity to generate profit. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n*Note:* Sometimes, the ending shareholder's equity is used if beginning figures aren't available or if the period is short.\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nThis shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\nThis indicates the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). The formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\n### 2. Extracting Necessary Data from the Statements\n\nLet's pull out the numbers we need from each statement.\n\n**From the Balance Sheet (End of Period - 2024-02-01):**\n- Total Assets: 12,566,098.56\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,601,835.08\n  *Assuming no long-term liabilities are given, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities.*\n- Total Owner's Equity: 10,964,263.48\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Net Profit: -2,035,736.52\n- Total Revenue: 6,836,701.10\n- Gross Profit: 1,136,701.10\n\n### 3. Calculating Each Ratio\n\n**a. Return on Equity (ROE):**\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{-2,035,736.52}{10,964,263.48} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{ROE} \\approx -18.57\\% \\]\n\n*Interpretation:* A negative ROE indicates that the company is not generating profit from its equity; instead, it's losing money.\n\n**b. Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,601,835.08}{12,566,098.56} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} \\approx 0.1275 \\text{ or } 12.75\\% \\]\n\n*Interpretation:* About 12.75% of the company's assets are financed by debt. This is a relatively low ratio, indicating less reliance on debt.\n\n**c. Gross Profit Margin:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{1,136,701.10}{6,836,701.10} \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} \\approx 16.63\\% \\]\n\n*Interpretation:* For every dollar of revenue, the company retains about $0.1663 after accounting for the cost of goods sold.\n\n### 4. Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n**ROE:**\n- -2,035,736.52 / 10,964,263.48 ≈ -0.1857 → -18.57% ✔\n\n**Debt to Asset:**\n- 1,601,835.08 / 12,566,098.56 ≈ 0.1275 ✔\n\n**Gross Profit Margin:**\n- 1,136,701.10 / 6,836,701.10 ≈ 0.1663 → 16.63% ✔\n\nAll calculations seem correct.\n\n### 5. Final Answer\n\nCompiling the results into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-18.57%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Gross Profit Margin': '16.63%'} }\n```\n\n*Note:* The Debt to Asset Ratio is rounded to two decimal places as per common practice.\n\n### 6. Additional Observations\n\n- The company is currently operating at a loss, as indicated by the negative ROE.\n- The debt level is relatively low, which might be good in terms of financial stability but could also indicate underutilization of leverage.\n- The gross profit margin is around 16.63%, which means the company retains a reasonable portion of revenue after COGS, but operating expenses are leading to net losses.\n\nThis analysis provides a snapshot of the company's financial health based on the given data. Further investigation into operating expenses and potential revenue growth strategies might be warranted to improve profitability.",
