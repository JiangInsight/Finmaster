                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the required ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 7,000,260.27\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 1,601,835.08\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 7,000,260.27 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 4.37\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 1,136,701.10\n- Total Revenue = 6,836,701.10\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (1,136,701.10 / 6,836,701.10) * 100 ≈ 16.63%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no non-current liabilities are listed) = 1,601,835.08\n- Total Assets = 12,566,098.56\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 12,566,098.56 ≈ 0.127 or 12.7%\n\nBut looking at the example, it seems they might have considered Total Liabilities as just Current Liabilities (since non-current liabilities aren't provided), so I'll stick with that.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -2,035,736.52\n- Total Revenue = 6,836,701.10\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (-2,035,736.52 / 6,836,701.10) * 100 ≈ -29.78%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 376,598.62\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 100,482.62\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 376,598.62 + 100,482.62 = 477,081.24\n- Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 477,081.24 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 0.298 or 0.30\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,856,840.58\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -666,078.18\n- Free Cash Flow = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -6,856,840.58 + (-666,078.18) = -7,522,918.76\n\nAlternatively, the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents is -7,522,918.76, which matches this.\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -2,035,736.52\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 12,566,098.56\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (-2,035,736.52 / 12,566,098.56) * 100 ≈ -16.20%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '4.37', 'Gross Profit Margin': '16.63%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Net Profit Margin': '-29.78%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '0.30', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-7522918.76', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-16.20%'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nComparing with the example, the calculations seem consistent in methodology. The slight differences in decimal places are due to rounding. All formulas have been applied correctly based on the provided data.\n\n**Note on Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nIn the example, it was calculated as Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets, which gave 0.14. Here, it's 1,601,835.08 / 12,566,098.56 ≈ 0.127, rounded to 0.13. If non-current liabilities were present, they'd be included, but since they're not, this seems correct.",
