                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. I'll go through each one, explaining how to calculate them using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Liabilities:** This is the \"Total Current Liabilities\" because there are no non-current liabilities listed. So, Total Liabilities = 1,601,835.08.\n- **Total Assets:** 12,566,098.56.\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1,601,835.08}{12,566,098.56} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{1,601,835.08}{12,566,098.56} \\approx 0.1275 \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.13.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 1,136,701.10\n- **Total Revenue:** 6,836,701.10\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,136,701.10}{6,836,701.10} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{1,136,701.10}{6,836,701.10} \\approx 0.1663 \\]\n\\[ 0.1663 \\times 100 \\approx 16.63\\% \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: 16.63%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -6,856,840.58 (negative value)\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 1,601,835.08 (from the balance sheet)\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{1,601,835.08} \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{1,601,835.08} \\approx -4.28 \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: -4.28.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Gross Profit Margin': '16.63%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-4.28'}}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - Total Liabilities: 1,601,835.08\n   - Total Assets: 12,566,098.56\n   - 1,601,835.08 / 12,566,098.56 ≈ 0.1275 → 0.13 ✔\n\n2. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: 1,136,701.10\n   - Total Revenue: 6,836,701.10\n   - (1,136,701.10 / 6,836,701.10) * 100 ≈ 16.63% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n   - Net Operating Cash Flow: -6,856,840.58\n   - Current Liabilities: 1,601,835.08\n   - -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ -4.28 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided financial statements.",
