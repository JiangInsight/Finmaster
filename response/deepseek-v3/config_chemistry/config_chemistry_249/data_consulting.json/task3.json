In this case, it's the \"Total Current Liabilities\" because there are no non-current liabilities listed.\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\n2. **Identify Total Assets**: This is already provided in the balance sheet under \"Total Assets\".\n   - Total Assets = 12,566,098.56\n\n3. **Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio**: This is done by dividing Total Liabilities by Total Assets.\n   - Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n   - Debt to Asset Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 12,566,098.56 ≈ 0.1275\n\n4. **Round the Result**: Round the ratio to two decimal places for a standard presentation.\n   - Debt to Asset Ratio ≈ 0.13\n\nNow, let's present the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13'} }\n```",
