                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**\nGross Profit Margin is a profitability ratio that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Gross Profit = 1,136,701.10\n- Total Revenue = 6,836,701.10\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,136,701.10}{6,836,701.10} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,136,701.10}{6,836,701.10} \\approx 0.1663 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.1663 \\times 100 \\approx 16.63\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **16.63%**.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,856,840.58 (negative value)\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\nWe need to determine the \"Total Debt.\" Typically, total debt includes all interest-bearing liabilities. Looking at the balance sheet, the liabilities are:\n- Accounts Payable = 1,260,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 341,835.08\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\nHowever, \"Total Debt\" usually refers to long-term debt, but in this case, there's no separate long-term debt listed. The only liabilities are current (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable). \n\nBut in the example provided earlier, the \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\" was calculated using \"Total Current Liabilities\" as the denominator. Let's check:\n\nIn the example:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7,259,994.10\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\n- Ratio = -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90\n\nSo, it seems they used Total Current Liabilities as \"Debt\" for this ratio.\n\n**Applying the same here:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,856,840.58\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{1,601,835.08} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{1,601,835.08} \\approx -4.28 \\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-4.28**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '16.63%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-4.28'}}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Gross Profit Margin:**\n\\[ \\frac{1,136,701.10}{6,836,701.10} = 0.1663 \\]\n\\[ 0.1663 \\times 100 = 16.63\\% \\]\nCorrect.\n\n**Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:**\n\\[ \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{1,601,835.08} \\]\nCalculating:\n1,601,835.08 × 4 = 6,407,340.32\n6,856,840.58 - 6,407,340.32 = 449,500.26\nSo, 4 + (449,500.26 / 1,601,835.08) ≈ 4 + 0.28 = 4.28\nNegative because numerator is negative: -4.28\nCorrect.\n\nEverything checks out!",
