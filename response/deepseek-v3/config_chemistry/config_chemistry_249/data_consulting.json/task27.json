                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each of the three ratios we need to calculate: the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio, and the Quick Ratio. \n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how much cash flow is generated from operating activities relative to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,856,840.58\n- Net Profit = -2,035,736.52\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{-2,035,736.52} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{-2,035,736.52} \\approx 3.37 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is approximately 3.37.\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities was negative, and Net Profit was negative, and the ratio was positive (4.41). That makes sense because two negatives divided by each other give a positive. So, our calculation seems correct.\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to find the Average Current Assets. \n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Current Assets (at 2023-12-31) = 8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets (at 2024-02-01) = 7,000,260.27\n\nAverage Current Assets:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Initial} + \\text{End}}{2} = \\frac{8,000,000.00 + 7,000,260.27}{2} = \\frac{15,000,260.27}{2} = 7,500,130.135 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 6,836,701.10\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{6,836,701.10}{7,500,130.135} \\approx 0.9115 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.91\n\n*Checking the example*, their Current Assets Turnover Ratio was 0.68, which is less than 1, similar to our calculation here. So, it seems plausible.\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nWhere Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable (generally excludes inventory and other less liquid current assets).\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End amounts at 2024-02-01):\n- Cash on Hand = 376,598.62\n- Bank Deposits = 100,482.62\n- Interest Receivable = 5,155.34\n- Accounts Receivable = 3,098,023.69\n- Inventory = 3,420,000.00 (not included in quick assets)\n  \nQuick Assets:\n\\[ \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Interest Receivable} + \\text{Accounts Receivable} \\]\n\\[ = 376,598.62 + 100,482.62 + 5,155.34 + 3,098,023.69 \\]\n\\[ = 376,598.62 + 100,482.62 = 477,081.24 \\]\n\\[ 477,081.24 + 5,155.34 = 482,236.58 \\]\n\\[ 482,236.58 + 3,098,023.69 = 3,580,260.27 \\]\n\nCurrent Liabilities (End amount at 2024-02-01):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\nNow, calculate the Quick Ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{3,580,260.27}{1,601,835.08} \\approx 2.235 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 2.24\n\n*Checking the example*, their Quick Ratio was 1.54, which is also a reasonable number greater than 1, indicating good liquidity. Our calculation here is higher, but given the numbers, it seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating all three ratios:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: 3.37\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.91\n3. Quick Ratio: 2.24\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.37', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.91', 'Quick Ratio': '2.24'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me double-check the calculations quickly to ensure no mistakes.\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income:\n   - -6,856,840.58 / -2,035,736.52 = 3.368 (rounded to 3.37) ✅\n\n2. Current Assets Turnover:\n   - Average Current Assets: (8,000,000 + 7,000,260.27)/2 = 7,500,130.135\n   - 6,836,701.10 / 7,500,130.135 ≈ 0.9115 → 0.91 ✅\n\n3. Quick Ratio:\n   - Quick Assets: 376,598.62 + 100,482.62 + 5,155.34 + 3,098,023.69 = 3,580,260.27\n   - Current Liabilities: 1,601,835.08\n   - 3,580,260.27 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 2.235 → 2.24 ✅\n\nEverything checks out! \n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.37', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.91', 'Quick Ratio': '2.24'} }\n```",
