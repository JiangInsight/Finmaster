                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how I arrive at the numbers.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,856,840.58\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\nCalculation:\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ -4.28\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\nHere, \"Total Debt\" is typically the sum of all liabilities. From the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Debt = 1,601,835.08\n\nCalculation:\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ -4.28\n\n*Note: This seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio because total debt equals current liabilities in this case. Maybe there's more to debt, but based on the given data, this is it.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- COGS = 5,700,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- Ending Inventory = 3,420,000.00\n- Average Inventory = (Initial + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 3,420,000) / 2 = 1,710,000\n\nCalculation:\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = 5,700,000 / 1,710,000 ≈ 3.33\n\n*Wait a minute, in the example, the initial inventory was also 0, and they got 1.73 for COGS=4,410,000 and ending inventory=5,090,000. Their average would be (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000, so 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73, which matches. So my calculation seems correct.*\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08 (no non-current liabilities)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 10,964,263.48\n\nCalculation:\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48 ≈ 0.146 ≈ 0.15\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:**  \nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 7,000,260.27\n- Inventory = 3,420,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\nCalculation:\n- Quick Assets = 7,000,260.27 - 3,420,000.00 = 3,580,260.27\n- Quick Ratio = 3,580,260.27 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 2.24\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 7,000,260.27\n- Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\nCalculation:\n- Current Ratio = 7,000,260.27 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 4.37\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-4.28', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-4.28', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.33', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Quick Ratio': '2.24', 'Current Ratio': '4.37'} }\n```\n\n*Double-checking with the example:*\n- Their Operating Cash Flow Ratio was -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90 (matches given -3.90)\n- Cash Flow to Debt same as above (since total debt = current liabilities)\n- Inventory Turnover: 4,410,000 / ((0 + 5,090,000)/2) ≈ 1.73 (matches)\n- Debt to Equity: 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16 (matches)\n- Quick Ratio: (7,956,806.47 - 5,090,000) / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54 (matches)\n- Current Ratio: 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.27 (matches)\n\nMy calculations seem consistent with the example's methodology. The slight difference in Debt to Equity (0.15 vs. their 0.16) is likely due to rounding during intermediate steps. Similarly, Current Ratio is 4.37 vs. their 4.27 due to different numbers. \n\nThus, the final answer is accurate based on the provided data.",
