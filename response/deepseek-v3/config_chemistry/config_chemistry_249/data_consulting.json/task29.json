                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 1,601,835.08\n- Total Owner's Equity = 10,964,263.48\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48 ≈ 0.146\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit Margin = Net Profit / Total Revenue * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -2,035,736.52\n- Total Revenue = 6,836,701.10\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (-2,035,736.52 / 6,836,701.10) * 100 ≈ -29.78%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:**  \nROA = Net Profit / Total Assets * 100\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 12,566,098.56\n- Net Profit = -2,035,736.52\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (-2,035,736.52 / 12,566,098.56) * 100 ≈ -16.20%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales is given), we'll use Total Revenue as Net Credit Sales.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 6,836,701.10\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- End Accounts Receivable = 3,098,023.69\n- Initial Accounts Receivable (assuming it's 0 since it's not given, but the initial amount is 0 in the table) = 0\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = (0 + 3,098,023.69) / 2 = 1,549,011.845\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 6,836,701.10 / 1,549,011.845 ≈ 4.41\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Net Profit Margin': '-29.78%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-16.20%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.41'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48 ≈ 0.146 → Rounded to 0.15 (matches example format)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - -2,035,736.52 / 6,836,701.10 ≈ -0.2978 → -29.78% (matches example format)\n\n3. **ROA:**\n   - -2,035,736.52 / 12,566,098.56 ≈ -0.1620 → -16.20% (matches example format)\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:**\n   - 6,836,701.10 / 1,549,011.845 ≈ 4.413 → Rounded to 4.41 (matches example format)\n\nEverything checks out! The calculations seem correct based on the provided data.",
