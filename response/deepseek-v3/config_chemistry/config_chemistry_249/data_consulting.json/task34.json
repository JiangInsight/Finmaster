                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand what each term means and how to derive it from the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,856,840.58\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{1,601,835.08} \\approx -4.28 \\]\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 1,601,835.08\n- Total Owner's Equity = 10,964,263.48\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{1,601,835.08}{10,964,263.48} \\approx 0.146 \\]\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to generate sales from its assets by comparing net sales with average total assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\nSince we only have ending total assets (not beginning for the period), we'll use the ending total assets as an approximation for average total assets.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 6,836,701.10\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets (End) = 12,566,098.56\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{6,836,701.10}{12,566,098.56} \\approx 0.544 \\]\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Definition:** Also known as the acid-test ratio, it measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\nWhere Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 376,598.62\n- Bank Deposits = 100,482.62\n- Interest Receivable = 5,155.34\n- Accounts Receivable = 3,098,023.69\n- Quick Assets = 376,598.62 + 100,482.62 + 5,155.34 + 3,098,023.69 = 3,580,260.27\n- Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{3,580,260.27}{1,601,835.08} \\approx 2.235 \\]\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** Similar to the first ratio, it measures the ability to cover current liabilities with operating cash flow. It's the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = -4.28 \\]\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nUsing ending shareholder's equity as an approximation:\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -2,035,736.52\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Owner's Equity = 10,964,263.48\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{-2,035,736.52}{10,964,263.48} \\times 100\\% \\approx -18.57\\% \\]\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects receivables from customers. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nAssuming beginning accounts receivable is 0 (since initial amount is 0), and ending is 3,098,023.69, average is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 3,098,023.69}{2} = 1,549,011.845 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 6,836,701.10\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\frac{6,836,701.10}{1,549,011.845} \\approx 4.41 \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nNow, compiling all these calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-4.28', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.54', 'Quick Ratio': '2.24', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-4.28', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-18.57%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.41'} }\n```\n\n**Note:** Some ratios were rounded to two decimal places for clarity, matching the example's format. The exact values might slightly differ based on rounding during intermediate steps.",
