First, I'll look for transactions where the recorded_type doesn't match what's described in the invoice or where there are calculation inconsistencies.\n\n2. For transaction \"Sale20240110013\":\n- Recorded type is \"Depreciation\" but invoice describes a \"Sale\"\n- Recorded price is $13939.19 but invoice mentions $11994.85\n- Recorded amount is $13613.10 but invoice mentions $11994.85\n- Recorded tax is $11960.08 but invoice mentions $599.74\n- This appears to be a sale transaction incorrectly categorized as depreciation with incorrect amounts\n\n3. For transaction \"Purchase20231231001\":\n- Recorded amount is $340,000 (17 units × $20,000)\n- But invoice mentions 17 units at $20,000 totaling $340,000 - this matches correctly\n- No inconsistency found here\n\n4. For transaction \"Initial20231231001\":\n- There are 3 entries with same ID but different types (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) and different amounts\n- This appears to be separate initialization transactions with same ID - not necessarily an inconsistency\n\n5. For transaction \"Sale20240103003\":\n- Recorded amount is $166,756.74 (3 units × $55,585.58)\n- Cost is $150,000, tax $8,337.84, after-tax $158,418.90\n- Calculations match correctly: $166,756.74 - $8,337.84 = $158,418.90\n- No inconsistency found\n\nThe most significant inconsistency is in transaction \"Sale20240110013\" which is incorrectly categorized and has incorrect amounts.\n\nHere's the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Depreciation', 'Original date': '2024-01-10', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-10', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': 'Cash', 'Recorded payment_method': '', 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '1.0', 'Original price': '11994.85', 'Recorded price': '13939.19', 'Original receive_method': 'Cash', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Cash', 'Original amount': '11994.85', 'Recorded amount': '13613.1', 'Original tax': '599.74', 'Recorded tax': '11960.08', 'Original profit': '1994.85', 'Recorded profit': '1994.85', 'Original Preparer': '', 'Recorded Preparer': '', 'Original Approver': '', 'Recorded Approver': '', 'id': 'Sale20240110013'} }\n```",
