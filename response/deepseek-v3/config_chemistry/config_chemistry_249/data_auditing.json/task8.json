First, I'll look for transactions where the recorded amount doesn't match the calculated amount based on quantity and unit price.\n\n2. In transaction \"Sale20240118032\":\n   - Recorded amount: $26,857.86\n   - But the invoice description shows:\n     - Quantity: 1 unit\n     - Unit price: $23,625.51\n     - So calculated amount should be $23,625.51\n   - There's a discrepancy of $3,232.35 between recorded and calculated amount\n\n3. The tax amount is correctly calculated as 5% of the unit price ($1,181.28), and after-tax amount is correctly calculated as $22,444.23.\n\n4. All other fields seem consistent (cost amount, profit, payment status, etc.)\n\n5. This appears to be the only inconsistency in the dataset where the recorded amount doesn't match the calculated amount from quantity × unit price.\n\nHere's the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': '2024-01-18', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-18', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', 'Original payment_method': '', 'Recorded payment_method': '', 'Original quantity': '1.0', 'Recorded quantity': '1.0', 'Original price': '23625.51', 'Recorded price': '23625.51', 'Original receive_method': 'Cash', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Cash', 'Original amount': '23625.51', 'Recorded amount': '26857.86', 'Original tax': '1181.28', 'Recorded tax': '1181.28', 'Original profit': '3625.51', 'Recorded profit': '3625.51', 'Original Preparer': '', 'Recorded Preparer': '', 'Original Approver': '', 'Recorded Approver': '', 'id': 'Sale20240118032'} }\n```\n\nThe key issue is that the recorded amount ($26,857.86) doesn't match the calculated amount from quantity × unit price ($23,625.51). All other fields appear to be correctly recorded and consistent with each other. The correct amount should be $23,625.51 as shown in the invoice description.",
