I'm going to break it down to understand what exactly we're being asked to do and how to find the correct answers.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task is to identify and extract two specific line items from the provided financial statements:\n\n1. **End value of funds deposited into a bank**: This likely refers to the ending amount in \"Bank Deposits\" from the balance sheet.\n2. **Income earned by an entity from financial assets**: This probably refers to \"Interest Income\" from the income statement, as interest is typically earned from financial assets like bank deposits or investments.\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\nGiven that, in the examples provided, the solution only includes two values, 'value1' and 'value2', corresponding to the two line items we're interested in, in the order mentioned.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Example\n\nLooking at the example:\n\n- **Balance Sheet**: There's a line item \"Bank Deposits\" with an \"End_amount\" of \"164645.57\".\n- **Income Statement**: There's a line item \"Interest Income\" with an \"Amount\" of \"2672.87\".\n\nThe solution is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '164645.57', 'value2': '2672.87'}}\n```\nThis confirms that:\n- 'value1' is the end amount of bank deposits (from the balance sheet).\n- 'value2' is the interest income (from the income statement).\n\n### Applying This to the New Problem\n\nNow, let's look at the new problem's financial statements to find these two values.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the balance sheet table, we find:\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bank Deposits | 5000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | **100482.62** | 2024-02-01 |\n\nSo, the end value of funds deposited into the bank is **100482.62**.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nLooking at the income statement table, we find:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Interest Income | **5155.34** | 2024-02-01 |\n\nSo, the income earned from financial assets is **5155.34**.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nInterestingly, the cash flow statement wasn't used in the example solution, and in this problem, we're only asked for two values, which we've already found from the balance sheet and income statement. So, we can ignore the cash flow statement for this task.\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe order is:\n1. Balance Sheet (Bank Deposits)\n2. Income Statement (Interest Income)\n\nThis matches the example where 'value1' was from the balance sheet and 'value2' from the income statement.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- 'value1': '100482.62' (Bank Deposits end amount from Balance Sheet)\n- 'value2': '5155.34' (Interest Income from Income Statement)\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '100482.62', 'value2': '5155.34'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the required line items**:\n   - Funds deposited into a bank → \"Bank Deposits\" in the Balance Sheet.\n   - Income from financial assets → \"Interest Income\" in the Income Statement.\n\n2. **Locate these items in the provided statements**:\n   - Found \"Bank Deposits\" with \"End_amount\" of 100482.62 in the Balance Sheet.\n   - Found \"Interest Income\" with \"Amount\" of 5155.34 in the Income Statement.\n\n3. **Ensure the order matches the example**:\n   - Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement.\n\n4. **Construct the JSON solution** with the two values in the correct order.\n\nThus, the final answer is as above.",
