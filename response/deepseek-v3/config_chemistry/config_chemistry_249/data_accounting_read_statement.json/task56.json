This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Depreciation**: Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. It appears in multiple parts of the financial statements:\n   - **Balance Sheet**: Under \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which shows the total depreciation accumulated over time.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: Under \"Depreciation\" in the operating activities section, which shows the depreciation expense for the period.\n   - **Income Statement**: Under \"Depreciation\" in the expenses section, which also shows the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n2. **Locating Depreciation in the Given Problem**:\n   - In the **balance sheet**, \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is listed with an end amount of `100239.89`. This is the total accumulated depreciation up to the end date.\n   - In the **cash flow statement**, \"Depreciation\" is listed with an amount of `100239.89`. This is the depreciation expense for the period.\n   - In the **income statement**, \"Depreciation\" is listed with an amount of `100239.89`. This is also the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n3. **Choosing the Correct Value**:\n   - The task asks for the \"systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life,\" which is the depreciation expense for the period. This is reflected in both the cash flow statement and the income statement as `100239.89`.\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" in the balance sheet is the cumulative total, not the periodic allocation, so it is not the correct value for this task.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The correct value to extract is `100239.89`, as it represents the depreciation expense for the period in question.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '100239.89'}}\n```",
