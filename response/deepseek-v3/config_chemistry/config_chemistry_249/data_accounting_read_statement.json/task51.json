This account records the interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial Value**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, under the \"Account\" column, we find \"Interest Receivable\".\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Interest Receivable\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Locate the End Value**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Interest Receivable\" is `5155.34` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-01`.\n\n4. **Verify with Other Statements**:\n   - The cash flow statement shows a line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\" with an amount of `-5155.34`, which matches the change in the \"Interest Receivable\" account (from `0.00` to `5155.34`).\n   - The income statement shows \"Interest Income\" of `5155.34`, which is the income recognized from the interest accrued but not yet received. This matches the \"End_amount\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5155.34'}}\n```",
