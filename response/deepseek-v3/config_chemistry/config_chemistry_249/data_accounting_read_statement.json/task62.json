The end value is the amount owed at the end of the period.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is typically found in the **Income Statement** under \"Financial Expenses\". The amount listed here represents the financing costs.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is typically found in the **Cash Flow Statement** under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\". The amount listed here represents the cash payments for long-term assets.\n\nLet's extract these values step by step from the given problem:\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet: Accounts Receivable\n- In the Balance Sheet, the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item has an \"End_amount\" of `3098023.69`. This represents the amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n### 2. Income Statement: Financial Expenses\n- In the Income Statement, the \"Financial Expenses\" line item has an \"Amount\" of `657075.51`. This represents the financing costs incurred by the enterprise.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement: Purchase of Fixed Assets\n- In the Cash Flow Statement, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item has an \"Amount\" of `666078.18`. This represents the cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3098023.69', 'value2': '657075.51', 'value3': '666078.18'} }\n```",
