This line item is typically called \"Retained Earnings.\"\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet, we can see the following entries for \"Retained Earnings\":\n\n- **Initial_amount**: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- **End_amount**: -2035736.52 (as of 2024-02-01)\n\nThese values indicate that the entity started with no retained earnings at the initial date and ended with a negative retained earnings (indicating accumulated losses) at the end date.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '-2035736.52'} }\n```",
