These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are those that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle (usually one year). In the given balance sheet, the non-current assets are listed under \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation.\"\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is given under \"Total Non-current Assets\" at the initial date (2023-12-31), which is `5000000.00`.\n   - The end value of non-current assets is given under \"Total Non-current Assets\" at the end date (2024-02-01), which is `5565838.29`.\n\n3. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is `5000000.00`, and the initial \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `0.00`, so the total initial non-current assets are `5000000.00`.\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is `5666078.18`, and the end \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `100239.89`, so the net non-current assets are `5666078.18 - 100239.89 = 5565838.29`, which matches the \"Total Non-current Assets\" value.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5565838.29'}}\n```",
