These are typically referred to as \"Current Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the normal operating cycle of the business. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all such assets.\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is the value at the beginning of the period (initial value).\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is the value at the end of the period (end value).\n\n3. **Extract Values**:\n   - From the given problem, the \"Total Current Assets\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 8000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 7000260.27 (as of 2024-02-01)\n\n4. **Verify**: Ensure that the values correspond to the \"Total Current Assets\" line and not other categories like \"Total Non-current Assets\" or \"Total Assets\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7000260.27'}}\n```",
