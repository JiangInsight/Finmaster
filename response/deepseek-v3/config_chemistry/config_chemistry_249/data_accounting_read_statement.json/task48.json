In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit.\"\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Net Profit**:\n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Net Profit\" in the cash flow statement.\n   - In the given problem, the \"Net Profit\" amount is `-2035736.52`.\n\n2. **Identify Purchase of Fixed Assets**:\n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement.\n   - In the given problem, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" amount is `666078.18`.\n\n3. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The first value (`value1`) is the \"Net Profit\" amount.\n   - The second value (`value2`) is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" amount.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-2035736.52', 'value2': '666078.18'} }\n```",
