This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: The amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is recorded under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet and cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Check the Balance Sheet**: \n   - In the balance sheet, the \"Accounts Payable\" line shows an initial amount of `0.00` and an end amount of `1260000.00`. This indicates an increase of `1260000.00` during the period.\n\n3. **Verify with the Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - In the cash flow statement, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" shows a value of `1260000.00`, which confirms the increase in accounts payable during the period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is `1260000.00`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1260000.00'}}\n```",
