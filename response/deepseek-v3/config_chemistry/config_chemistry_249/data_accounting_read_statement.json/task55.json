This is typically found in the \"Tax Expense\" line in the income statement or \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet. \n\n2. **Locate the value in the financial statements**:\n   - In the **income statement**, the \"Tax Expense\" line shows the amount of tax for the reporting period. Here, it is listed as `341835.08` under the \"Tax Expense\" account.\n   - In the **balance sheet**, the \"Taxes Payable\" line under current liabilities also shows `341835.08`, which matches the tax expense from the income statement. This confirms the amount of tax expected to be paid.\n\n3. **Verify consistency**: The \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" in the cash flow statement is `341835.08`, which aligns with the other two statements, further confirming the value.\n\n4. **Extract the value**: The consistent value across all relevant line items is `341835.08`.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '341835.08'} }\n```",
