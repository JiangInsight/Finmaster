This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task asks for the value that shows the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit. This is captured by the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item in the cash flow statement. A decrease in accounts receivable means that the entity has collected more cash from its customers than the credit sales made during the period.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item labeled \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\" \n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-3098023.69.\" The negative sign indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., more credit sales than cash collected), but the absolute value represents the change in amounts owed to the entity.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The value to be extracted is \"-3098023.69.\"\n\nHere is the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3098023.69'}}\n```",
