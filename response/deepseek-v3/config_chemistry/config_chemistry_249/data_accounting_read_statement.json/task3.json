This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the money owed to the entity by its customers for goods or services delivered on credit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet. This is the standard term used for amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" column shows the value at the beginning of the period (initial value).\n   - The \"End_amount\" column shows the value at the end of the period (end value).\n\n3. **Locate the Values in the Given Problem**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, \"Accounts Receivable\" has:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 3098023.69 (as of 2024-02-01)\n\n### Solution:\nThe initial and end values for \"Accounts Receivable\" are 0.00 and 3098023.69, respectively.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3098023.69'}}\n```",
