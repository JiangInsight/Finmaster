These liabilities are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the entity's normal operating cycle, usually within one year. In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\".\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" line provides the aggregate value of all current liabilities.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is given as \"0.00\" on the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n   - **End Value**: The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is given as \"1601835.08\" on the \"End_date\" of \"2024-02-01\".\n\n3. **Verify Line Items**:\n   - The individual current liabilities (\"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\") sum up to the \"Total Current Liabilities\":\n     - Accounts Payable: 1260000.00\n     - Taxes Payable: 341835.08\n     - Total: 1260000.00 + 341835.08 = 1601835.08 (matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" end value).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1601835.08'} }\n```",
