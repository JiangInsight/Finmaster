This is typically listed under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" represents the change in the amount of tax that is owed but not yet paid. \n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is `341835.08`. This is the amount by which the tax payable has increased during the period.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The value is positive, indicating an increase in tax payable (i.e., more tax has been accrued but not yet paid). This aligns with the task's requirement to find the increase in tax accrued but not yet paid.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '341835.08'} }\n```",
