A negative value indicates an increase in inventory (which is a use of cash), and a positive value indicates a decrease in inventory (which is a source of cash). \n\nLooking at the provided problem, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" has a value of \"-3420000.00\". This means there was an increase in inventory, which corresponds to a reduction in cash flow.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Locate the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" in the cash flow statement.\n2. Extract the value associated with this line item, which is \"-3420000.00\".\n3. This value represents the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale or in production.\n\nThe solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3420000.00'}}\n```",
