                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what we're being asked to find and then locate those specific pieces of information in the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under equity items like \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Share Capital.\"\n   \n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is usually referred to as \"Profit Before Tax\" and is found in the Income Statement.\n   \n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This relates to changes in \"Accounts Payable,\" which can be seen in the Cash Flow Statement under operating activities as \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Example\n\nLooking at the example provided:\n\n- **Balance Sheet**: The \"Paid-in Capital\" is `13000000.00` (value1).\n- **Income Statement**: \"Profit Before Tax\" is `-1373590.51` (value2).\n- **Cash Flow Statement**: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is `1590000.00` (value3).\n\nThis gives us the solution: `{'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1373590.51', 'value3': '1590000.00'}`.\n\n### Solving the Current Problem\n\nNow, let's apply this to the current problem.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet: Capital contributed by shareholders\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet section, we search for equity items related to capital contributed by shareholders. We find:\n\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\n\nThis indicates that the capital contributed by shareholders is `13000000.00`. This will be our `value1`.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement: Profit before tax\n\nIn the Income Statement, we look for \"Profit Before Tax\":\n\n```\nProfit Before Tax | -1693901.44 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\n\nSo, the profit before tax is `-1693901.44`. This will be our `value2`.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement: Increase in accounts payable\n\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, under operating activities, we find:\n\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 1260000.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\n\nThis shows an increase in accounts payable by `1260000.00`. This will be our `value3`.\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe order is:\n\n1. Balance Sheet (`Paid-in Capital`) → `value1`\n2. Income Statement (`Profit Before Tax`) → `value2`\n3. Cash Flow Statement (`Increase in Accounts Payable`) → `value3`\n\nThis matches the required grouping and order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1693901.44', 'value3': '1260000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify Capital Contributed by Shareholders**:\n   - Looked at the Balance Sheet under equity.\n   - Found \"Paid-in Capital\" with an end amount of `13000000.00` → `value1`.\n\n2. **Identify Profit Before Tax**:\n   - Looked at the Income Statement.\n   - Found \"Profit Before Tax\" as `-1693901.44` → `value2`.\n\n3. **Identify Increase in Accounts Payable**:\n   - Looked at the Cash Flow Statement under operating activities.\n   - Found \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" as `1260000.00` → `value3`.\n\n4. **Ensure Correct Order**:\n   - Balanced Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n   - Maintained original line item order within each statement.\n\nThus, the final solution is correctly assembled as above.",
