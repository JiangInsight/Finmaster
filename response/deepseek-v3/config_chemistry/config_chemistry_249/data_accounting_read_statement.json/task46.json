Here, the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is the only component listed under investing activities, and it directly contributes to the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\". \n\n1. **Identify the main value**: The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is given as \"-666078.18\". This is the net amount of cash generated from investing activities.\n2. **Identify the sub-item**: The only sub-item contributing to this net amount is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of \"666078.18\". This is a cash outflow, hence the negative sign in the net cash flow.\n\nThus, the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-666078.18', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '666078.18'}}}\n```",
