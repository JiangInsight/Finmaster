This line item is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to extract the value associated with depreciation from the cash flow statement. Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item labeled \"Depreciation\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n3. **Extract the Value**: Once the \"Depreciation\" line is found, note the corresponding amount listed in the \"Amount\" column.\n\n### Application to the Given Problem:\n- In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Depreciation\" line item is present with an amount of `100239.89` for the date `2024-02-01`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '100239.89'}}\n```",
