This is typically found under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section of the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section includes the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which represents cash payments for acquiring PP&E and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is the amount we are looking for. In the given problem, this value is `666078.18`.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is `-666078.18`, which matches the negative of the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" value, confirming that this is the only cash outflow in the investing activities section.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '666078.18'}}\n```",
