Typically, this is listed as \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Share Capital\" on the balance sheet under the Owner's Equity section. \n\nFrom the provided balance sheet, we can see the following line items under Owner's Equity:\n- Paid-in Capital: Initial_amount = 13000000.00, End_amount = 13000000.00\n- Retained Earnings: Initial_amount = 0.00, End_amount = -2035736.52\n- Total Owner's Equity: Initial_amount = 13000000.00, End_amount = 10964263.48\n\nThe \"Paid-in Capital\" line item directly represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares. Both the initial and end values for this line item are 13000000.00, indicating no change during the period.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
