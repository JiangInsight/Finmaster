These amounts are typically listed under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item that represents amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is \"Accounts Payable\". This is a liability account that shows the amount the entity owes to its suppliers or vendors.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and End Values**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, \"Accounts Payable\" has an initial amount of `0.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - The end amount for \"Accounts Payable\" is `1260000.00` as of the end date `2024-02-01`.\n\n3. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00`.\n   - The end value is `1260000.00`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1260000.00'} }\n```",
