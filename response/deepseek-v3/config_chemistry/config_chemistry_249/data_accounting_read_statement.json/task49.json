I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific pieces of information from the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This typically refers to the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" because accounts payable represent amounts owed for goods or services received on credit.\n   \n2. **Acquisition of property, plant and equipment**: This is usually listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement.\n   \n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: This is the \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Cash Flow Statement\nLet's look at the given cash flow statement and find these items.\n\n#### 1. Increase in Accounts Payable\nLooking under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\", we see:\n- \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": 1260000.00\n\nThis is the first value we need (`value1`).\n\n#### 2. Purchase of Fixed Assets\nUnder \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", we find:\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": 666078.18\n\nThis is the second value (`value2`).\n\n#### 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents at Beginning of Period\nUnder \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\", we see:\n- \"Beginning Balance\": 8000000.00\n\nThis is the third value (`value3`).\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe task mentions that for multiple outputs, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the statement:\n\n1. \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" appears before...\n2. \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\", which appears before...\n3. \"Beginning Balance\".\n\nSo, the order is correct as is.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1260000.00', 'value2': '666078.18', 'value3': '8000000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Identify Accounts Payable Increase**: Found under operating activities as \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with value `1260000.00`.\n2. **Identify Purchase of Fixed Assets**: Found under investing activities as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with value `666078.18`.\n3. **Identify Beginning Cash Balance**: Found under cash and cash equivalents as \"Beginning Balance\" with value `8000000.00`.\n4. **Ensure Order**: The order in the statement matches the required output order.\n5. **Construct JSON**: Format the values into the required JSON structure.\n\nThis method ensures that we accurately extract and present the required information from the cash flow statement.",
