This section typically includes:\n   - Beginning Balance: The amount of cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n   - Ending Balance: The amount of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period.\n   - Net Increase/Decrease: The change in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n3. **Identify the Ending Balance**: The \"Ending Balance\" is the value of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period, which is what we are tasked to extract.\n4. **Extract the Value**: From the given problem, under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, the \"Ending Balance\" is listed as `477081.24`.\n\n### Solution:\nThe value of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period is `477081.24`. \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '477081.24'} }\n```",
