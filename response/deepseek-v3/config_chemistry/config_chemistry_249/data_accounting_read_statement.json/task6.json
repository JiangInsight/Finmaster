These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The line item \"Fixed Assets\" represents tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes. This is the primary item we are interested in.\n   - \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is related to fixed assets but represents the depreciation over time, not the tangible value itself. The net value of fixed assets is often reflected in \"Total Non-current Assets,\" but we are specifically asked for the tangible items' initial and end values, which are the \"Fixed Assets\" line.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, the \"Fixed Assets\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 5666078.18 (as of 2024-02-01)\n\n3. **Verify Other Line Items**:\n   - Other line items like \"Cash on Hand,\" \"Bank Deposits,\" \"Inventory,\" etc., are either current assets or not tangible items held for production/supply/rental/administrative purposes. Thus, they are not relevant for this task.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value of tangible items (Fixed Assets) is '5000000.00'.\n   - The end value of tangible items (Fixed Assets) is '5666078.18'.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5666078.18'} }\n```",
