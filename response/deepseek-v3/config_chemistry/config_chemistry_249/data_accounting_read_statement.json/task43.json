This is typically labeled as \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the section titled \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\". This section usually contains the beginning balance, ending balance, and net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n3. **Identify the Line Item**: Under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, the line item \"Beginning Balance\" represents the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Beginning Balance\" is the amount we need to extract. In the given problem, this value is \"8000000.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
