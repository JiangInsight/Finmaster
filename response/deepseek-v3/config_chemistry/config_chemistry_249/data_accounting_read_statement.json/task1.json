This typically includes \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" as these are the most liquid assets that can be readily used for daily operations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The balance sheet includes \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" which are the primary sources of cash available for day-to-day operations.\n   - Other items like \"Interest Receivable\", \"Accounts Receivable\", and \"Inventory\" are not considered as cash available for immediate use.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Values**:\n   - The initial value for \"Cash on Hand\" is `3000000.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - The initial value for \"Bank Deposits\" is `5000000.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - The total initial cash available is the sum of these two values: `3000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 8000000.00`.\n\n3. **Extract End Values**:\n   - The end value for \"Cash on Hand\" is `376598.62` as of `2024-02-01`.\n   - The end value for \"Bank Deposits\" is `100482.62` as of `2024-02-01`.\n   - The total end cash available is the sum of these two values: `376598.62 + 100482.62 = 477081.24`.\n\n4. **Verify Against Total Current Assets**:\n   - The \"Total Current Assets\" at the initial date is `8000000.00`, which matches the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" (since other current assets like \"Accounts Receivable\" and \"Inventory\" were initially `0.00`).\n   - The \"Total Current Assets\" at the end date is `7000260.27`, which includes other items like \"Accounts Receivable\" and \"Inventory\". The cash portion is only `477081.24`.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value of cash available for day-to-day operations is `8000000.00`.\n   - The end value of cash available for day-to-day operations is `477081.24`.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '477081.24'} }\n```",
