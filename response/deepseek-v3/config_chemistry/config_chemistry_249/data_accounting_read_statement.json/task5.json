These assets are typically categorized under \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The balance sheet provided includes an \"Inventory\" line item, which represents goods held for sale in the ordinary course of business or in production for such sale.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Inventory\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Inventory\" is `3420000.00` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-02-01`.\n\n3. **Verify Context**:\n   - No other line items (e.g., \"Accounts Receivable\", \"Fixed Assets\") fit the description of assets held for sale or in production for sale. \"Inventory\" is the only relevant item.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3420000.00'} }\n```",
