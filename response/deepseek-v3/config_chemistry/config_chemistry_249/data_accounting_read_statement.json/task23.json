Typically, this is referred to as \"Interest Income\" in income statements, as it represents earnings from investments or financial instruments like bonds, savings accounts, or other interest-bearing assets.\n\n2. **Review the Income Statement**: Look through the provided income statement for any line items that could represent income from financial assets. The relevant line items are usually under the \"Other Income\" or \"Non-Operating Income\" sections, but in this case, it is explicitly listed as \"Interest Income.\"\n\n3. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Interest Income\" is present with an amount of \"5155.34\" dated \"2024-02-01.\"\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Interest Income\" is \"5155.34,\" which is the income earned from financial assets.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5155.34'}}\n```",
