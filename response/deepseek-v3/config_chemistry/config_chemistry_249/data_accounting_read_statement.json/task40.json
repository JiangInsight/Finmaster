                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify the specific line item in the cash flow statement that represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task asks for the value of the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is directly related to \"Accounts Payable,\" which is a liability representing amounts owed to suppliers or vendors for credit purchases.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item that indicates a change in \"Accounts Payable.\" This is found under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Identify the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is the amount by which the accounts payable have increased during the period. In the given problem, this value is \"1260000.00.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Sign**: The value is positive, indicating an increase in accounts payable, which aligns with the task's requirement (addition in the amount owed).\n\n5. **Construct the Solution**: The solution is the value identified in the previous step.\n\nHere is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1260000.00'}}\n```",
