                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to look at the income statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities**\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**\n\n### Step 1: Identify Total Income from Ordinary Activities\nFirst, we need to find the total income that comes from the entity's ordinary activities. In an income statement, this is typically represented by the \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue\" because these are the incomes generated from the main operations of the business.\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n- \"Main Business Revenue\" is 6,836,701.10\n- \"Total Revenue\" is also 6,836,701.10\n\nBoth represent the income from ordinary activities. Since \"Total Revenue\" is a more comprehensive term, we'll use that. So, `value1` is \"6836701.10\".\n\n### Step 2: Identify Carrying Amount of Inventories Sold\nNext, we need the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period. This is essentially the cost associated with the goods that were sold. In income statements, this is usually labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is 5,700,000.00\n\nThis matches what we're looking for. So, `value2` is \"5700000.00\".\n\n### Step 3: Identify Costs of General Management and Administration\nFinally, we need the costs related to general management and administration of the entity as a whole. These are typically the overhead costs not directly tied to production or sales. In income statements, this is often labeled as \"Administrative Expenses\".\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- \"Administrative Expenses\" is 1,600,726.63\n\nThis fits our requirement. So, `value3` is \"1600726.63\".\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe problem asks us to maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the order in the income statement:\n1. Main Business Revenue / Total Revenue (first items)\n2. Cost of Goods Sold (appears early)\n3. Administrative Expenses (appears after Gross Profit)\n\nThis matches the order we've assigned to value1, value2, and value3 respectively.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6836701.10', 'value2': '5700000.00', 'value3': '1600726.63'}}\n```",
