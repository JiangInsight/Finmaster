                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Gross Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"Gross Profit Margin\" means. From what I recall, the Gross Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n\nThe formula for Gross Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Gross Profit** = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n- **Total Revenue** is the total income from sales before any expenses are deducted.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 7,825,951.24\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 6,290,000.00\n- **Gross Profit**: 1,535,951.24\n\nWait a minute, the Gross Profit is already given as 1,535,951.24. That's good; it means we don't need to calculate it separately since it's provided. \n\nBut just to confirm, let's calculate Gross Profit using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{COGS} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit} = 7,825,951.24 - 6,290,000.00 = 1,535,951.24 \\]\n\nThis matches the given Gross Profit, so we're on the right track.\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nNow, plug the values into the Gross Profit Margin formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,535,951.24}{7,825,951.24} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,535,951.24}{7,825,951.24} \\approx 0.1963 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.1963 \\times 100 \\approx 19.63\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let's re-calculate:\n\n1,535,951.24 ÷ 7,825,951.24 ≈ 0.1963\n\n0.1963 × 100 = 19.63%\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\n### Comparing with the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example:\n\n- Gross Profit: 1,021,018.59\n- Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Gross Profit Margin: 18.80%\n\nCalculating that:\n\n(1,021,018.59 / 5,431,018.59) × 100 ≈ 18.80%\n\nSo, the method seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the Gross Profit Margin for the given problem is approximately **19.63%**.\n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '19.63%'} }\n```",
