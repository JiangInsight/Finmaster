I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio based on the given balance sheet information. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Equity Ratio\nFirst, I need to understand what the Debt to Equity Ratio is. From what I recall, it's a financial ratio that compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt versus wholly owned funds.\n\nThe formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Components\nNow, looking at the balance sheet provided, I need to identify:\n1. **Total Liabilities**: This seems to be the sum of all the company's debts or obligations.\n2. **Total Shareholders' Equity**: This is the owners' claim after all liabilities have been paid off.\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Total Current Liabilities** at the end of the period is 2,491,297.55.\n- There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so it seems the company only has current liabilities.\n- **Total Owner's Equity** at the end of the period is 11,598,563.11.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nGiven that:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = 11,598,563.11\n\nNow, plug these into the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{2,491,297.55}{11,598,563.11} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{2,491,297.55}{11,598,563.11} \\approx 0.2148 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, it's approximately 0.21.\n\n### Verifying the Numbers\nJust to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n- The balance sheet shows that \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" equals \"Total Assets\" at the end, which is good for consistency.\n- The only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" so it seems correct to use that as the total liabilities.\n- Owner's equity is clearly given as \"Total Owner's Equity.\"\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.21.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21'} }\n```",
