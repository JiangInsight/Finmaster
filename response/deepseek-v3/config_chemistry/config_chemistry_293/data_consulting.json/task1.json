From the given balance sheet, the \"Total Current Assets\" at the end of the reporting period (2024-01-30) is **8,810,936.45**.\n\n2. **Identify Current Liabilities**: Current liabilities are obligations that are due within one year. From the given balance sheet, the \"Total Current Liabilities\" at the end of the reporting period (2024-01-30) is **2,491,297.55**.\n\n3. **Calculate Current Ratio**: The Current Ratio is calculated by dividing the total current assets by the total current liabilities.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{8,810,936.45}{2,491,297.55}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} \\approx 3.54\n   \\]\n\n4. **Present the Solution**: The Current Ratio is rounded to two decimal places.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.54'} }\n```",
