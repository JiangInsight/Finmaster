                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. I'll go through each one, explaining how to compute them using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 2,491,297.55\n- There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so we'll assume Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 14,089,860.66\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{2,491,297.55}{14,089,860.66} \\approx 0.1768 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.18\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 1,535,951.24\n- **Total Revenue:** 7,825,951.24\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,535,951.24}{7,825,951.24} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 19.63\\% \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 19.63%\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -4,398,760.38\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 2,491,297.55\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{2,491,297.55} \\approx -1.765 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -1.77\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.18', 'Gross Profit Margin': '19.63%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77'}}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - 2,491,297.55 / 14,089,860.66 ≈ 0.1768 → 0.18 ✔\n\n2. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - 1,535,951.24 / 7,825,951.24 ≈ 0.1963 → 19.63% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n   - -4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ -1.765 → -1.77 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided financial statements.",
