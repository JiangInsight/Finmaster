In this case, it is -4,398,760.38.\n\n2. **Identify the Total Debt**: The total debt is the sum of all liabilities. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" which is 2,491,297.55. There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so the total debt is 2,491,297.55.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{2,491,297.55} \\approx -1.765\n   \\]\n\n4. **Round the Result**: Rounding to two decimal places gives -1.77.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77'}}\n```",
