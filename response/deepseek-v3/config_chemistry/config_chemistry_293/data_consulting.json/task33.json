                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how to calculate it and then applying the numbers from the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,398,760.38\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{2,491,297.55} \\approx -1.77 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nHere, \"Total Debt\" is essentially the \"Total Current Liabilities\" since there are no long-term liabilities mentioned.\n- Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{2,491,297.55} \\approx -1.77 \\]\n\n*Note: This seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio because the company has no long-term debt, only current liabilities.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 6,290,000.00\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Ending Inventory = 3,540,000.00\nAssuming no beginning inventory (since initial amount is 0), Average Inventory = (0 + 3,540,000) / 2 = 1,770,000.00\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{6,290,000.00}{1,770,000.00} \\approx 3.55 \\]\n\n*Wait a minute, in the example provided, the Inventory Turnover Ratio was calculated differently. They seemed to use only the ending inventory, not average. Maybe the initial inventory is not considered here. Let me check:*\n\nIf we use only Ending Inventory:\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{6,290,000.00}{3,540,000.00} \\approx 1.78 \\]\n\nThis matches the example's approach where they likely used ending inventory only. So, I'll go with this.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio compares the company's total debt to its shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nTotal Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\nTotal Owner's Equity = 11,598,563.11\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{2,491,297.55}{11,598,563.11} \\approx 0.21 \\]\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 1,753,673.43\n- Bank Deposits = 1,522,888.62\n- Interest Receivable = 5,758.38\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,988,616.02\nTotal Quick Assets = 1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 + 5,758.38 + 1,988,616.02 = 5,270,936.45\nCurrent Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{5,270,936.45}{2,491,297.55} \\approx 2.12 \\]\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 8,810,936.45\n- Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{8,810,936.45}{2,491,297.55} \\approx 3.54 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling all these calculations into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '1.78', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Quick Ratio': '2.12', 'Current Ratio': '3.54'} }\n```\n\n**Verification with Example:**\nLooking back at the example provided, their ratios were:\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -3.90\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -3.90\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 1.73\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.16\n- Quick Ratio: 1.54\n- Current Ratio: 4.27\n\nOur calculations seem in line with their approach, just with different numbers leading to different ratios. The methods appear consistent. \n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n- For Inventory Turnover, if we consider average inventory, it would be higher (3.55), but based on the example, using ending inventory seems correct.\n- For Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, since there's no long-term debt, it's the same as Operating Cash Flow Ratio here.\n\nThus, the final answer stands as above.",
