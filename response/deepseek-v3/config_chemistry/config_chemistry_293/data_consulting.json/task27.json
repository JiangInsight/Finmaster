                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one to understand how to compute them based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how much cash flow is generated from operating activities relative to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,398,760.38\n- Net Profit = -1,401,436.89\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{-1,401,436.89} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{-1,401,436.89} \\approx 3.14 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is approximately **3.14**.\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the ratio was positive even though both numbers were negative. That makes sense because dividing two negatives gives a positive. So, 3.14 seems correct.\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to find the average current assets. Average current assets are calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Current Assets} + \\text{End Current Assets}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Current Assets (2023-12-31) = 8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets (2024-01-30) = 8,810,936.45\n\nCalculating average:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average} = \\frac{8,000,000.00 + 8,810,936.45}{2} = \\frac{16,810,936.45}{2} = 8,405,468.225 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 7,825,951.24\n\nNow, the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{7,825,951.24}{8,405,468.225} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7,825,951.24}{8,405,468.225} \\approx 0.93 \\]\n\nSo, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio is approximately **0.93**.\n\n*Checking the example*, their revenue was 5,431,018.59 and average current assets were about (8,000,000 + 7,956,806.47)/2 ≈ 7,978,403.235, giving a ratio of ~0.68, which matches their solution. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nWhere Quick Assets are:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} + \\text{Marketable Securities} + \\text{Accounts Receivable} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end period):\n- Cash on Hand = 1,753,673.43\n- Bank Deposits = 1,522,888.62\n- Interest Receivable = 5,758.38\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,988,616.02\n\nAssuming Cash and Cash Equivalents = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits (since interest receivable is a separate line and might not be as liquid):\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} = 1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 = 3,276,562.05 \\]\n*(This matches the \"Ending Balance\" under Cash and Cash Equivalents in the cash flow statement.)*\n\nAdding Accounts Receivable:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 3,276,562.05 + 1,988,616.02 = 5,265,178.07 \\]\n*(Interest Receivable is usually included in quick assets, but sometimes it's excluded if not expected to be liquid quickly. For thoroughness, let's include it:)*\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 3,276,562.05 + 1,988,616.02 + 5,758.38 = 5,270,936.45 \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{5,270,936.45}{2,491,297.55} \\approx 2.12 \\]\n\nIf we exclude Interest Receivable:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,265,178.07}{2,491,297.55} \\approx 2.11 \\]\n\nThe example had a quick ratio of 1.54, calculated likely as (Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities = (270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,429,482.13) / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 2,864,133.60 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54.\n\nIn our case, similar calculation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Accounts Receivable} = 1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 + 1,988,616.02 = 5,265,178.07 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{5,265,178.07}{2,491,297.55} \\approx 2.11 \\]\n\nBut the example included interest receivable in quick assets, but their quick ratio was lower because their cash equivalents were much smaller. Maybe in practice, interest receivable isn't always included. For consistency with the example, let's exclude interest receivable, giving us **2.11**.\n\nHowever, looking back, the example might have only included Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable, excluding interest receivable. So, following that:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 1,753,673.43 (\\text{Cash}) + 1,522,888.62 (\\text{Bank}) + 1,988,616.02 (\\text{AR}) = 5,265,178.07 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{5,265,178.07}{2,491,297.55} \\approx 2.11 \\]\n\nBut the example's quick assets were cash + bank + AR, totaling ~2.86M / 1.86M ≈ 1.54. So, seems correct to include cash, bank, and AR.\n\nThus, our quick ratio is **2.11**.\n\nBut wait, the initial amounts for cash and bank deposits are the beginning balances. Maybe we should use ending balances only, which we have:\n\nFrom balance sheet end amounts:\n- Cash on Hand: 1,753,673.43\n- Bank Deposits: 1,522,888.62\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,988,616.02\nTotal quick assets: 1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 + 1,988,616.02 = 5,265,178.07\nCurrent liabilities: 2,491,297.55\nQuick ratio: 5,265,178.07 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ 2.11\n\nThis seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating all three ratios:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: 3.14\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.93\n3. Quick Ratio: 2.11\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, their Operating Cash Flow to Net Income was positive despite both numbers being negative, which is correct mathematically (negative divided by negative is positive). So, our calculation is correct.\n\nSimilarly, the other ratios seem correctly calculated based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.14', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.93', 'Quick Ratio': '2.11'} }\n```\n\n*Wait*, let me double-check the quick assets inclusion. Should Interest Receivable be included? Typically, quick assets include cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Interest receivable is sometimes included if it's expected to be received quickly, but it's not always. Given that, excluding it gives us 2.11, including it gives ~2.12. The example didn't include it, so sticking with excluding it seems consistent.\n\nThus, final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.14', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.93', 'Quick Ratio': '2.11'} }\n```",
