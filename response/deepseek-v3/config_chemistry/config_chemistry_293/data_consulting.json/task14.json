Here, it is 7,825,951.24.\n   - **Average Accounts Receivable**: This is calculated as the average of the beginning and ending accounts receivable. From the balance sheet:\n     - Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial_amount): 0.00\n     - Ending Accounts Receivable (End_amount): 1,988,616.02\n     - Average Accounts Receivable = (0.00 + 1,988,616.02) / 2 = 994,308.01\n\n2. **Calculate the ratio**:\n   - Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 7,825,951.24 / 994,308.01 â‰ˆ 7.87\n\n3. **Present the solution**:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.87'} }\n```",
