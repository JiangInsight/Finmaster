                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Net Profit Margin\nFirst, I need to recall what the Net Profit Margin is. From what I understand, the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. It's calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us a percentage that represents how much out of every dollar of revenue the company keeps as profit.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 7,825,951.24\n- **Net Profit**: -1,401,436.89\n\n(Note: The Net Profit is negative, which means the company had a loss rather than a profit for this period.)\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\nNow, let's plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,401,436.89}{7,825,951.24} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide the Net Profit by the Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,401,436.89}{7,825,951.24} \\approx -0.1791 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ -0.1791 \\times 100 \\approx -17.91\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nLet me double-check the calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. Divide Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n   - -1,401,436.89 ÷ 7,825,951.24 ≈ -0.1791\n\n2. Convert to percentage:\n   - -0.1791 × 100 = -17.91%\n\nThis seems correct. The negative sign indicates a loss, which aligns with the Net Profit being negative.\n\n### Comparing with the Example\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Net Profit Margin: -30.29%\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,645,141.43}{5,431,018.59} \\approx -0.3029 \\]\n\\[ -0.3029 \\times 100 \\approx -30.29\\% \\]\n\nThis matches the given solution, so my method seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nFor the given problem:\n\n- Net Profit: -1,401,436.89\n- Total Revenue: 7,825,951.24\n- Net Profit Margin: -17.91%\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '-17.91%'}}\n```",
