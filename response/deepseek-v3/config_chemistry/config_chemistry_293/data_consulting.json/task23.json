                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate two key ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**  \nGross Profit Margin is a measure of a company's profitability, showing the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement provided:\n- **Total Revenue (Main Business Revenue):** \\$7,825,951.24\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** \\$6,290,000.00\n- **Gross Profit:** \\$1,535,951.24\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,535,951.24}{7,825,951.24} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{1,535,951.24}{7,825,951.24} \\approx 0.1963 \\]\n\\[ 0.1963 \\times 100 \\approx 19.63\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **19.63%**.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to identify:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** From the cash flow statement, it's -\\$4,398,760.38.\n- **Total Debt:** This is typically the sum of all liabilities. From the balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" we have \\$2,491,297.55. There doesn't seem to be any long-term debt listed, so we'll assume total debt is just the current liabilities.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{2,491,297.55} \\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\\[ \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{2,491,297.55} \\approx -1.765 \\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-1.77**.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the \"Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\" was given as a simple number without a percentage sign, and it was negative, similar to our calculation. So, we'll present it as is.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining both calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '19.63%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: \\$1,535,951.24\n   - Revenue: \\$7,825,951.24\n   - \\$1,535,951.24 / \\$7,825,951.24 = 0.1963 → 19.63% ✔\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -\\$4,398,760.38\n   - Total Debt (Current Liabilities): \\$2,491,297.55\n   - -\\$4,398,760.38 / \\$2,491,297.55 ≈ -1.765 ≈ -1.77 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin Interpretation:** A 19.63% margin means that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about \\$0.1963 after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a healthy margin, indicating good control over production costs relative to sales.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio Interpretation:** A negative ratio (-1.77) indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, meaning it's not generating enough cash from operations to cover its debt. This could be a sign of financial stress, especially if sustained over time. \n\nGiven that both the example and the problem to solve show negative net profits and negative operating cash flows, it seems the company is currently operating at a loss, which is reflected in these ratios.\n\n### Final Json:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '19.63%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```",
