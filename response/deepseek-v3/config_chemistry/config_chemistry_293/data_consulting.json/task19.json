                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Since we only have the ending inventory (no beginning inventory given, assuming it was zero as per the balance sheet), the average inventory is just the ending inventory.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n- **Total Current Assets (End_amount)**: 8,810,936.45\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount)**: 2,491,297.55\n- **Inventory (End_amount)**: 3,540,000.00\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 6,290,000.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{8,810,936.45}{2,491,297.55}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8,810,936.45}{2,491,297.55} \\approx 3.536\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **3.54**.\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Current Ratio was given as '4.27'. Let me double-check if I'm missing something.\n\nLooking back at the example:\n- Total Current Assets: 7,956,806.47\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Current Ratio: 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.27 (matches the given solution)\n\nIn our problem:\n- Total Current Assets: 8,810,936.45\n- Total Current Liabilities: 2,491,297.55\n- 8,810,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ 3.536\n\nSeems correct. Maybe the numbers are different in this problem leading to a different ratio.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{6,290,000.00}{3,540,000.00}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6,290,000}{3,540,000} \\approx 1.777\n\\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **1.78**.\n\nAgain, in the example:\n- COGS: 4,410,000\n- Inventory: 5,090,000\n- Inventory Turnover: 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.866, but given as '1.73'. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe the average inventory is calculated differently. If beginning inventory was 0 and ending is 5,090,000, average is (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000. Then:\n\n4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73 (matches the example)\n\nAh! So I need to calculate average inventory as (beginning + ending) / 2.\n\nIn our problem:\n- Beginning Inventory (Initial_amount): 0.00\n- Ending Inventory (End_amount): 3,540,000.00\n- Average Inventory: (0 + 3,540,000) / 2 = 1,770,000\n\nNow, Inventory Turnover:\n\n6,290,000 / 1,770,000 ≈ 3.553\n\nWait, that seems high compared to the example. Maybe the beginning inventory isn't zero? But in the balance sheet, initial amount for inventory is 0.00.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inventory figures are only the ending ones, and beginning isn't provided, implying no change, but that contradicts the cash flow statement showing an increase.\n\nLooking at cash flow statement:\n\"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\": -3,540,000.00, meaning inventory increased by 3,540,000, so beginning was 0, ending is 3,540,000.\n\nSo average is indeed 1,770,000.\n\nThus, Inventory Turnover: 6,290,000 / 1,770,000 ≈ 3.55\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the example where similar numbers gave 1.73. Maybe the example had higher inventory relative to COGS.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to use ending inventory if beginning is zero, making average inventory half, leading to higher turnover.\n\nGiven that, sticking with:\n\nAverage Inventory: (0 + 3,540,000) / 2 = 1,770,000\nInventory Turnover: 6,290,000 / 1,770,000 ≈ 3.55\n\nBut to match the example's method, it's likely:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning + Ending) / 2\nBeginning Inventory = 0 (from initial balance sheet)\nEnding Inventory = 3,540,000\nAverage = 1,770,000\nTurnover = 6,290,000 / 1,770,000 ≈ 3.55\n\nAlternatively, if the initial inventory isn't zero but not provided, but in the balance sheet initial is zero.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct ratios are:\n\nCurrent Ratio: 3.54\nInventory Turnover: 3.55\n\nBut the example seems to use ending inventory directly for turnover, not average:\n\nExample:\nCOGS: 4,410,000\nInventory: 5,090,000\nTurnover: 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.866, but given as 1.73, which is 4,410,000 / (5,090,000 / 2) or 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nSo average is used.\n\nSimilarly here:\n\nAverage Inventory: 1,770,000\nTurnover: 6,290,000 / 1,770,000 ≈ 3.55\n\nBut this seems high. Maybe COGS is for a longer period, but dates are same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe initial inventory isn't zero, but balance sheet shows initial amount for inventory is 0.00.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct ratios are:\n\nCurrent Ratio: 8,810,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ 3.54\nInventory Turnover: 6,290,000 / ((0 + 3,540,000)/2) = 6,290,000 / 1,770,000 ≈ 3.55\n\nBut to match the example's presentation (rounded to two decimal places):\n\nCurrent Ratio: 3.54\nInventory Turnover: 3.55\n\nBut the example had Current Ratio as '4.27' (no rounding to two decimals), and Inventory Turnover as '1.73'.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the ratios are presented as calculated without rounding intermediate steps.\n\nLet me calculate with more precision:\n\nCurrent Ratio:\n8,810,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 = 3.5366... ≈ 3.54\n\nInventory Turnover:\n6,290,000 / 1,770,000 = 3.5536... ≈ 3.55\n\nBut the example's Inventory Turnover was '1.73' with similar numbers, suggesting maybe a different approach.\n\nWait, in the example:\n\nCOGS: 4,410,000\nInventory: 5,090,000\nAverage Inventory: (assuming beginning was zero) 2,545,000\nTurnover: 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nSimilarly here:\n\nCOGS: 6,290,000\nAverage Inventory: 1,770,000\nTurnover: 6,290,000 / 1,770,000 ≈ 3.55\n\nSo the method seems consistent, just different numbers leading to different ratios.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nAfter careful consideration, the correct calculations are:\n\n1. **Current Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8,810,936.45}{2,491,297.55} \\approx 3.54\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places: **3.54**\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**:\n   - Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (0 + 3,540,000) / 2 = 1,770,000\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6,290,000}{1,770,000} \\approx 3.55\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places: **3.55**\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the Inventory Turnover was calculated as COGS / Average Inventory, where Average Inventory was (Beginning + Ending)/2, even if Beginning was zero. So the method is correct, just the numbers differ.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.54', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.55'} }\n```\n\nBut the example had ratios like '4.27' and '1.73', which are to two decimal places without rounding issues, suggesting that perhaps the ratios are presented as calculated without rounding numerator and denominator separately.\n\nLet me compute with full precision:\n\nCurrent Ratio:\nNumerator: 8810936.45\nDenominator: 2491297.55\n8810936.45 / 2491297.55 ≈ 3.5366 → '3.54'\n\nInventory Turnover:\nNumerator: 6290000.00\nDenominator: 1770000.00\n6290000 / 1770000 ≈ 3.5536 → '3.55'\n\nGiven that, the correct json is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.54', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.55'} }\n```\n\n*But* the example had '1.73' for Inventory Turnover with COGS=4,410,000 and Inventory=5,090,000, implying:\n\n4,410,000 / ((0 + 5,090,000)/2) = 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.7328 → '1.73'\n\nSimilarly here:\n\n6,290,000 / ((0 + 3,540,000)/2) = 6,290,000 / 1,770,000 ≈ 3.5536 → '3.55'\n\nSo the method is consistent, just different numbers.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.54', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.55'} }\n```",
