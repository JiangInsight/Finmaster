                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 2,491,297.55\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so total liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 11,598,563.11\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{2,491,297.55}{11,598,563.11} \\approx 0.2148 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.21\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** -1,401,436.89\n- **Total Revenue:** 7,825,951.24\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,401,436.89}{7,825,951.24} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx -17.91\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSince we don't have the beginning total assets for the period (only initial and end amounts which seem to be the same), we'll use the ending total assets for simplicity (assuming beginning is the initial amount and end is the end amount, but they seem to be the same in the given data). Alternatively, if we consider the initial and end amounts from the balance sheet:\n\nInitial Total Assets: 13,000,000.00\nEnd Total Assets: 14,089,860.66\n\nAverage Total Assets = (Initial + End) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 14,089,860.66) / 2 = 13,544,930.33\n\nNet Profit: -1,401,436.89\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{-1,401,436.89}{13,544,930.33} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx -10.35\\% \\]\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects receivables from customers. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no cash sales are mentioned), we'll use Total Revenue for Net Credit Sales.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Total Revenue (Net Credit Sales):** 7,825,951.24\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable: 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable: 1,988,616.02\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (Initial + End) / 2 = (0 + 1,988,616.02) / 2 = 994,308.01\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{7,825,951.24}{994,308.01} \\approx 7.87 \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Net Profit Margin': '-17.91%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-10.35%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.87'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 2,491,297.55\n   - Equity: 11,598,563.11\n   - 2,491,297.55 / 11,598,563.11 ≈ 0.2148 → 0.21 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: -1,401,436.89\n   - Revenue: 7,825,951.24\n   - (-1,401,436.89 / 7,825,951.24) * 100 ≈ -17.91% ✔\n\n3. **ROA:**\n   - Net Profit: -1,401,436.89\n   - Average Assets: (13,000,000 + 14,089,860.66) / 2 = 13,544,930.33\n   - (-1,401,436.89 / 13,544,930.33) * 100 ≈ -10.35% ✔\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover:**\n   - Revenue: 7,825,951.24\n   - Avg AR: (0 + 1,988,616.02) / 2 = 994,308.01\n   - 7,825,951.24 / 994,308.01 ≈ 7.87 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The final answer is correct.",
