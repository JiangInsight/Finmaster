However, since financing activities are not provided here, we can use the Net Increase directly.\n\n2. **Identify the Given Values**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,398,760.38\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -324,677.57 (which includes Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n   - Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: -4,723,437.95\n\n3. **Calculate FCF**:\n   - Since the Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents already accounts for both operating and investing activities, we can directly use this value as the FCF.\n   - Therefore, FCF = Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents = -4,723,437.95.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The Free Cash Flow (FCF) is -4,723,437.95.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-4723437.95'} }\n```",
