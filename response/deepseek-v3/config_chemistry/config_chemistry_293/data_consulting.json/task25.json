                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThe Debt to Equity Ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,598,563.11\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{2,491,297.55}{11,598,563.11} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{2,491,297.55}{11,598,563.11} \\approx 0.2148 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx 0.21 \\]\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**  \nThe Net Profit Margin shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Net Profit = -1,401,436.89\n- Total Revenue = 7,825,951.24\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,401,436.89}{7,825,951.24} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\\[ \\frac{-1,401,436.89}{7,825,951.24} \\approx -0.1791 \\]\n\nThen multiply by 100:\n\\[ -0.1791 \\times 100 \\approx -17.91\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThis ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,398,760.38\n- From the Balance Sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{2,491,297.55} \\]\n\nDivide:\n\\[ \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{2,491,297.55} \\approx -1.7657 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx -1.77 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Net Profit Margin': '-17.91%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 2,491,297.55\n   - Equity: 11,598,563.11\n   - 2,491,297.55 / 11,598,563.11 ≈ 0.2148 → 0.21 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: -1,401,436.89\n   - Revenue: 7,825,951.24\n   - (-1,401,436.89 / 7,825,951.24) * 100 ≈ -17.91% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -4,398,760.38\n   - Current Liabilities: 2,491,297.55\n   - -4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ -1.7657 → -1.77 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The final JSON is correct.",
