                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the **Gross Profit Margin** and the **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n   \n   **Formula**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It indicates short-term liquidity.\n   \n   **Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$7,825,951.24\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): \\$6,290,000.00\n- Gross Profit: \\$1,535,951.24\n\nFrom the **cash flow statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$4,398,760.38\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$2,491,297.55\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nLet's plug the numbers into the Gross Profit Margin formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,535,951.24}{7,825,951.24} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFirst, divide Gross Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1,535,951.24}{7,825,951.24} \\approx 0.1963\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.1963 \\times 100 \\approx 19.63\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **19.63%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nNow, let's calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{2,491,297.55}\n\\]\n\nDivide the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities by Total Current Liabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-4,398,760.38}{2,491,297.55} \\approx -1.765\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **-1.77**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: \\$1,535,951.24\n   - Total Revenue: \\$7,825,951.24\n   - \\$1,535,951.24 / \\$7,825,951.24 ≈ 0.1963 → 19.63%\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$4,398,760.38\n   - Total Current Liabilities: \\$2,491,297.55\n   - -\\$4,398,760.38 / \\$2,491,297.55 ≈ -1.765\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '19.63%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin**: A 19.63% margin means that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about \\$0.1963 after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This seems reasonable, but it's always good to compare with industry averages.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: A negative ratio (-1.77) indicates that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities. This could be a sign of financial stress, as the company is spending more cash on operations than it's bringing in, relative to its short-term obligations. \n\nIn the example provided in the task, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio was also negative (-3.90), which suggests that negative ratios might be expected in this context, possibly due to significant investments or other one-time expenses affecting cash flow. However, consistently negative ratios could be a red flag for the company's financial health.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the calculations in more detail?",
