                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount): 8,810,936.45\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 2,491,297.55\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 8,810,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ 3.54\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand: 1,753,673.43\n- Bank Deposits: 1,522,888.62\n- Interest Receivable: 5,758.38\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,988,616.02\n- Current Liabilities: 2,491,297.55\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 + 5,758.38 + 1,988,616.02 ≈ 5,270,936.45\n\nQuick Ratio = 5,270,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ 2.12\n\n*Note:* Sometimes, Interest Receivable might not be included in quick assets, but since it's a short-term receivable, I'm including it here. If excluded, Quick Assets would be ~5,265,178.07, and Quick Ratio ≈ 2.11, which is very close.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Debt / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities: Here, it seems only Current Liabilities are present (2,491,297.55), as there's no mention of long-term debt.\n- Total Assets: 14,089,860.66\n\nAssuming no long-term debt, Total Debt = Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 2,491,297.55 / 14,089,860.66 ≈ 0.18\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Owner's Equity: 11,598,563.11\n- Total Debt: 2,491,297.55 (as above)\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 2,491,297.55 / 11,598,563.11 ≈ 0.21\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,398,760.38\n- Total Debt: 2,491,297.55 (as above)\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55 ≈ -1.77\n\n*Note:* A negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, which isn't favorable for covering its debt.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.54', 'Quick Ratio': '2.12', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.18', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me quickly verify the numbers to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Current Ratio:**\n   - 8,810,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 = 3.536 (≈3.54) ✅\n\n2. **Quick Ratio:**\n   - Quick Assets: 1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 + 5,758.38 + 1,988,616.02 = 5,270,936.45\n   - 5,270,936.45 / 2,491,297.55 = 2.115 (≈2.12) ✅\n\n3. **Debt to Asset:**\n   - 2,491,297.55 / 14,089,860.66 = 0.1768 (≈0.18) ✅\n\n4. **Debt to Equity:**\n   - 2,491,297.55 / 11,598,563.11 = 0.2148 (≈0.21) ✅\n\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt:**\n   - -4,398,760.38 / 2,491,297.55 = -1.765 (≈-1.77) ✅\n\nEverything checks out!",
