                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio to understand how to compute them based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 2,491,297.55\n- **Total Non-current Liabilities:** Not provided explicitly, but looking at the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are under \"Total Current Liabilities.\" There's no separate line for long-term debt or non-current liabilities. \n  \n  - **Paid-in Capital** and **Retained Earnings** are part of Owner's Equity, not liabilities.\n  - **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity (End_amount):** 14,089,860.66\n  - **Total Owner's Equity (End_amount):** 11,598,563.11\n  \n  Therefore, Total Liabilities can be calculated as:\n  \n  \\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity} - \\text{Total Owner's Equity} \\]\n  \n  \\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = 14,089,860.66 - 11,598,563.11 = 2,491,297.55 \\]\n  \n  This matches the \"Total Current Liabilities,\" implying there are no non-current liabilities.\n\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 14,089,860.66\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{2,491,297.55}{14,089,860.66} \\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2,491,297.55}{14,089,860.66} \\approx 0.1768 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.18\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income, indicating how much cash the company generates relative to its reported earnings. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -4,398,760.38\n- **Net Profit (Net Income):** -1,401,436.89 (from the income statement)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{-1,401,436.89} \\]\n\nNegative divided by negative is positive:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,398,760.38}{1,401,436.89} \\approx 3.139 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 3.14\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n- Total Liabilities: 2,491,297.55\n- Total Assets: 14,089,860.66\n- Ratio: 2,491,297.55 / 14,089,860.66 ≈ 0.1768 → 0.18\n\n**Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**\n- Operating Cash Flow: -4,398,760.38\n- Net Income: -1,401,436.89\n- Ratio: 4,398,760.38 / 1,401,436.89 ≈ 3.139 → 3.14\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.18', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.14'} }\n```",
