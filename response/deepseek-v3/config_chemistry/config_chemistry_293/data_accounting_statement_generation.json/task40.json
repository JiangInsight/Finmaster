This is done by analyzing the purchases and sales transactions to see how much inventory was added and how much was sold.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Purchase Transactions (Inventory Added):**\n   - Look for all transactions where the type is \"Purchase\" and sum their amounts.\n   - From the given data:\n     - Purchase20231231001: 280,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231002: 500,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231003: 300,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231004: 2,900,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231005: 1,050,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231006: 220,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231007: 100,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231008: 1,800,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231009: 800,000.00 (Unpaid, but still part of inventory)\n     - Purchase20231231010: 320,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231011: 260,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231012: 1,300,000.00 (Unpaid, but still part of inventory)\n   - Total Purchases = 280,000 + 500,000 + 300,000 + 2,900,000 + 1,050,000 + 220,000 + 100,000 + 1,800,000 + 800,000 + 320,000 + 260,000 + 1,300,000 = 9,430,000.00\n\n2. **Identify Sales Transactions (Inventory Sold):**\n   - Look for all transactions where the type is \"Sale\" and sum their cost amounts (cost_per_unit * quantity).\n   - From the given data:\n     - Sale20240102002: 10,000 * 1 = 10,000.00\n     - Sale20240102003: 10,000 * 3 = 30,000.00\n     - Sale20240103004: 20,000 * 4 = 80,000.00\n     - Sale20240104005: 10,000 * 5 = 50,000.00\n     - Sale20240105007: 20,000 * 4 = 80,000.00\n     - Sale20240106009: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.00\n     - Sale20240106010: 50,000 * 2 = 100,000.00\n     - Sale20240107011: 100,000 * 5 = 500,000.00\n     - Sale20240108013: 100,000 * 2 = 200,000.00\n     - Sale20240110015: 10,000 * 3 = 30,000.00\n     - Sale20240110016: 100,000 * 4 = 400,000.00\n     - Sale20240111017: 50,000 * 1 = 50,000.00\n     - Sale20240111018: 50,000 * 2 = 100,000.00\n     - Sale20240112020: 100,000 * 5 = 500,000.00\n     - Sale20240112021: 10,000 * 2 = 20,000.00\n     - Sale20240113023: 20,000 * 2 = 40,000.00\n     - Sale20240113024: 10,000 * 2 = 20,000.00\n     - Sale20240114027: 100,000 * 5 = 500,000.00\n     - Sale20240115029: 20,000 * 2 = 40,000.00\n     - Sale20240116031: 10,000 * 5 = 50,000.00\n     - Sale20240116032: 50,000 * 4 = 200,000.00\n     - Sale20240117034: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.00\n     - Sale20240117035: 50,000 * 4 = 200,000.00\n     - Sale20240118038: 10,000 * 4 = 40,000.00\n     - Sale20240118039: 20,000 * 4 = 80,000.00\n     - Sale20240119041: 50,000 * 2 = 100,000.00\n     - Sale20240120043: 20,000 * 2 = 40,000.00\n     - Sale20240121047: 100,000 * 5 = 500,000.00\n     - Sale20240121048: 20,000 * 2 = 40,000.00\n     - Sale20240122050: 100,000 * 3 = 300,000.00\n     - Sale20240122051: 50,000 * 4 = 200,000.00\n     - Sale20240123052: 10,000 * 4 = 40,000.00\n     - Sale20240124053: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.00\n     - Sale20240124054: 100,000 * 1 = 100,000.00\n     - Sale20240125055: 50,000 * 2 = 100,000.00\n     - Sale20240125056: 100,000 * 4 = 400,000.00\n     - Sale20240126059: 10,000 * 3 = 30,000.00\n     - Sale20240126060: 50,000 * 2 = 100,000.00\n     - Sale20240127062: 100,000 * 5 = 500,000.00\n     - Sale20240127063: 10,000 * 5 = 50,000.00\n     - Sale20240128065: 10,000 * 5 = 50,000.00\n     - Sale20240129067: 50,000 * 3 = 150,000.00\n     - Sale20240130068: 20,000 * 2 = 40,000.00\n     - Sale20240130069: 10,000 * 5 = 50,000.00\n   - Total Cost of Goods Sold = Sum of all cost amounts = 6,730,000.00\n\n3. **Calculate Change in Inventory:**\n   - Change in Inventory = Total Purchases - Total Cost of Goods Sold\n   - Change in Inventory = 9,430,000.00 - 6,730,000.00 = 2,700,000.00\n   - Since inventory increased, this is a negative cash flow (cash outflow). Thus, it is represented as a decrease in the cash flow statement.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" is -2,700,000.00 (negative because inventory increased, implying cash outflow).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-2700000.00'}}\n```",
