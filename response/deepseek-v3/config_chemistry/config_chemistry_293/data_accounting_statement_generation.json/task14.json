Current liabilities typically include items such as accounts payable (unpaid purchases) and other short-term obligations. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Current Liabilities:**\n   - The initial current liabilities would be any unpaid amounts from transactions dated on or before the start date (2023-12-31).\n   - From the given data, there are no unpaid transactions on or before 2023-12-31. All purchases on this date are marked as \"Paid\" except for one:\n     - `Purchase20231231007`: This is marked as \"Unpaid\" with an amount of 800,000.00 (payment method: Account Payable).\n   - Therefore, the initial current liabilities are 800,000.00.\n\n2. **Identify Final Current Liabilities:**\n   - The final current liabilities include any unpaid amounts from transactions dated on or before the end date (2024-01-30).\n   - From the data, the unpaid purchases are:\n     - `Purchase20231231007`: 800,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable).\n     - `Purchase20231231012`: 1,300,000.00 (Unpaid, Account Payable).\n   - Additionally, there are unpaid interest receivables, but these are assets, not liabilities, so we exclude them.\n   - Total final current liabilities = 800,000.00 + 1,300,000.00 = 2,100,000.00.\n\n3. **Format the Solution:**\n   - The initial current liabilities are 800,000.00.\n   - The final current liabilities are 2,100,000.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '800000.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '2100000.00'} }\n```",
