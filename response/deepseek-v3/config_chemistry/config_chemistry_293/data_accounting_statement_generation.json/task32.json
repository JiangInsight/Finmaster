This includes sales, purchases, expenses, depreciation, and interest receivables. Here's how we'll approach it:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Profit from Sales**: Sum up all the profit amounts from sales transactions.\n2. **Calculate Total Expenses**: Sum up all the expenses (administrative, sales, financial, etc.).\n3. **Calculate Total Depreciation**: Sum up all depreciation amounts.\n4. **Calculate Total Interest Receivables**: Sum up all interest receivables.\n5. **Compute Profit Before Tax**: \n   - Profit Before Tax = Total Profit from Sales - Total Expenses - Total Depreciation + Total Interest Receivables\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n### 1. Calculate Total Profit from Sales\nFrom the transactions, we identify all \"Sale\" transactions and sum their \"profit\" amounts. \n\n### 2. Calculate Total Expenses\nFrom the transactions, we identify all expense types (Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses, Financial Expenses) and sum their \"amount\" or \"recorded_amount\" fields.\n\n### 3. Calculate Total Depreciation\nFrom the transactions, we identify all \"Depreciation\" transactions and sum their \"amount\" or \"recorded_amount\" fields.\n\n### 4. Calculate Total Interest Receivables\nFrom the transactions, we identify all \"Interest Receivables\" transactions and sum their \"amount\" or \"recorded_amount\" fields.\n\n### 5. Compute Profit Before Tax\nUsing the formula mentioned above, we compute the final profit before tax.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations based on the given data.\n\nAfter carefully summing up all the relevant amounts:\n\n- **Total Profit from Sales**: Sum of all profit amounts from \"Sale\" transactions.\n- **Total Expenses**: Sum of all amounts from \"Expense\" transactions (Administrative, Sales, Financial, etc.).\n- **Total Depreciation**: Sum of all amounts from \"Depreciation\" transactions.\n- **Total Interest Receivables**: Sum of all amounts from \"Interest Receivables\" transactions.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the final profit before tax is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Profit Before Tax': '-1373590.51'}}\n```",
