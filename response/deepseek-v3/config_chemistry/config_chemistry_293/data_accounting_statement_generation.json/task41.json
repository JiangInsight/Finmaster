These transactions represent the amounts that have not yet been paid to suppliers and thus contribute to the accounts payable balance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Purchase Transactions with Account Payable:**\n   - From the given data, we look for transactions where:\n     - `type` is \"Purchase\"\n     - `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\"\n     - `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\"\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Transactions:**\n   - The only transaction that meets these criteria is:\n     - `Purchase20231231012`: \n       - `amount`: 1,300,000.0\n       - `payment/receipt_status`: Unpaid\n       - `payment_method`: Account Payable\n\n3. **Calculate Total Accounts Payable:**\n   - Since there is only one such transaction, the total accounts payable is the amount of this transaction: 1,300,000.0.\n\n4. **Format the Result:**\n   - The result should be presented as a positive number since it represents an increase in accounts payable (liability).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '1300000.00'}}\n```",
