Depreciation is a non-cash expense that reduces the value of fixed assets over time and is typically recorded as an expense in the financial statements.\n\n2. **Review the Transactions Data**: We need to look through the transactions data for any entry where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\".\n\n3. **Locate the Depreciation Entry**: \n   - In the provided data, there is an entry with `id = \"Depreciation20240101001\"` and `type = \"Depreciation\"`.\n   - The `amount` and `recorded_amount` for this entry are both `45753.36`.\n\n4. **Verify the Entry**: \n   - The entry has no approver or preparer, which is typical for depreciation entries as they are usually system-generated.\n   - The date of the transaction is `2024-01-01`, which is within the period covered by the data.\n\n5. **Extract the Depreciation Amount**: The amount to be reported is `45753.36`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45753.36'} }\n```",
