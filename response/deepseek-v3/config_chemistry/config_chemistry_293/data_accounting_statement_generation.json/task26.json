Depreciation is typically recorded as an expense in the income statement, and we can find it by looking for transactions where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Data Structure**: The data is presented in a tabular format with columns like \"id\", \"type\", \"date\", \"amount\", etc. We are interested in rows where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\".\n\n2. **Locate the Depreciation Entry**: Scan through the \"type\" column to find the row(s) where the type is \"Depreciation\". \n\n3. **Extract the Depreciation Amount**: Once the depreciation entry is found, note the \"amount\" or \"recorded_amount\" associated with it. \n\n4. **Verify the Date**: Ensure that the depreciation entry is for the correct period (in this case, it should be for the year 2024, as the task is about the income statement for that period).\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: Present the depreciation amount in the required JSON format.\n\n### Applying to the Given Problem:\n\nLooking at the provided data, we find the following entry:\n- **id**: Depreciation20240101001\n- **type**: Depreciation\n- **date**: 2024-01-01\n- **amount**: 45753.36\n- **recorded_amount**: 45753.36\n\nThis is the only depreciation entry in the data, and it is for the correct period (2024). \n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45753.36'} }\n```",
