Accounts payable represents the amount a company owes to its suppliers for purchases made on credit. \n\n### Steps to Calculate Accounts Payable:\n1. **Identify Initial Accounts Payable**: \n   - The initial accounts payable is the sum of all unpaid purchase transactions at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31).\n   - From the given data, we look for transactions where `type` is \"Purchase\" and `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" or the payment method is \"Account Payable\".\n\n2. **Identify Final Accounts Payable**:\n   - The final accounts payable is the sum of all unpaid purchase transactions at the end of the period (2024-01-30).\n   - Similarly, we look for transactions where `type` is \"Purchase\" and `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" or the payment method is \"Account Payable\".\n\n### Analysis of the Given Data:\n- **Initial Accounts Payable**:\n  - There are no unpaid purchase transactions on 2023-12-31 in the given data. All purchases on this date are marked as \"Paid\" or do not specify \"Unpaid\" or \"Account Payable\". Thus, the initial accounts payable is 0.00.\n\n- **Final Accounts Payable**:\n  - There are two unpaid purchase transactions on 2023-12-31:\n    1. `Purchase20231231007`: Amount = 800,000.00, `payment/receipt_status` = \"Unpaid\", `payment_method` = \"Account Payable\".\n    2. `Purchase20231231012`: Amount = 1,300,000.00, `payment/receipt_status` = \"Unpaid\", `payment_method` = \"Account Payable\".\n  - The total final accounts payable is 800,000.00 + 1,300,000.00 = 2,100,000.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Accounts Payable Initial Value\": \"0.00\", \"Accounts Payable End Value\": \"2100000.00\"}}\n```",
