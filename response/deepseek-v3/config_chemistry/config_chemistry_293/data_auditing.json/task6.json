First, I notice there are multiple entries with the same transaction ID \"Initial20231231001\" but different types (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) and amounts. This appears to be a duplicate entry issue.\n\n2. Looking at transaction \"Sale20240108013\":\n   - The invoice description mentions a unit price of $133,655.83\n   - But the recorded unit price is $149,637.03\n   - The calculated amount (2 units Ã— $133,655.83 = $267,311.66) matches the recorded amount\n   - Therefore, the recorded unit price is incorrect\n\n3. The risk_issues field for this transaction confirms there's a discrepancy between original and recorded prices.\n\n4. For the solution:\n   - Only the unit price field has an inconsistency\n   - All other fields appear correct\n   - The correct unit price should be $133,655.83 as per the invoice description\n\nHere's the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": null,\n    \"Recorded category\": null,\n    \"Original date\": null,\n    \"Recorded date\": null,\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n    \"Original price\": \"133655.83\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"149637.03\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": null,\n    \"Recorded amount\": null,\n    \"Original tax\": null,\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240108013\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe inconsistency is specifically in the unit price field where the recorded value doesn't match the original value from the invoice description. All other fields are consistent with the transaction details.",
