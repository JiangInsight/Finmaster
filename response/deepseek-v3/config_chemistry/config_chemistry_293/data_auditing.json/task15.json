Looking at transaction \"Sale20240105007\":\n- The recorded type is \"Sales Expenses\" but the invoice description clearly states it's a \"Sale\"\n- The recorded quantity is 3.0 but the invoice states 4.0 units\n- The recorded amount is $72,578.16 but based on 4 units at $24,192.72 each, it should be $96,770.88\n\n2. The invoice description provides the correct details that contradict the recorded fields.\n\nHere's the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sales Expenses\",\n    \"Original date\": null,\n    \"Recorded date\": null,\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": \"4.0\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"3.0\",\n    \"Original price\": \"24192.72\",\n    \"Recorded price\": null,\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": \"96770.88\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"72578.16\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"4838.54\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": null,\n    \"Original profit\": \"16770.88\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240105007\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe key inconsistencies are:\n1. Incorrect transaction type (Sale vs Sales Expenses)\n2. Incorrect quantity recorded (3 vs 4 units)\n3. Incorrect amount recorded ($72,578.16 vs $96,770.88)\n\nThe invoice description provides the correct values which I've used to populate the \"Original\" fields in the solution.",
