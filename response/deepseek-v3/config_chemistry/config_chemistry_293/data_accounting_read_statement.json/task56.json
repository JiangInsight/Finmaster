This is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n\n2. **Locating Depreciation in Financial Statements**:\n   - **Balance Sheet**: The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item shows the total depreciation accumulated over time. Here, it is listed as \"45753.36\" under the \"End_amount\" column.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" also shows \"45753.36\".\n   - **Income Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item under expenses is listed as \"45753.36\".\n\n3. **Consistency Across Statements**: The value \"45753.36\" is consistent across all three financial statements (Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, and Income Statement), confirming it as the correct value for depreciation.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The value extracted for depreciation is \"45753.36\".",
