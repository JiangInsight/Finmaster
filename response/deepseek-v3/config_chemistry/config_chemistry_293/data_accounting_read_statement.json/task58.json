This matches the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" from the balance sheet (3000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 8000000.00).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is 8000000.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
