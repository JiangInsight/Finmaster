The key line item to look for is \"Total Owner's Equity,\" which represents the total equity recognized in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Owner's Equity\" is present, which is the sum of \"Paid-in Capital\" and \"Retained Earnings.\"\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Owner's Equity\" is `13000000.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Owner's Equity\" is `11598563.11` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-30`.\n\n4. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value of equity is consistent with the \"Paid-in Capital\" at the start (`13000000.00`) since \"Retained Earnings\" was `0.00`.\n   - The end value of equity is the sum of \"Paid-in Capital\" (`13000000.00`) and \"Retained Earnings\" (`-1401436.89`), which equals `11598563.11`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '11598563.11'} }\n```",
