In the given problem, it is listed as \"Total Revenue\" with an amount of \"7825951.24\".\n   - **Total Cost**: This is the total cost associated with generating the revenue. In the given problem, it is listed as \"Total Cost\" with an amount of \"6290000.00\".\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference Between Revenue and Cost**:\n   - The difference between revenue and cost is typically referred to as \"Gross Profit\" in an income statement. This is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross Profit} = 7825951.24 - 6290000.00 = 1535951.24\n     \\]\n\n3. **Verify the Line Item in the Income Statement**:\n   - The income statement provided includes a line item labeled \"Gross Profit\" with the amount \"1535951.24\", which matches our calculation. This confirms that the difference between revenue and cost is indeed the \"Gross Profit\".\n\n4. **Extract the Value**:\n   - The value to be extracted is the amount associated with \"Gross Profit\", which is \"1535951.24\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1535951.24'}}\n```",
