This is typically listed under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section of the statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided problem, the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section is clearly marked. Under this section, there are three line items:\n   - \"Beginning Balance\"\n   - \"Ending Balance\"\n   - \"Net Increase\"\n\n3. **Identify the \"Beginning Balance\"**: The \"Beginning Balance\" represents the cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period. In the given problem, the \"Beginning Balance\" is listed as `8000000.00`.\n\n4. **Verify the Date**: The date for all entries is `2024-01-30`, which confirms that this is the correct period for the beginning balance.\n\n5. **Extract the Value**: The value to be extracted is `8000000.00`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
