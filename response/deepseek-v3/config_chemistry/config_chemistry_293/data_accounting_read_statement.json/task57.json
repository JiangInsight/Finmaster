This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is recorded under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet and cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Check the Balance Sheet**:\n   - In the balance sheet provided, the \"Accounts Payable\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00\n     - End_amount: 2100000.00\n   - This indicates an increase of 2,100,000.00 in accounts payable during the period.\n\n3. **Verify with Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, under \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\", the amount is 2100000.00, which matches the increase seen in the balance sheet.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 2,100,000.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2100000.00'}}\n```",
