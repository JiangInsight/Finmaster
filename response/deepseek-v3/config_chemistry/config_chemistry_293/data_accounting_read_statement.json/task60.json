Since we only need values from the Balance Sheet and Income Statement, we can ignore the Cash Flow Statement for this task.\n   - Within each group, maintain the original line item order as shown in the input statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1522888.62', 'value2': '5758.38'} }\n```",
