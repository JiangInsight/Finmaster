                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific pieces of information from the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This typically refers to the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" because accounts payable represent amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n   \n2. **Acquisition of property, plant and equipment**: This is usually listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement.\n   \n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: This is the \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Cash Flow Statement\nLet's look at the given cash flow statement and locate these items.\n\n#### 1. Increase in Accounts Payable\nLooking under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, we see:\n- Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 2100000.00\n\nThis is the amount by which the entity's accounts payable have increased during the period, indicating more goods or services were purchased on credit.\n\n#### 2. Purchase of Fixed Assets\nUnder the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section, we find:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 324677.57\n\nThis represents the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment during the period.\n\n#### 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents at Beginning of Period\nUnder the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, we see:\n- Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n\nThis is the cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe task mentions maintaining the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the example provided:\n\n- The first value was \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n- The second was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n- The third was \"Beginning Balance\".\n\nThis order matches how these items appear in the statement from top to bottom.\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling the values in the required order:\n\n1. Increase in Accounts Payable: 2100000.00\n2. Purchase of Fixed Assets: 324677.57\n3. Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n\nPutting this into the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2100000.00', 'value2': '324677.57', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```\n\n### Double-Checking\nJust to ensure I didn't miss anything:\n\n- **value1**: Correctly identified as the increase in accounts payable.\n- **value2**: Correctly identified as the purchase of fixed assets.\n- **value3**: Correctly identified as the beginning cash balance.\n\nAll values are in the correct order as they appear in the statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully reviewing the cash flow statement and identifying the relevant line items, the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2100000.00', 'value2': '324677.57', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
