In an income statement, this is typically labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided income statement, we look for the line item labeled \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n3. **Extract the Value**: Once located, we note the corresponding amount listed under the \"Amount\" column for \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n4. **Verify**: Ensure that the line item is indeed the cost associated with the inventories sold, which is confirmed by its standard accounting definition.\n\n### Application to the Given Problem:\n- In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" has an amount of `6290000.00`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6290000.00'}}\n```",
