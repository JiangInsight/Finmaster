In the given problem, we can see a line item labeled \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of \"391297.55\".\n3. **Verify the Context**: Ensure that the \"Tax Expense\" line item is indeed the total tax for the reporting period. In this case, it appears right after \"Profit Before Tax\" and before \"Net Profit\", which is the standard placement for tax expenses in an income statement.\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Tax Expense\" is \"391297.55\", which represents the total tax expected to be paid or recovered during the reporting period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '391297.55'} }\n```",
