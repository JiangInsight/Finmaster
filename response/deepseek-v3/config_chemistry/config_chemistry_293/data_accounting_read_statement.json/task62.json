The end value is the amount owed at the end of the period.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is typically found in the **Income Statement** under \"Financial Expenses\". The amount listed here represents the financing costs.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is typically found in the **Cash Flow Statement** under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\". The amount listed here represents the cash outflow for such purchases.\n\nLet's extract these values step by step from the given financial statements.\n\n### Step 1: Extract \"Accounts Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet\n- In the Balance Sheet, look for the line item \"Accounts Receivable\".\n- The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is `1988616.02`.\n\n### Step 2: Extract \"Financial Expenses\" from the Income Statement\n- In the Income Statement, look for the line item \"Financial Expenses\".\n- The \"Amount\" for \"Financial Expenses\" is `543212.45`.\n\n### Step 3: Extract \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" from the Cash Flow Statement\n- In the Cash Flow Statement, look for the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n- The \"Amount\" for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `324677.57`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1988616.02', 'value2': '543212.45', 'value3': '324677.57'}}\n```",
