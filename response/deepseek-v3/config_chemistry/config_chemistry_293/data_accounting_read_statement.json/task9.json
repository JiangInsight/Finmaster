The relevant line item is \"Taxes Payable,\" which represents the taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: Look for the account labeled \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet. This account shows the amount of taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The \"Initial_amount\" column under \"Taxes Payable\" shows the value at the beginning of the period (initial value). In this case, it is `0.00`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**: The \"End_amount\" column under \"Taxes Payable\" shows the value at the end of the period (end value). In this case, it is `391297.55`.\n\n4. **Format the Solution**: Present the extracted values in the required JSON format.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '391297.55'} }\n```",
