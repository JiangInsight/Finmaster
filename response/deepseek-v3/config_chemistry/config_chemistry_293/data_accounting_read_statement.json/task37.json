This line item is typically labeled as \"Depreciation\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the depreciation value in the cash flow statement. Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n\n2. **Locate the Depreciation Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item labeled \"Depreciation\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: Once the \"Depreciation\" line item is found, note the corresponding amount.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: Ensure that the line item is indeed under the operating activities section and is not confused with other similar terms like \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" (which is under investing activities).\n\n### Application to the Given Problem:\n\n- In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Depreciation\" line item is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" with an amount of \"45753.36\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45753.36'} }\n```",
