These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets, intangible assets, and long-term investments.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually one year). In the given balance sheet, the non-current assets are represented by \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which are summed up under \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is given under \"Total Non-current Assets\" with the \"Initial_amount\" of \"5000000.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" \"2023-12-31.\"\n   - The end value of non-current assets is given under \"Total Non-current Assets\" with the \"End_amount\" of \"5278924.21\" as of the \"End_date\" \"2024-01-30.\"\n\n3. **Verify the Line Items**:\n   - The line items under non-current assets are \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which are correctly categorized as non-current assets. The \"Total Non-current Assets\" is the sum of these items after accounting for depreciation.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is \"5000000.00.\"\n   - The end value of non-current assets is \"5278924.21.\"\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5278924.21'} }\n```",
