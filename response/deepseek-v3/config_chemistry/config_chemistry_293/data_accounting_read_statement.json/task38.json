                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify the specific line item in the cash flow statement that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" line item, as it shows the change in the amounts owed by customers (accounts receivable) during the period.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the value that represents the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit. This is directly related to the change in accounts receivable.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: In the cash flow statement provided, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" captures this information. A negative value here indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., more amounts are owed to the entity), while a positive value would indicate a decrease (i.e., less amounts are owed to the entity).\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: From the given cash flow statement, the value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is \"-1988616.02\". This negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable, meaning the amounts owed to the entity have increased during the period. However, the task asks for the \"decrease\" in amounts owed, so if the value were positive, it would represent a decrease. Since the value is negative, it means there was no decrease but rather an increase. But based on the example provided, the task expects the value of the line item regardless of its sign.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The value to be extracted is \"-1988616.02\".\n\nHere is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1988616.02'}}\n```",
