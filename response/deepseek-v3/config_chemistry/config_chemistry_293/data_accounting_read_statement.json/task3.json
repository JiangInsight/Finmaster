This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are to find the line item that shows money owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit. This is \"Accounts Receivable\" in accounting terms.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given balance sheet, look for the row labeled \"Accounts Receivable\".\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**: \n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is the value at the \"Initial_date\".\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Receivable\" is the value at the \"End_date\".\n4. **Verify the Data**: \n   - In the provided problem, \"Accounts Receivable\" has:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (Initial_date: 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 1988616.02 (End_date: 2024-01-30)\n\n### Solution:\nThe initial and end values for \"Accounts Receivable\" are correctly identified as 0.00 and 1988616.02, respectively.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1988616.02'} }\n```",
