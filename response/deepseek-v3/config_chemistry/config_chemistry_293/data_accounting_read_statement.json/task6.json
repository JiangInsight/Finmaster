These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Tangible Assets for Production/Use/Rental/Administration**:\n   - Tangible assets used in production, supply, rental, or administration are usually listed under \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet. This includes items like machinery, buildings, vehicles, etc.\n   - In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Fixed Assets\" represents these tangible assets.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Fixed Assets\" is the value at the beginning of the period (Initial_date: 2023-12-31).\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Fixed Assets\" is the value at the end of the period (End_date: 2024-01-30).\n\n3. **Verify the Line Item**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, \"Fixed Assets\" has:\n     - Initial_amount: 5000000.00\n     - End_amount: 5324677.57\n\n4. **Exclude Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is a separate line item that reduces the value of fixed assets, but the question asks for the gross value of tangible assets (before depreciation). Therefore, we use the \"Fixed Assets\" line directly.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5324677.57'}}\n```",
