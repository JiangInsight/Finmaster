In an income statement, these are usually listed under \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expenses.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing the Given Income Statement**: Looking at the provided income statement, we can see a line item labeled \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of \"543212.45.\" This is the most likely candidate for the financing costs.\n\n3. **Verification**: \n   - The \"Financial Expenses\" line is distinct from other expenses like administrative or selling expenses, which are operational rather than financing-related.\n   - The presence of \"Interest Income\" as a separate line item further confirms that \"Financial Expenses\" is the correct line item for financing costs.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of the financing costs is the amount listed under \"Financial Expenses,\" which is \"543212.45.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '543212.45'}}\n```",
