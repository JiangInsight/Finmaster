In a cash flow statement, this is typically represented by the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n   \n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: Looking at the provided cash flow statement, we can see the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of \"391297.55\" and the date \"2024-01-30\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: This line item represents the change in tax payable during the period, which is the increase in tax accrued but not yet paid. The positive value indicates an increase in the liability (tax payable).\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is \"391297.55\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '391297.55'} }\n```",
