                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the answers.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe have three financial statements provided:\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n2. **Income Statement**\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**\n\nWe need to extract two specific pieces of information:\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is likely the \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This seems to be the \"Net Increase\" in cash from the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe examples given show that:\n- `value1` is the \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet.\n- `value2` is the \"Net Increase\" from the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Extracting the Required Information\n\nLet's go through each statement to find these values.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we have the following line items under \"Account\":\n\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- **Interest Receivable**\n- Accounts Receivable\n- Inventory\n- ... and so on.\n\nWe're interested in \"Interest Receivable\". Its \"End_amount\" is `5758.38`.\n\nSo, `value1 = '5758.38'`.\n\n#### 2. Cash Flow Statement\n\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, towards the bottom, there's a section:\n\n```\nCash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-30 |\nBeginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-30 |\nEnding Balance  | 3276562.05 | 2024-01-30 |\nNet Increase  | -4723437.95 | 2024-01-30 |\n```\n\nThe \"Net Increase\" is `-4723437.95`.\n\nSo, `value2 = '-4723437.95'`.\n\n#### 3. Income Statement\n\nThe Income Statement is provided, but based on the examples, we don't need to extract anything from here for this task. The two required values come from the Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- `value1` was \"2672.87\" from \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet.\n- `value2` was \"-7565348.53\" from \"Net Increase\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThis confirms our approach is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5758.38', 'value2': '-4723437.95'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the line items needed**:\n   - Interest accrued but not yet received → \"Interest Receivable\" in Balance Sheet.\n   - Net addition in cash and cash equivalents → \"Net Increase\" in Cash Flow Statement.\n\n2. **Locate \"Interest Receivable\" in Balance Sheet**:\n   - Found under \"Account\" with \"End_amount\" of `5758.38`.\n\n3. **Locate \"Net Increase\" in Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - Found at the bottom with value `-4723437.95`.\n\n4. **Construct the JSON output** with these values.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5758.38', 'value2': '-4723437.95'} }\n```",
