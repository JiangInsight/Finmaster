In the given problem, this is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the value \"7825951.24\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. In the given problem, this is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the value \"6290000.00\".\n\nThe order of the values in the solution should match the order of the line items in the input statement. \n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Locate \"Main Business Revenue\" in the income statement and note its value: \"7825951.24\".\n2. Locate \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement and note its value: \"6290000.00\".\n3. Assign these values to 'value1' and 'value2' respectively, maintaining the original order.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7825951.24', 'value2': '6290000.00'} }\n```",
