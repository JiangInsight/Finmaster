This is because it records the interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**: \n   - **Initial Value**: This is the value of \"Interest Receivable\" at the initial date (2023-12-31). From the table, the initial amount is \"0.00\".\n   - **End Value**: This is the value of \"Interest Receivable\" at the end date (2024-01-30). From the table, the end amount is \"5758.38\".\n\n3. **Verify the Data**: Ensure that the values are correctly extracted from the \"Interest Receivable\" row and that no other line items are mistakenly included.\n\n4. **Format the Solution**: Present the solution in the required JSON format with the initial and end values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5758.38'} }\n```",
