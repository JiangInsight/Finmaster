This is typically found under \"Retained Earnings\" in the Owner's Equity section of the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet. This line item shows the cumulative profits or losses retained in the business after any distributions to shareholders (like dividends).\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" column under \"Retained Earnings\" shows the value at the beginning of the period (initial value).\n   - The \"End_amount\" column under \"Retained Earnings\" shows the value at the end of the period (end value).\n\n3. **Locate the Values in the Given Problem**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, the \"Retained Earnings\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: -1401436.89 (as of 2024-01-30)\n\n4. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value is indeed 0.00, indicating no retained earnings at the start of the period.\n   - The end value is -1401436.89, indicating a loss retained in the entity by the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '-1401436.89'} }\n```",
