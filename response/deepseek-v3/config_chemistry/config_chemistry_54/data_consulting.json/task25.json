                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThe Debt to Equity Ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity.  \n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**  \n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 2,736,025.72  \n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,330,150.23  \n\n**Calculation:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = 2,736,025.72 / 11,330,150.23  \nLet's do the math:  \n2,736,025.72 ÷ 11,330,150.23 ≈ 0.2415\n\n**Rounding to two decimal places:**  \n0.24\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**  \nNet Profit Margin shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.  \n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100\n\n**From the Income Statement:**  \n- Net Profit = -1,669,849.77  \n- Total Revenue = 6,920,513.79  \n\n**Calculation:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (-1,669,849.77 / 6,920,513.79) × 100  \nFirst, divide:  \n-1,669,849.77 ÷ 6,920,513.79 ≈ -0.2413  \nThen multiply by 100:  \n-0.2413 × 100 ≈ -24.13%\n\n**Rounding to two decimal places:**  \n-24.13%\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:**  \nThis ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operations.  \n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**  \n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,714,107.45  \n- From the Balance Sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72  \n\n**Calculation:**  \nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72  \nLet's divide:  \n-5,714,107.45 ÷ 2,736,025.72 ≈ -2.0884\n\n**Rounding to two decimal places:**  \n-2.09\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.24', 'Net Profit Margin': '-24.13%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.09'}}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**  \n   2,736,025.72 / 11,330,150.23 ≈ 0.2415 → 0.24 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**  \n   -1,669,849.77 / 6,920,513.79 ≈ -0.2413 → -24.13% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:**  \n   -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ -2.0884 → -2.09 ✔\n\nAll calculations seem correct based on the provided data. The ratios indicate:\n- The company has a relatively low debt to equity ratio (0.24), meaning it's not highly leveraged.\n- The net profit margin is negative (-24.13%), indicating the company is operating at a loss relative to its revenue.\n- The operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio is also negative (-2.09), suggesting that the company's operating cash flow is insufficient to cover its current liabilities, which could be a liquidity concern.",
