The \"Net Increase\" is -7,161,080.18, which matches the difference between the Beginning Balance and Ending Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents.\n\nGiven the example's approach, it appears the FCF is equated to the \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents. Therefore, we will follow the same approach here.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - FCF = Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents = -7,161,080.18\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-7161080.18'} }\n```",
