                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each of the three required ratios: Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio, Current Assets Turnover Ratio, and Quick Ratio. \n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how much cash flow is generated from operating activities relative to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,714,107.45\n- Net Profit (from income statement) = -1,669,849.77\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-5,714,107.45}{-1,669,849.77} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-5,714,107.45}{-1,669,849.77} \\approx 3.42 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is approximately 3.42.\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the ratio was positive even though both numbers were negative. That makes sense because dividing two negatives gives a positive. So, 3.42 seems correct.\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to calculate Average Current Assets. \n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Current Assets (2023-12-31) = 8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets (2024-01-31) = 7,664,945.72\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Current Assets} + \\text{End Current Assets}}{2} = \\frac{8,000,000 + 7,664,945.72}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{15,664,945.72}{2} = 7,832,472.86 \\]\n\nNow, Total Revenue from the income statement is 6,920,513.79.\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{6,920,513.79}{7,832,472.86} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6,920,513.79}{7,832,472.86} \\approx 0.883 \\]\n\nSo, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio is approximately 0.88.\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio\n\n**Definition**: Also known as the acid-test ratio, it measures a company's ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nWhere Quick Assets = Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable.\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End amounts for 2024-01-31):\n- Cash on Hand = 735,892.55\n- Bank Deposits = 103,027.27\n- Interest Receivable = 2,566.71\n- Accounts Receivable = 2,923,459.19\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Interest Receivable} + \\text{Accounts Receivable} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 735,892.55 + 103,027.27 + 2,566.71 + 2,923,459.19 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 735,892.55 + 103,027.27 = 838,919.82 \\]\n\\[ 838,919.82 + 2,566.71 = 841,486.53 \\]\n\\[ 841,486.53 + 2,923,459.19 = 3,764,945.72 \\]\n\nCurrent Liabilities (Total Current Liabilities) = 2,736,025.72\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{3,764,945.72}{2,736,025.72} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,764,945.72}{2,736,025.72} \\approx 1.376 \\]\n\nSo, the Quick Ratio is approximately 1.38.\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the Quick Assets calculation to ensure I didn't miss anything:\n\n- Cash on Hand: 735,892.55\n- Bank Deposits: 103,027.27 (these are like cash equivalents)\n- Interest Receivable: 2,566.71 (short-term receivable)\n- Accounts Receivable: 2,923,459.19\n\nAdding them up:\n735,892.55 + 103,027.27 = 838,919.82\n838,919.82 + 2,566.71 = 841,486.53\n841,486.53 + 2,923,459.19 = 3,764,945.72\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 2,736,025.72\n\n3,764,945.72 / 2,736,025.72 â‰ˆ 1.376\n\nLooks correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the ratios:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: 3.42\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.88\n3. Quick Ratio: 1.38\n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.42', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.88', 'Quick Ratio': '1.38'} }\n```",
