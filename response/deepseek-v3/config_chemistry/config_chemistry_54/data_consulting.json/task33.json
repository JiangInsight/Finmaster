                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through them step by step, explaining how to calculate each one based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,714,107.45\nFrom the balance sheet (end period):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-5,714,107.45}{2,736,025.72} \\approx -2.09 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the ability of a company to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities are:\n- Accounts Payable = 2,390,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 346,025.72\nTotal Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72 (which seems to be the total debt since there are no long-term liabilities listed).\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-5,714,107.45}{2,736,025.72} \\approx -2.09 \\]\n\n*Note: This seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio because in this case, current liabilities are the only debt listed.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 5,580,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- Ending Inventory = 3,900,000.00\nAverage Inventory = (Initial + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 3,900,000) / 2 = 1,950,000.00\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,580,000.00}{1,950,000.00} \\approx 2.86 \\]\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72 (this seems to be the total liabilities as no long-term liabilities are listed)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,330,150.23\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{2,736,025.72}{11,330,150.23} \\approx 0.24 \\]\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 735,892.55\n- Bank Deposits = 103,027.27\n- Interest Receivable = 2,566.71\n- Accounts Receivable = 2,923,459.19\nTotal Quick Assets = 735,892.55 + 103,027.27 + 2,566.71 + 2,923,459.19 = 3,764,945.72\nCurrent Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{3,764,945.72}{2,736,025.72} \\approx 1.38 \\]\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 7,664,945.72\n- Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{7,664,945.72}{2,736,025.72} \\approx 2.80 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.09', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.09', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '2.86', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.24', 'Quick Ratio': '1.38', 'Current Ratio': '2.80'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify one of the calculations to ensure accuracy. For the Current Ratio:\n- Total Current Assets = 7,664,945.72\n- Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n- 7,664,945.72 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ 2.80 (correct)\n\nSimilarly, for Inventory Turnover:\n- COGS = 5,580,000\n- Average Inventory = 1,950,000\n- 5,580,000 / 1,950,000 ≈ 2.86 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out!",
