                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the five ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Main Business Revenue (assuming all are credit sales) = 6,920,513.79\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial_amount) = 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 2,923,459.19\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = (0 + 2,923,459.19) / 2 = 1,461,729.595\n\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 6,920,513.79 / 1,461,729.595 ≈ 4.73\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,714,107.45\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 2,736,025.72\n\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ -2.09\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio since both use the same components.\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -2.09\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 6,920,513.79\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 14,066,175.95\n\nAverage Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 14,066,175.95) / 2 = 13,533,087.975\n\nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = 6,920,513.79 / 13,533,087.975 ≈ 0.51\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,330,150.23\n\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 2,736,025.72 / 11,330,150.23 ≈ 0.24\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.73', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-2.09', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.09', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.51', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.24'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. AR Turnover: 6,920,513.79 / ((0 + 2,923,459.19)/2) = 6,920,513.79 / 1,461,729.595 ≈ 4.73 ✔\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ -2.09 ✔\n3. Same as above ✔\n4. Total Asset Turnover: 6,920,513.79 / ((13,000,000 + 14,066,175.95)/2) ≈ 0.51 ✔\n5. Debt to Equity: 2,736,025.72 / 11,330,150.23 ≈ 0.24 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!",
