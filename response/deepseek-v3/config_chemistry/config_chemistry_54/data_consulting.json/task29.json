                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate four ratios based on the provided financial statements: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, Return on Assets (ROA), and Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,330,150.23\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{2,736,025.72}{11,330,150.23} \\approx 0.241 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.24.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -1,669,849.77\n- Total Revenue = 6,920,513.79\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{-1,669,849.77}{6,920,513.79} \\times 100\\% \\approx -24.13\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately -24.13%.\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nSince we only have the ending total assets (no beginning total assets for the period), we'll use the ending total assets as an approximation.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets at the end = 14,066,175.95\n- Net Profit = -1,669,849.77\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{-1,669,849.77}{14,066,175.95} \\times 100\\% \\approx -11.87\\% \\]\n\nSo, the ROA is approximately -11.87%.\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects receivables from customers.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since we don't have information on cash sales), we'll use Total Revenue for Net Credit Sales.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 6,920,513.79\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Accounts Receivable at the beginning = 0.00 (since it was 0 on the initial date)\n- Accounts Receivable at the end = 2,923,459.19\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = (0 + 2,923,459.19) / 2 = 1,461,729.595\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\frac{6,920,513.79}{1,461,729.595} \\approx 4.73 \\]\n\nSo, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is approximately 4.73.\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.24', 'Net Profit Margin': '-24.13%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-11.87%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.73'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify the calculations to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 2,736,025.72 / 11,330,150.23 ≈ 0.241 → 0.24 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - -1,669,849.77 / 6,920,513.79 ≈ -0.2413 → -24.13% ✔\n\n3. **ROA:**\n   - -1,669,849.77 / 14,066,175.95 ≈ -0.1187 → -11.87% ✔\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover:**\n   - 6,920,513.79 / 1,461,729.595 ≈ 4.73 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! \n\n**Note on Accounts Receivable Turnover:**\nInitially, I considered if the beginning AR was truly zero, which might imply that all sales in the period were on credit, leading to the ending AR. This seems reasonable given the data. If there were any cash sales, they're not specified, so we proceed with total revenue as credit sales for this calculation.\n\n**Final Json:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.24', 'Net Profit Margin': '-24.13%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-11.87%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.73'}}\n```",
