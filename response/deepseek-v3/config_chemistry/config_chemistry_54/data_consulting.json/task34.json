                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one using the provided financial statements. I'll go through each calculation step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:  \n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,714,107.45  \nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount):  \n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72  \n\nCalculation:  \n= -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72  \n≈ -2.09\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:  \n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72 (since no long-term liabilities are listed)  \n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,330,150.23  \n\nCalculation:  \n= 2,736,025.72 / 11,330,150.23  \n≈ 0.24\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets  \n(Assuming we use End_amount for Total Assets since Initial_amount is the same as the previous period's End_amount)\n\nFrom the income statement:  \n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 6,920,513.79  \nFrom the balance sheet:  \n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 14,066,175.95  \n\nCalculation:  \n= 6,920,513.79 / 14,066,175.95  \n≈ 0.49\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:  \n- Total Current Assets = 7,664,945.72  \n- Inventory = 3,900,000.00  \n- Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72  \n\nCalculation:  \n= (7,664,945.72 - 3,900,000.00) / 2,736,025.72  \n= 3,764,945.72 / 2,736,025.72  \n≈ 1.38\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities  \n(This is the same as the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio)\n\nFrom earlier:  \n= -2.09\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity  \n(Using End_amount for Equity)\n\nFrom the income statement:  \n- Net Profit (Net Income) = -1,669,849.77  \nFrom the balance sheet:  \n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,330,150.23  \n\nCalculation:  \n= -1,669,849.77 / 11,330,150.23  \n≈ -0.1474 or -14.74%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable  \n(Assuming all sales are credit sales since no cash sales are specified)\n\nFrom the income statement:  \n- Total Revenue = 6,920,513.79  \nFrom the balance sheet:  \n- Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 2,923,459.19  \n(Initial_amount was 0.00, so average would be (0 + 2,923,459.19)/2 = 1,461,729.60)\n\nCalculation:  \n= 6,920,513.79 / 1,461,729.60  \n≈ 4.73\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.09', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.24', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.49', 'Quick Ratio': '1.38', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.09', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-14.74%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.73'} }\n```",
