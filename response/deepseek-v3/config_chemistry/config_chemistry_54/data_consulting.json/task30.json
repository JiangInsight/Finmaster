                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 7,664,945.72\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 2,736,025.72\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 7,664,945.72 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ 2.80\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 735,892.55\n- Bank Deposits = 103,027.27\n- Interest Receivable = 2,566.71\n- Accounts Receivable = 2,923,459.19\n- Total Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 735,892.55 + 103,027.27 + 2,566.71 + 2,923,459.19 ≈ 3,764,945.72\n\nQuick Ratio = 3,764,945.72 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ 1.38\n\n*Note:* Inventory is excluded from quick assets, which is why it's not included here.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since there are no non-current liabilities listed) = 2,736,025.72\n- Total Assets = 14,066,175.95\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 2,736,025.72 / 14,066,175.95 ≈ 0.19\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,330,150.23\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 2,736,025.72 / 11,330,150.23 ≈ 0.24\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,714,107.45\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ -2.09\n\n*Note:* A negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, which isn't favorable as it means the company isn't generating enough cash from operations to cover its debt.\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.80', 'Quick Ratio': '1.38', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.19', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.24', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.09'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure accuracy:\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: 7,664,945.72 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ 2.80 (correct)\n2. **Quick Ratio**: (735,892.55 + 103,027.27 + 2,566.71 + 2,923,459.19) / 2,736,025.72 ≈ 3,764,945.72 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ 1.38 (correct)\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: 2,736,025.72 / 14,066,175.95 ≈ 0.19 (correct)\n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**: 2,736,025.72 / 11,330,150.23 ≈ 0.24 (correct)\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ -2.09 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided financial data.",
