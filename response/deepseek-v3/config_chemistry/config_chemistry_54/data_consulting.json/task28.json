                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. I'll go through each one, explaining how to find them using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Liabilities:** This is the \"Total Current Liabilities\" because there are no long-term liabilities listed. So, it's 2,736,025.72.\n- **Total Assets:** 14,066,175.95.\n\nNow, calculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{2,736,025.72}{14,066,175.95} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2,736,025.72}{14,066,175.95} \\approx 0.1945 \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: 0.19.\n\nBut looking at the example, they seem to have rounded to two decimal places without a leading zero, so '0.19'.\n\nWait, the example had '0.14', which is similarly formatted. So, '0.19' seems correct here.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 1,340,513.79\n- **Total Revenue:** 6,920,513.79\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,340,513.79}{6,920,513.79} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,340,513.79}{6,920,513.79} \\approx 0.1937 \\]\n\nMultiply by 100:\n\n\\[ 0.1937 \\times 100 \\approx 19.37\\% \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: '19.37%'.\n\nThe example had '18.80%', so similar format.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -5,714,107.45 (negative value)\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 2,736,025.72 (from balance sheet)\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-5,714,107.45}{2,736,025.72} \\]\n\nDivide:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-5,714,107.45}{2,736,025.72} \\approx -2.088 \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places: '-2.09'.\n\nThe example had '-3.90', so similar format with negative sign.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all three:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.19', 'Gross Profit Margin': '19.37%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.09'}}\n```\n\nLet me double-check the calculations to ensure no mistakes.\n\n**Double-Checking:**\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 2,736,025.72\n   - Assets: 14,066,175.95\n   - 2,736,025.72 / 14,066,175.95 ≈ 0.1945 → '0.19' ✔\n\n2. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: 1,340,513.79\n   - Revenue: 6,920,513.79\n   - (1,340,513.79 / 6,920,513.79) * 100 ≈ 19.37% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -5,714,107.45\n   - Current Liabilities: 2,736,025.72\n   - -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ -2.088 → '-2.09' ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.19', 'Gross Profit Margin': '19.37%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.09'}}\n```",
