                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio to understand how to compute them based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Liabilities:** This is the sum of all liabilities. In the given balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" we have:\n  - Accounts Payable: 2,390,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 346,025.72\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 2,736,025.72\n\n  There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n\n- **Total Assets:** From the balance sheet, \"Total Assets\" at the end date is 14,066,175.95.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{2,736,025.72}{14,066,175.95} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2,736,025.72}{14,066,175.95} \\approx 0.1945 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.19\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given to two decimal places as well, so we'll follow that format.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -5,714,107.45\n- **Net Income (Net Profit):** -1,669,849.77 (from the income statement)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-5,714,107.45}{-1,669,849.77} \\]\n\nDividing two negatives gives a positive:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,714,107.45}{1,669,849.77} \\approx 3.422 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 3.42\n\nHowever, in the example provided, the ratio was '4.41', which suggests that perhaps absolute values are considered or there might be a different interpretation. But based on the standard definition, we take the numbers as they are, negatives included, which cancel out to a positive ratio.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculation:\n\n\\[ 5,714,107.45 ÷ 1,669,849.77 \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n1,669,849.77 × 3 = 5,009,549.31\nSubtract from numerator: 5,714,107.45 - 5,009,549.31 = 704,558.14\n1,669,849.77 × 0.4 = 667,939.908\n704,558.14 - 667,939.908 ≈ 36,618.232\nSo, 3 + 0.4 = 3.4\n36,618.232 / 1,669,849.77 ≈ 0.022\nSo, total ≈ 3.42\n\nYes, it's approximately 3.42.\n\nBut in the example, the operating cash flow was -7,259,994.10 and net income was -1,645,141.43, giving:\n\n7,259,994.10 / 1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSo, it seems the absolute values are used in the ratio, regardless of the signs. That makes sense because the ratio is about the magnitude of cash flow relative to net income, not the direction.\n\nSo, applying that:\n\nAbsolute values:\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: 5,714,107.45\nNet Income: 1,669,849.77\n\nRatio: 5,714,107.45 / 1,669,849.77 ≈ 3.42\n\nHmm, but the example had a higher ratio. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, in the example, the operating cash flow was more negative than net income, leading to a higher ratio. Here, operating cash flow is less negative relative to net income, so the ratio is lower. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is supposed to be negative, but that doesn't make much sense in interpretation. Probably absolute values are correct.\n\nGiven that, our calculation seems correct at approximately 3.42.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to interpret \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\". Sometimes it's called \"Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\", and it's simply operating cash flow divided by net income, signs included.\n\nGiven that, -5,714,107.45 / -1,669,849.77 = 3.42\n\nSame result.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.19', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.42'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Assets, which seems correct, and our calculation matches that method.\n\nSimilarly, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio in the example was:\n\nOperating Cash Flow: -7,259,994.10\nNet Income: -1,645,141.43\nRatio: 7,259,994.10 / 1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSimilarly here:\n\nOperating Cash Flow: -5,714,107.45\nNet Income: -1,669,849.77\nRatio: 5,714,107.45 / 1,669,849.77 ≈ 3.42\n\nSo, it seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.19', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.42'} }\n```",
