                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the given cash flow statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's understand what the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is. This ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income reported by a company. It's a measure of how well a company's net income is being converted into actual cash flow from operations.\n\nThe formula for this ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit (Net Income)}} \\]\n\nFrom the given data, we can see:\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -5,714,107.45\n- **Net Profit (Net Income)**: -1,669,849.77\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, let's plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-5,714,107.45}{-1,669,849.77} \\]\n\nDividing these two negative numbers will give us a positive ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{5,714,107.45}{1,669,849.77} \\]\n\nNow, let's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,714,107.45}{1,669,849.77} \\approx 3.422 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 3.42.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -5,714,107.45\n- Net Profit: -1,669,849.77\n\nDividing the absolute values:\n\n5,714,107.45 ÷ 1,669,849.77 ≈ 3.422\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\n### Comparing with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Ratio given: 4.41\n\nCalculating the example:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7,259,994.10}{1,645,141.43} \\approx 4.41 \\]\n\nThis matches the given solution, so my approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, for the given problem, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is approximately 3.42.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.42'} }\n```",
