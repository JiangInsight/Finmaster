                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios: the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin, based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Quick Ratio (also known as the Acid-Test Ratio):**\n   - This measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n   - Formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - **Quick Assets** typically include:\n     - Cash and cash equivalents\n     - Marketable securities\n     - Accounts receivable\n     - (They exclude inventory and prepaid expenses because they're less liquid)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - This shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n     \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (as of 2024-01-31):\n\n- **Quick Assets:**\n  - Cash on Hand: 735,892.55\n  - Bank Deposits: 103,027.27\n  - Interest Receivable: 2,566.71\n  - Accounts Receivable: 2,923,459.19\n  - (Inventory is excluded from quick assets)\n  \n- **Current Liabilities:**\n  - Accounts Payable: 2,390,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 346,025.72\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 2,736,025.72\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Total Revenue:** 6,920,513.79\n- **Net Profit:** -1,669,849.77 (negative, indicating a loss)\n\n### Calculating Quick Ratio\n\nFirst, sum up the quick assets:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Interest Receivable} + \\text{Accounts Receivable}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 735,892.55 + 103,027.27 + 2,566.71 + 2,923,459.19\n\\]\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n1. 735,892.55 + 103,027.27 = 838,919.82\n2. 838,919.82 + 2,566.71 = 841,486.53\n3. 841,486.53 + 2,923,459.19 = 3,764,945.72\n\nNow, divide by current liabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{3,764,945.72}{2,736,025.72}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3,764,945.72}{2,736,025.72} \\approx 1.376\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: **1.38**\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the Quick Ratio was given as '1.54'. Maybe I missed something. Let me double-check the components.\n\nLooking back, the example included \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" which might be the sum of Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits. But in our case, we've already included both. Maybe the difference is in the Interest Receivable or rounding.\n\nBut our calculation seems correct: \n\n- Quick Assets: 3,764,945.72\n- Current Liabilities: 2,736,025.72\n- Ratio: ~1.376 ≈ 1.38\n\nPerhaps the example had slightly different numbers leading to 1.54. For our current problem, it's 1.38.\n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,669,849.77}{6,920,513.79} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1,669,849.77}{6,920,513.79} \\approx -0.2413\n\\]\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n\n\\[\n-0.2413 \\times 100\\% = -24.13\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is **-24.13%**.\n\n*Again, comparing with the example where it was -30.29%, our calculation seems correct based on the given numbers.*\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- **Quick Ratio:** 1.38\n- **Net Profit Margin:** -24.13%\n\nBut let's present it in the required JSON format with the ratios as strings:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.38', 'Net Profit Margin': '-24.13%'} }\n```\n\n*However, looking back at the initial example, the Quick Ratio was '1.54' for similar numbers, which makes me think if I missed any components. Maybe \"Bank Deposits\" are considered separately from \"Cash on Hand\", but in our calculation, both are included in quick assets. Alternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation of quick assets.*\n\nBut based on standard definitions and the given data, the calculation seems correct. Perhaps the example had additional quick assets not listed here.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.38', 'Net Profit Margin': '-24.13%'} }\n```\n\n*Upon re-evaluating, maybe \"Bank Deposits\" are part of \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\", and in the example, they might have been summed differently. But in our data, both are separate and included. So, no change needed.*\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me verify the quick assets sum:\n\n- Cash on Hand: 735,892.55\n- Bank Deposits: 103,027.27\n- Interest Receivable: 2,566.71\n- Accounts Receivable: 2,923,459.19\nTotal: 735,892.55 + 103,027.27 = 838,919.82\n+ 2,566.71 = 841,486.53\n+ 2,923,459.19 = 3,764,945.72\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 2,736,025.72\n\n3,764,945.72 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ 1.376 → 1.38\n\nNet Profit Margin:\n\n-1,669,849.77 / 6,920,513.79 ≈ -0.2413 → -24.13%\n\nEverything checks out. \n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.38', 'Net Profit Margin': '-24.13%'} }\n```",
