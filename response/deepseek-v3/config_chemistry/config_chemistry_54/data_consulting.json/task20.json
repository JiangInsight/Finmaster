                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n   \n   **Formula**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It indicates short-term liquidity.\n   \n   **Formula**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements:\n\n#### Income Statement:\n- **Total Revenue**: 6,920,513.79\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 5,580,000.00\n- **Gross Profit**: 1,340,513.79\n\n#### Cash Flow Statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -5,714,107.45\n\n#### Balance Sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 2,736,025.72\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,340,513.79}{6,920,513.79} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[\n\\frac{1,340,513.79}{6,920,513.79} \\approx 0.1937\n\\]\n\\[\n0.1937 \\times 100 \\approx 19.37\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **19.37%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-5,714,107.45}{2,736,025.72}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\frac{-5,714,107.45}{2,736,025.72} \\approx -2.088\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **-2.09**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: 1,340,513.79\n   - Total Revenue: 6,920,513.79\n   - 1,340,513.79 / 6,920,513.79 ≈ 0.1937 → 19.37%\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Net Operating Cash Flow: -5,714,107.45\n   - Current Liabilities: 2,736,025.72\n   - -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ -2.088 → -2.09\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '19.37%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.09'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- The Gross Profit Margin of 19.37% indicates that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about $0.1937 after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a measure of production efficiency and pricing strategy.\n  \n- The Operating Cash Flow Ratio is negative (-2.09), which means the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities. This could be a sign of financial stress, especially if this trend continues over time. Negative operating cash flow isn't uncommon for growing companies investing heavily, but it's important to monitor.\n\nThese ratios provide insights into the company's profitability and liquidity, helping stakeholders assess its financial health.",
