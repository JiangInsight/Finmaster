                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows how much gross profit a company makes from its sales. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   It's expressed as a percentage.\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its debts with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \"Total Debt\" can be considered as the \"Total Current Liabilities\" from the balance sheet since that represents the company's short-term obligations.\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the provided financial statements:\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- Total Revenue: \\$6,920,513.79\n- Gross Profit: \\$1,340,513.79\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$5,714,107.45\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$2,736,025.72\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,340,513.79}{6,920,513.79} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[\n\\frac{1,340,513.79}{6,920,513.79} \\approx 0.1937\n\\]\n\\[\n0.1937 \\times 100 \\approx 19.37\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **19.37%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-5,714,107.45}{2,736,025.72}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\frac{-5,714,107.45}{2,736,025.72} \\approx -2.088\n\\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-2.09**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: \\$1,340,513.79\n   - Total Revenue: \\$6,920,513.79\n   - Division: 1,340,513.79 / 6,920,513.79 ≈ 0.1937 → 19.37%\n   - This seems correct.\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$5,714,107.45\n   - Total Current Liabilities: \\$2,736,025.72\n   - Division: -5,714,107.45 / 2,736,025.72 ≈ -2.088 → -2.09\n   - This also seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating both ratios, here's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '19.37%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.09'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin**: A margin of 19.37% means that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about 19.37 cents after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a measure of production efficiency and pricing strategy.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: A negative ratio (-2.09) indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, meaning it's not generating enough cash from operations to cover its current liabilities. This could be a sign of financial stress, especially if sustained over time.\n\nUnderstanding these ratios helps in assessing the company's profitability and financial health. The negative cash flow to debt ratio is particularly concerning and would warrant further investigation into the company's operations and financial management.",
