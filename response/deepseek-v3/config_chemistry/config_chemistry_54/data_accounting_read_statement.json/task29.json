Additionally, we need to decompose this item into 1 component sub-item, all of which must also originate from the input statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Total Income from Ordinary Activities**: \n   - The total income from ordinary activities is typically represented by \"Total Revenue\" in the income statement.\n   - In the given problem, \"Total Revenue\" is listed with an amount of \"6920513.79\".\n\n2. **Identify Constituent Line Items**:\n   - The constituent line item that makes up the \"Total Revenue\" is \"Main Business Revenue\", which is also listed with the same amount of \"6920513.79\". This indicates that \"Main Business Revenue\" is the sole component of \"Total Revenue\".\n\n3. **Decompose into Sub-Items**:\n   - Since \"Main Business Revenue\" is the only component of \"Total Revenue\", it will be the sub-item we decompose.\n   - The initial and final values for the sub-item are both \"6920513.79\" because it is the only component and does not change.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"6920513.79\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"6920513.79\"}}}\n```",
