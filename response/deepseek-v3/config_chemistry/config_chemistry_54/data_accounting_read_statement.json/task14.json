These are typically referred to as \"Current Liabilities\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually within one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are:\n     - Accounts Payable\n     - Taxes Payable\n     - Total Current Liabilities\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" line item provides the aggregate value of all current liabilities at the initial and end dates.\n   - From the table:\n     - **Initial value**: The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` (as of `2023-12-31`).\n     - **End value**: The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `2736025.72` (as of `2024-01-31`).\n\n3. **Verify Components**:\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the sum of \"Accounts Payable\" (`2390000.00`) and \"Taxes Payable\" (`346025.72`), which equals `2736025.72`. This confirms the correctness of the \"End value\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2736025.72'} }\n```",
