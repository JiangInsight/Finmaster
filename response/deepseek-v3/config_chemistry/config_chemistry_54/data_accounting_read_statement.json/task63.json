                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid**: This is likely found in the Balance Sheet under \"Taxes Payable.\"\n2. **Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities**: This is probably the \"Total Revenue\" from the Income Statement.\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities**: This should be the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nThe order to present these is:\n1. Balance Sheet\n2. Income Statement\n3. Cash Flow Statement\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Taxes Payable\nLooking at the Balance Sheet provided, there's a line item:\n```\n| Taxes Payable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 346025.72 | 2024-01-31 |\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" for Taxes Payable is `346025.72`. This represents the taxes accrued but not yet paid at the end of the period.\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Total Revenue\nIn the Income Statement, we see:\n```\n| Total Revenue | 6920513.79 | 2024-01-31 |\n```\nThis is the total income from ordinary activities, which is `6920513.79`.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, the relevant line is:\n```\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -5714107.45 | 2024-01-31 |\n```\nThis is the net cash generated from operating activities, which is `-5714107.45`.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nJust to ensure we're following the correct order:\n1. Balance Sheet (Taxes Payable)\n2. Income Statement (Total Revenue)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities)\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '346025.72', 'value2': '6920513.79', 'value3': '-5714107.45'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Balance Sheet**: Located \"Taxes Payable\" with end amount `346025.72`.\n2. **Income Statement**: Found \"Total Revenue\" as `6920513.79`.\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**: Identified \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" as `-5714107.45`.\n4. Arranged them in the specified order and formatted the answer correctly.",
