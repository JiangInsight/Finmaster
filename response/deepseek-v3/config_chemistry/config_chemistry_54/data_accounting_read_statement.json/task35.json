I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract four specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these are costs related to selling products or services, which includes marketing, sales commissions, and delivery costs.\n   \n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" in the income statement, which includes interest on loans and other costs associated with borrowing money.\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is \"Depreciation,\" which is the allocation of the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is the \"Tax Expense,\" which represents the income tax owed for the period.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\nHere's the income statement we're working with:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 6920513.79 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Total Revenue | 6920513.79 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 5580000.00 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Total Cost | 5580000.00 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Gross Profit | 1340513.79 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 1241966.86 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Selling Expenses | 630420.28 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Depreciation | 45742.50 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Financial Expenses | 748774.91 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Total Expenses | 2666904.55 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Interest Income | 2566.71 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Profit Before Tax | -1323824.05 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Tax Expense | 346025.72 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Net Profit | -1669849.77 | 2024-01-31 |\n\n### Identifying the Four Line Items\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: This is directly listed as \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of `630420.28`.\n   \n2. **Depreciation**: Listed as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of `45742.50`.\n   \n3. **Financial Expenses**: Listed as \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of `748774.91`.\n   \n4. **Tax Expense**: Listed as \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of `346025.72`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure we're matching the correct items:\n\n- In the example, 'value1' was \"Selling Expenses\", 'value2' was \"Depreciation\", 'value3' was \"Financial Expenses\", and 'value4' was \"Tax Expense\". \n\nThis matches our identification above, so we're on the right track.\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, let's plug these values into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '630420.28', 'value2': '45742.50', 'value3': '748774.91', 'value4': '346025.72'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Selling Expenses**: Found as \"Selling Expenses\" → `630420.28`\n2. **Depreciation**: Found as \"Depreciation\" → `45742.50`\n3. **Financial Expenses**: Found as \"Financial Expenses\" → `748774.91`\n4. **Tax Expense**: Found as \"Tax Expense\" → `346025.72`\n\nAll values are correctly identified and placed in the specified order. \n\nTherefore, the final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '630420.28', 'value2': '45742.50', 'value3': '748774.91', 'value4': '346025.72'} }\n```",
