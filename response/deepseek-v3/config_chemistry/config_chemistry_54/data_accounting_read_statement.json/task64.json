Balance Sheet - Paid-in Capital\n- **Account**: Paid-in Capital\n- **End_amount**: 13000000.00\n- This represents the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares.\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Profit Before Tax\n- **Account**: Profit Before Tax\n- **Amount**: -1323824.05\n- This represents the profit or loss for the period before deducting tax expense.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Increase in Accounts Payable\n- **Account**: Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n- **Amount**: 2390000.00\n- This represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n\nNow, we can compile these values into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1323824.05', 'value3': '2390000.00'}}\n```",
