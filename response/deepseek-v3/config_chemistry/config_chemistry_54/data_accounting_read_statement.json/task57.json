This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the balance sheet, which shows the amount owed to suppliers or vendors for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Locate the Accounts Payable Line Item**: \n   - In the provided balance sheet, look for the \"Accounts Payable\" account.\n   - The initial amount is 0.00 as of 2023-12-31.\n   - The end amount is 2,390,000.00 as of 2024-01-31.\n\n2. **Determine the Addition in Amount Owed**:\n   - The increase in \"Accounts Payable\" from the initial amount to the end amount represents the addition in the amount owed during the period.\n   - Calculation: End_amount - Initial_amount = 2,390,000.00 - 0.00 = 2,390,000.00.\n\n3. **Verify with Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The cash flow statement also includes a line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" which confirms the addition of 2,390,000.00 during the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 2,390,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2390000.00'}}\n```",
