In the given problem, the line item is labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is the amount we are interested in. In the given problem, this value is \"1446972.73.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: Ensure that the value is indeed a cash outflow (negative or positive as per the context). Here, the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is negative, which aligns with the interpretation that \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is a cash outflow.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets is \"1446972.73.\"\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1446972.73'} }\n```",
