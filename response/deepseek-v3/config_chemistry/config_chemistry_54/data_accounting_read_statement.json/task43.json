The \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section typically includes the beginning balance, ending balance, and the net increase or decrease.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, the line item \"Beginning Balance\" represents the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: From the given problem, the \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" is listed as `8000000.00` on the date `2024-01-31`.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Beginning Balance\" is indeed the value we are asked to extract, as it represents the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
