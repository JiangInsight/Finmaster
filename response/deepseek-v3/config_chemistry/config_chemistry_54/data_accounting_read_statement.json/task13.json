These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We need to find the line items that represent assets not expected to be realized or consumed within the normal operating cycle. These are usually long-term or non-current assets.\n\n2. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: In the given balance sheet, the non-current assets are:\n   - Fixed Assets\n   - Accumulated Depreciation\n   - Total Non-current Assets\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `5000000.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `6401230.23` as of the end date `2024-01-31`.\n\n4. **Verify**: The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item is the sum of fixed assets minus accumulated depreciation, which aligns with the definition of assets not expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '6401230.23'} }\n```",
