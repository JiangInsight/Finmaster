A negative value here indicates a decrease in inventory, which means that inventory was sold or used up during the period, thus reducing the amount of assets held for sale.\n\nLooking at the provided problem, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" has a value of \"-3900000.00\". This negative value indicates a reduction in inventory.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3900000.00'}}\n```",
