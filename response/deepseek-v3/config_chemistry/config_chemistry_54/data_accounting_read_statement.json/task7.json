However, the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income is not directly provided. \n\n2. **Identify Expense-Related Items**: In the balance sheet, expenses are not directly listed as line items. However, expenses can be inferred from changes in certain accounts. For example:\n   - **Accumulated Depreciation**: This is a contra-asset account that represents the total depreciation expense accumulated over time. The change in this account (from initial to end value) represents the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n3. **Locate Accumulated Depreciation**: \n   - **Initial Amount**: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - **End Amount**: 45742.50 (as of 2024-01-31)\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The depreciation expense for the period is reflected in the change in the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" account. Therefore, the initial and end values of this account can be used to represent the expense.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45742.50'} }\n```",
