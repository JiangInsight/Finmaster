However, this is not the amount sold but the change in inventory levels.\n   - The actual amount of inventory sold is correctly represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" value from the income statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5580000.00'}}\n```",
