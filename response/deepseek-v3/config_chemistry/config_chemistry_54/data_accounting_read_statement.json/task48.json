In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit.\"\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nFrom the given problem, we can locate these two line items and their corresponding amounts:\n\n- **Net Profit**: -1669849.77\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 1446972.73\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-1669849.77', 'value2': '1446972.73'} }\n```",
