For the Balance Sheet (first):\n   - We need \"amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit\" - this is \"Accounts Receivable\"\n   - In the given balance sheet, \"Accounts Receivable\" has an End_amount of \"2923459.19\"\n   - So value1 = '2923459.19'\n\n3. For the Income Statement (second):\n   - We need \"financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation\" - this is \"Financial Expenses\"\n   - In the given income statement, \"Financial Expenses\" is \"748774.91\"\n   - So value2 = '748774.91'\n\n4. For the Cash Flow Statement (third):\n   - We need \"cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets\" - this is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" under Investing Activities\n   - In the given cash flow statement, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is \"1446972.73\"\n   - So value3 = '1446972.73'\n\n5. The final answer in JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2923459.19', 'value2': '748774.91', 'value3': '1446972.73'}}\n```",
