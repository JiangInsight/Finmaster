This typically includes \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" as these are the most liquid assets readily available for operational use.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**:\n   - The line items that represent cash available for day-to-day operations are:\n     - \"Cash on Hand\"\n     - \"Bank Deposits\"\n\n2. **Extract Initial Values**:\n   - \"Cash on Hand\" initial amount: 3000000.00\n   - \"Bank Deposits\" initial amount: 5000000.00\n   - Total initial cash = 3000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 8000000.00\n\n3. **Extract End Values**:\n   - \"Cash on Hand\" end amount: 735892.55\n   - \"Bank Deposits\" end amount: 103027.27\n   - Total end cash = 735892.55 + 103027.27 = 838919.82\n\n4. **Verify Against Total Current Assets**:\n   - The total initial current assets are 8000000.00, which matches the sum of initial \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" (since other current assets like \"Interest Receivable\", \"Accounts Receivable\", and \"Inventory\" are initially 0.00).\n   - The total end current assets are 7664945.72, which includes the sum of end \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" (838919.82) plus other current assets like \"Interest Receivable\" (2566.71), \"Accounts Receivable\" (2923459.19), and \"Inventory\" (3900000.00). This confirms our extraction is correct.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial value of cash available for day-to-day operations is the sum of initial \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\": 8000000.00.\n   - The end value of cash available for day-to-day operations is the sum of end \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\": 838919.82.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '838919.82'} }\n```",
