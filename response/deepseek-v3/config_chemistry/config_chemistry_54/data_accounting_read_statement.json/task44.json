The value we are interested in is the \"Ending Balance\" of \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\".\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, there are three line items:\n   - Beginning Balance\n   - Ending Balance\n   - Net Increase\n\n3. **Identify the Ending Balance**: The \"Ending Balance\" represents the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period. In the provided problem, the \"Ending Balance\" is listed as \"838919.82\" on the date \"2024-01-31\".\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value to be extracted is \"838919.82\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '838919.82'}}\n```",
