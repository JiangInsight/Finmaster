I'm going to go through the cash flow statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific pieces of information from the cash flow statement:\n\n1. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This typically refers to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" because accounts payable represent amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n   \n2. **Acquisition of property, plant and equipment**: This is usually listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement under investing activities.\n\n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: This is straightforward; it's the \"Beginning Balance\" under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Cash Flow Statement\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement and locate these items.\n\n#### 1. Increase in Accounts Payable\nLooking under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities,\" we see:\n- Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 2390000.00\n\nThis is the amount by which accounts payable increased during the period, indicating more goods or services were purchased on credit.\n\n#### 2. Purchase of Fixed Assets\nUnder \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" we find:\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: 1446972.73\n\nThis represents the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment during the period.\n\n#### 3. Cash and Cash Equivalents at Beginning of Period\nUnder \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" we see:\n- Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n\nThis is the cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the example provided:\n- 'value1' was \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\"\n- 'value2' was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"\n- 'value3' was \"Beginning Balance\"\n\nThis matches our understanding.\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling the values we've identified:\n1. Increase in Accounts Payable: 2390000.00\n2. Purchase of Fixed Assets: 1446972.73\n3. Beginning Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents: 8000000.00\n\nPutting this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2390000.00', 'value2': '1446972.73', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
