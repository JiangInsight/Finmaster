In the given problem, the Selling Expenses amount is `630420.28`.\n   - **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is typically found in the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item in the Cash Flow Statement under Investing Activities. In the given problem, the Purchase of Fixed Assets amount is `1446972.73`.\n\n2. **Order of financial statements**:\n   - The task specifies grouping by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. However, the required line items are found in the Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement, so the Balance Sheet is not relevant here. The order within the solution is maintained as per the task instructions.\n\n3. **Final output**:\n   - The values are extracted and formatted as specified in the task. The first value (`value1`) is from the Income Statement, and the second value (`value2`) is from the Cash Flow Statement. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '630420.28', 'value2': '1446972.73'}}\n```",
