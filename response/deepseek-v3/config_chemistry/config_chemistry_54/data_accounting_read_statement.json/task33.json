In the given problem, this is \"Main Business Revenue\" with an amount of \"6920513.79\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item, as it reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. In the given problem, this is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with an amount of \"5580000.00\".\n\nThe order of these values in the output should match their order in the input statement. \n\nHere is the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6920513.79', 'value2': '5580000.00'}}\n```",
