I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the required values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to extract two specific line items from the provided financial statements:\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically found as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet. It represents interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n   \n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is usually the \"Net Increase\" in the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section of the cash flow statement. It shows the net change in cash and cash equivalents over the period.\n\nThe financial statements are grouped in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we should maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Example\n\nLooking at the example given:\n\n- **Interest Receivable**: Found in the balance sheet with an \"End_amount\" of `2672.87`.\n- **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Found in the cash flow statement with an \"Amount\" of `-7565348.53`.\n\nSo, the solution was:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2672.87', 'value2': '-7565348.53'}}\n```\n\nThis confirms that:\n- `value1` is the \"Interest Receivable\" from the balance sheet.\n- `value2` is the \"Net Increase\" from the cash flow statement.\n\n### Solving the Given Problem\n\nNow, let's apply this to the problem we need to solve.\n\n#### 1. Interest Accrued but Not Yet Received (Interest Receivable)\n\nLooking at the **balance sheet**, we find the \"Interest Receivable\" line:\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Interest Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 2566.71 | 2024-01-31 |\n\nSo, the \"End_amount\" is `2566.71`. This is `value1`.\n\n#### 2. Net Addition in Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nNow, looking at the **cash flow statement**, we find the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-31 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Ending Balance  | 838919.82 | 2024-01-31 |\n| Net Increase  | -7161080.18 | 2024-01-31 |\n\nThe \"Net Increase\" is `-7161080.18`. This is `value2`.\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nThe financial statements are already in the correct order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. The line items are also in their original order within each statement.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2566.71', 'value2': '-7161080.18'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify Interest Receivable**:\n   - Located in the Balance Sheet under \"Interest Receivable\".\n   - End amount: `2566.71` → `value1`.\n\n2. **Identify Net Addition in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - Located in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n   - Net Increase: `-7161080.18` → `value2`.\n\n3. **Ensure Correct Order**:\n   - Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n   - Line items are in original order within each statement.\n\n4. **Construct JSON Solution**:\n   - `value1`: Interest Receivable amount.\n   - `value2`: Net Increase in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2566.71', 'value2': '-7161080.18'}}\n```",
