These are typically referred to as \"Current Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all such assets.\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is the value at the beginning of the period (Initial_date: 2023-12-31).\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is the value at the end of the period (End_date: 2024-01-31).\n\n3. **Extract Values**:\n   - From the table, the \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is `8000000.00`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is `7664945.72`.\n\n4. **Verify**: Ensure that these values correspond to the \"Total Current Assets\" line item and not other categories like \"Total Non-current Assets\" or \"Total Assets\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7664945.72'} }\n```",
