There are no other line items (e.g., \"Inventory\" or \"Change in Inventory\") that would better represent this value in the given data.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"5580000.00.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5580000.00'}}\n```",
