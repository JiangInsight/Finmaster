Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the cash flow statement, depreciation is typically listed under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" as it is a non-cash expense added back to net profit to reconcile net profit to net cash flow from operating activities.\n\n3. **Identify the Value**: From the given cash flow statement, the line item \"Depreciation\" is clearly listed with an amount of \"45742.50\" and a date of \"2024-01-31\".\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The value \"45742.50\" is indeed associated with \"Depreciation\", which matches the description of the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45742.50'} }\n```",
