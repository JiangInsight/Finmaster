These items are typically categorized as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents tangible assets held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\". This is because fixed assets include property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) which are used in these capacities.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as \"5000000.00\" under the \"Initial_amount\" column with the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is provided as \"6446972.73\" under the \"End_amount\" column with the \"End_date\" of \"2024-01-31\".\n\n4. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is a contra-asset account that reduces the value of fixed assets. However, the net value of fixed assets is already reflected in the \"Total Non-current Assets\" line, which is \"6401230.23\". This indicates that the \"Fixed Assets\" value of \"6446972.73\" is before accounting for depreciation. Since the task asks for the value of the tangible items (which is typically the gross value before depreciation), we use the \"Fixed Assets\" value directly.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '6446972.73'} }\n```",
