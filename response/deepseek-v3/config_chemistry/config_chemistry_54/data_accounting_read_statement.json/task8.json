These amounts are typically listed under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet, as they represent the money owed to suppliers or vendors for credit purchases.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Payable\" is the standard account that records the amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, locate the \"Accounts Payable\" row.\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" column shows the value at the start of the period (2023-12-31), which is \"0.00\".\n   - The \"End_amount\" column shows the value at the end of the period (2024-01-31), which is \"2390000.00\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The initial value of \"0.00\" indicates no outstanding payables at the start of the period.\n   - The end value of \"2390000.00\" indicates the amount owed at the end of the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2390000.00'} }\n```",
