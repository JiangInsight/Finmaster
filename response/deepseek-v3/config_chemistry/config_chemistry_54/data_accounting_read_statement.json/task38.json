This is typically reflected in the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item in the cash flow statement under the \"Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity for credit sales or services provided.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the cash flow statement provided, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" represents the change in accounts receivable. A negative value here indicates an increase in accounts receivable (meaning less cash was collected than sales made on credit), and a positive value would indicate a decrease in accounts receivable (meaning more cash was collected than sales made on credit).\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is \"-2923459.19\". This negative value indicates an increase in accounts receivable, which means there was a decrease in the amounts owed to the entity (since less cash was collected).\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The value to be extracted is \"-2923459.19\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2923459.19'}}\n```",
