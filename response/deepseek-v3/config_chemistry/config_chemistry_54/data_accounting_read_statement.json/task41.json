In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we look for the line item related to tax payable. We find:\n   - \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of \"346025.72\" on the date \"2024-01-31\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: The line item is correctly placed under the operating activities section, which is where changes in tax payable (accrued taxes) are typically reported.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with the increase in tax payable is \"346025.72\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '346025.72'}}\n```",
