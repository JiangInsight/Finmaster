                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to extract the four specific line items from the balance sheet provided. Based on the task description, these items are:\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically listed as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n2. **Accumulated systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is usually \"Accumulated Depreciation\".\n3. **Tax payable**: This is listed as \"Taxes Payable\".\n4. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is often \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\nNow, let's find each of these in the provided balance sheet and note their initial and end amounts.\n\n### 1. Interest Receivable\nLooking at the table:\n- **Account**: Interest Receivable\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00\n  - End_amount: 2566.71\n\nSo:\n- initial value1: '0.00'\n- end valu1: '2566.71'\n\n### 2. Accumulated Depreciation\nFrom the table:\n- **Account**: Accumulated Depreciation\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00\n  - End_amount: 45742.50\n\nSo:\n- initial value2: '0.00'\n- end valu2: '45742.50'\n\n### 3. Taxes Payable\nFrom the table:\n- **Account**: Taxes Payable\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00\n  - End_amount: 346025.72\n\nSo:\n- initial value3: '0.00'\n- end valu3: '346025.72'\n\n### 4. Paid-in Capital\nFrom the table:\n- **Account**: Paid-in Capital\n  - Initial_amount: 13000000.00\n  - End_amount: 13000000.00\n\nSo:\n- initial value4: '13000000.00'\n- end valu4: '13000000.00'\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe task mentions maintaining the original line item order as shown in the input statement. Looking at the table, the order is:\n1. Interest Receivable\n2. Accumulated Depreciation\n3. Taxes Payable\n4. Paid-in Capital\n\nThis matches the order we've followed.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '2566.71', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '45742.50', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '346025.72', 'initial value4': '13000000.00', 'end valu4': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
