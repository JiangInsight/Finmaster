                        "content": "To calculate the \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" for the cash flow statement, we need to analyze the inventory changes based on the purchase and sale transactions. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Purchase Transactions (Inventory Increase):**\n   - All transactions with type \"Purchase\" represent inventory increases. We sum the `amount` for these transactions.\n   - Purchase transactions in the data:\n     - Purchase20231231001: 1,100,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231002: 240,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231003: 90,000.00 (Unpaid, but still affects inventory)\n     - Purchase20231231004: 300,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231005: 320,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231006: 850,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231007: 480,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231008: 2,300,000.00 (Unpaid, but still affects inventory)\n     - Purchase20231231009: 1,400,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231010: 1,700,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231011: 300,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231012: 60,000.00\n     - Purchase20231231013: 340,000.00\n   - Total Purchases = 1,100,000 + 240,000 + 90,000 + 300,000 + 320,000 + 850,000 + 480,000 + 2,300,000 + 1,400,000 + 1,700,000 + 300,000 + 60,000 + 340,000 = **9,480,000.00**\n\n2. **Identify Sale Transactions (Inventory Decrease):**\n   - All transactions with type \"Sale\" represent inventory decreases. We sum the `cost_amount` for these transactions (since this represents the cost of goods sold).\n   - Sale transactions and their `cost_amount`:\n     - Sale20240102003: 50,000.00\n     - Sale20240102004: 150,000.00\n     - Sale20240103006: 80,000.00\n     - Sale20240103007: 100,000.00\n     - Sale20240104008: 40,000.00\n     - Sale20240105009: 200,000.00\n     - Sale20240105010: 20,000.00\n     - Sale20240106012: 60,000.00\n     - Sale20240106013: 150,000.00\n     - Sale20240107015: 150,000.00\n     - Sale20240107016: 40,000.00\n     - Sale20240108018: 250,000.00\n     - Sale20240108019: 20,000.00\n     - Sale20240109020: 20,000.00\n     - Sale20240109021: 50,000.00\n     - Sale20240110023: 150,000.00\n     - Sale20240111024: 200,000.00\n     - Sale20240112025: 20,000.00\n     - Sale20240113027: 30,000.00\n     - Sale20240114028: 100,000.00\n     - Sale20240114029: 80,000.00\n     - Sale20240115031: 40,000.00\n     - Sale20240115032: 500,000.00\n     - Sale20240116034: 60,000.00\n     - Sale20240117035: 80,000.00\n     - Sale20240117036: 400,000.00\n     - Sale20240118038: 50,000.00\n     - Sale20240118039: 250,000.00\n     - Sale20240119041: 40,000.00\n     - Sale20240120042: 20,000.00\n     - Sale20240120043: 50,000.00\n     - Sale20240121044: 10,000.00\n     - Sale20240122045: 500,000.00\n     - Sale20240123047: 80,000.00\n     - Sale20240123048: 250,000.00\n     - Sale20240124050: 500,000.00\n     - Sale20240125052: 40,000.00\n     - Sale20240126054: 400,000.00\n     - Sale20240127055: 150,000.00\n     - Sale20240128057: 100,000.00\n     - Sale20240129058: 100,000.00\n   - Total Cost of Goods Sold = Sum of all `cost_amount` = **5,350,000.00**\n\n3. **Calculate Net Inventory Change:**\n   - Net Inventory Change = Total Purchases - Total Cost of Goods Sold\n   - Net Inventory Change = 9,480,000.00 - 5,350,000.00 = **4,130,000.00**\n\n4. **Cash Flow Statement Adjustment:**\n   - The cash flow statement shows the change in working capital. An increase in inventory is a use of cash (negative impact), while a decrease is a source of cash (positive impact).\n   - Since inventory increased by 4,130,000.00, this is a use of cash and should be reported as a negative value in the cash flow statement.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" is **-4,130,000.00**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-4130000.00'}}\n```",
