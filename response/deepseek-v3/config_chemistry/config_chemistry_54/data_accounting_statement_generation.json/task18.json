Owner's equity is calculated as the sum of all assets minus the sum of all liabilities. However, in this context, we can infer that the initial owner's equity is the sum of the initial deposits (cash, bank, and fixed assets), and the final owner's equity is the initial equity plus the net profit (or minus the net loss) from operations.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Initial Owner's Equity\nThe initial owner's equity is the sum of the initial deposits:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n\nInitial Owner's Equity = 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 13,000,000.0\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Net Profit\nNet profit is calculated as the sum of all profits from sales minus the sum of all expenses (including depreciation and other expenses).\n\n#### Sum of Profits from Sales:\nFrom the transactions data, we can see that each sale has a \"profit\" field. We need to sum all these profits:\n- Sale20240102003: 6,077.82\n- Sale20240102004: 43,142.64\n- Sale20240103006: 24,969.84\n- Sale20240103007: 38,398.85\n- Sale20240104008: 8,796.16\n-
