Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Revenue Transactions (Sales):**\n   - These are transactions where the type is \"Sale\". We need to sum up the \"profit\" column for all these transactions.\n\n2. **Identify Expense Transactions:**\n   - These include transactions where the type is \"Expense\", \"Depreciation\", or \"Interest Receivables\" (since interest income is not part of operating profit). We need to sum up the \"amount\" column for these transactions.\n\n3. **Calculate Net Profit:**\n   - Net Profit = Total Revenue (from Sales) - Total Expenses (including Depreciation and Interest Receivables).\n\n### Step 1: Sum of Profits from Sales\nFrom the given data, we sum all the \"profit\" values from the \"Sale\" transactions. \n\n### Step 2: Sum of Expenses\nFrom the given data, we sum all the \"amount\" values from the \"Expense\", \"Depreciation\", and \"Interest Receivables\" transactions.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Net Profit\nSubtract the total expenses from the total revenue (profits from sales).\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the net profit is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '-1645141.43'}}\n```",
