Accounts payable represents the amount a company owes to its suppliers for purchases made on credit. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Accounts Payable:**\n   - The initial accounts payable is the amount owed to suppliers at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31). \n   - From the transactions data, we look for purchases where the `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" and the `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\" on or before the initial date (2023-12-31).\n   - In the given data, there are two such transactions:\n     - `Purchase20231231003`: Amount = 90,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n     - `Purchase20231231008`: Amount = 2,300,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n   - Total initial accounts payable = 90,000.0 + 2,300,000.0 = 2,390,000.0\n\n2. **Identify Final Accounts Payable:**\n   - The final accounts payable is the amount owed to suppliers at the end of the period (after all transactions up to 2024-01-31).\n   - From the transactions data, we look for purchases where the `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" and the `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\" as of the end date.\n   - In the given data, there is only one such transaction:\n     - `Purchase20231231003`: Amount = 90,000.0 (Unpaid, Account Payable)\n   - The other initial unpaid purchase (`Purchase20231231008`) does not appear to have been paid, but since it is not explicitly marked as unpaid in the final data, we assume it has been paid. Thus, only the 90,000.0 remains unpaid.\n   - Total final accounts payable = 90,000.0\n\n3. **Format the Solution:**\n   - The initial and final accounts payable values are formatted as strings with two decimal places.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '2390000.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '90000.00'} }\n```",
