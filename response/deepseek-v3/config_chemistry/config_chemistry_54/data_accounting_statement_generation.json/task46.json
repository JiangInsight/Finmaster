Fixed assets are not considered part of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFrom the problem data:\n1. Initial cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n2. Initial bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n\nAdding these together gives the beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents:\n3,000,000.0 (cash) + 5,000,000.0 (bank) = 8,000,000.0\n\nThe fixed assets (5,000,000.0) are not included in the cash and cash equivalents balance as they are long-term assets.\n\nThus, the beginning balance is 8,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
