I'm going to calculate the total amount of cash on hand for the balance sheet, including both the initial and final amounts. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a dataset of transactions, and we need to determine:\n1. **Initial Cash on Hand**: This is the starting amount of cash at the beginning of the period.\n2. **Final Cash on Hand**: This is the ending amount of cash after all transactions have been accounted for.\n\nFrom the example provided, the initial cash is the amount from the \"Cash deposit\" transaction, and the final cash is calculated by adjusting the initial cash with all cash inflows and outflows during the period.\n\n### Identifying Relevant Transactions\n\n1. **Initial Cash on Hand**:\n   - Look for transactions where `type` is \"Cash deposit\" and `date` is the initial date (2023-12-31 in this case).\n   \n2. **Cash Transactions Affecting the Balance**:\n   - **Cash Inflows**:\n     - Sales where `receive_method` is \"Cash\".\n     - Any other transactions that increase cash where `payment_method` is \"Cash\".\n   - **Cash Outflows**:\n     - Expenses where `payment_method` is \"Cash\".\n     - Purchases where `payment_method` is \"Cash\".\n     - Transfers out of cash (like \"Cash to bank transfer\").\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**1. Initial Cash on Hand**:\n   - From the data, the initial cash deposit is:\n     - `Initial20231231001 | Cash deposit | 2023-12-31 | ... | 3000000.0 | ...`\n     - So, **Initial Cash = 3,000,000.00**\n\n**2. Calculating Final Cash on Hand**:\n   - Start with initial cash: 3,000,000.00\n   - Add all cash inflows:\n     - Sales received in cash.\n     - Other cash receipts (if any).\n   - Subtract all cash outflows:\n     - Expenses paid in cash.\n     - Purchases paid in cash.\n     - Cash transfers to bank.\n\n**Identifying Cash Inflows (Sales with receive_method = Cash)**:\n   - `Sale20240102003 | ... | Cash | ... | 56077.82`\n   - `Sale20240102004 | ... | Cash | ... | 193142.64`\n   - `Sale20240103006 | ... | Cash | ... | 104969.84`\n   - `Sale20240103007 | ... | Cash | ... | 138398.85`\n   - `Sale20240104008 | ... | Cash | ... | 48796.16`\n   - `Sale20240105010 | ... | Cash | ... | 22074.18`\n   - `Sale20240106012 | ... | Cash | ... | 68008.23`\n   - `Sale20240106013 | ... | Cash | ... | 170944.38`\n   - `Sale20240107016 | ... | Cash | ... | 51671.14`\n   - `Sale20240108018 | ... | Cash | ... | 294069.55`\n   - `Sale20240108019 | ... | Cash | ... | 26025.66`\n   - `Sale20240109021 | ... | Cash | ... | 60004.1`\n   - `Sale20240110023 | ... | Cash | ... | 169987.71`\n   - `Sale20240111024 | ... | Cash | ... | 224082.4`\n   - `Sale20240114028 | ... | Cash | ... | 126665.25`\n   - `Sale20240114029 | ... | Cash | ... | 109485.16`\n   - `Sale20240115031 | ... | Cash | ... | 44884.56`\n   - `Sale20240115032 | ... | Cash | ... | 670520.35`\n   - `Sale20240116034 | ... | Cash | ... | 81238.02`\n   - `Sale20240117036 | ... | Cash | ... | 537491.12`\n   - `Sale20240118038 | ... | Cash | ... | 56327.85`\n   - `Sale20240120043 | ... | Cash | ... | 59691.99`\n   - `Sale20240121044 | ... | Cash | ... | 11720.95`\n   - `Sale20240125052 | ... | Cash | ... | 47724.26`\n   - `Sale20240126054 | ... | Cash | ... | 449578.36`\n   - `Sale20240129058 | ... | Cash | ... | 134841.9`\n\n   Let's sum all these:\n   - 56077.82 + 193142.64 = 249,220.46\n   - + 104969.84 = 354,190.30\n   - + 138398.85 = 492,589.15\n   - + 48796.16 = 541,385.31\n   - + 22074.18 = 563,459.49\n   - + 68008.23 = 631,467.72\n   - + 170944.38 = 802,412.10\n   - + 51671.14 = 854,083.24\n   - + 294069.55 = 1,148,152.79\n   - + 26025.66 = 1,174,178.45\n   - + 60004.1 = 1,234,182.55\n   - + 169987.71 = 1,404,170.26\n   - + 224082.4 = 1,628,252.66\n   - + 126665.25 = 1,754,917.91\n   - + 109485.16 = 1,864,403.07\n   - + 44884.56 = 1,909,287.63\n   - + 670520.35 = 2,579,807.98\n   - + 81238.02 = 2,661,046.00\n   - + 537491.12 = 3,198,537.12\n   - + 56327.85 = 3,254,864.97\n   - + 59691.99 = 3,314,556.96\n   - + 11720.95 = 3,326,277.91\n   - + 47724.26 = 3,374,002.17\n   - + 449578.36 = 3,823,580.53\n   - + 134841.9 = 3,958,422.43\n\n   **Total Cash Inflows from Sales = 3,958,422.43**\n\n**Identifying Cash Outflows**:\n   - **Expenses paid in cash**:\n     - All expenses where `payment_method` is \"Cash\".\n     - From the data, all expenses seem to be paid in cash unless specified otherwise.\n     - Sum all `amount` values where `type` is \"Expense\" and `payment_method` is \"Cash\".\n     - Similarly, purchases paid in cash and cash transfers out.\n\n   Let's list all cash outflows:\n\n   **a.
