This is typically referred to as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify Depreciation in the Balance Sheet**: \n   - In the balance sheet, look for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" under the \"Fixed Assets\" section. The value here is \"45745.79\" as of the end date \"2024-01-29\".\n\n2. **Verify Depreciation in the Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - In the cash flow statement, under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\", there is a line item \"Depreciation\" with the value \"45745.79\". This matches the accumulated depreciation from the balance sheet.\n\n3. **Cross-Check Depreciation in the Income Statement**: \n   - In the income statement, under \"Total Expenses\", there is a line item \"Depreciation\" with the value \"45745.79\". This confirms the consistency of the depreciation value across all financial statements.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is represented by the \"Depreciation\" line item, and its value is consistently reported as \"45745.79\" across all relevant sections of the financial statements.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45745.79'}}\n```",
