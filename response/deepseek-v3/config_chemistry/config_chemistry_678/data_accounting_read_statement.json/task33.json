In the given problem, this is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the amount \"5755241.17\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is usually represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item, which reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the entity. In the given problem, this is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with the amount \"4680000.00\".\n\nThe solution requires maintaining the original order of these line items as they appear in the input statement. \n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. Identify the line item for core operating income: \"Main Business Revenue\" → Amount: \"5755241.17\".\n2. Identify the line item for the carrying amount of inventories sold: \"Cost of Goods Sold\" → Amount: \"4680000.00\".\n3. Present the values in the order they appear in the input statement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5755241.17', 'value2': '4680000.00'} }\n```",
