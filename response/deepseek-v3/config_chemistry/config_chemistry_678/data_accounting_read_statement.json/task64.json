                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement extraction task step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares** (from the Balance Sheet).\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense** (from the Income Statement).\n3. **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period** (from the Cash Flow Statement).\n\nThe order is important: Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Capital Contributed by Shareholders\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, the line item that represents capital contributed by shareholders is typically called \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Share Capital\". \n\nIn the given Balance Sheet:\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\nThis shows that the capital contributed by shareholders is `13000000.00` at both the start and end of the period. So, `value1` is `'13000000.00'`.\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Profit Before Tax\nFrom the Income Statement, we need the profit or loss before tax expense. This is usually labeled as \"Profit Before Tax\" or \"Income Before Taxes\".\n\nIn the given Income Statement:\n```\nProfit Before Tax | -1064617.58 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\nSo, `value2` is `'-1064617.58'`.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Increase in Accounts Payable\nNow, from the Cash Flow Statement, we need the addition in the amount owed for goods/services purchased on credit during the period. This is typically the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line.\n\nIn the given Cash Flow Statement:\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 450000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\nThis indicates that the amount owed increased by `450000.00` during the period. So, `value3` is `'450000.00'`.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nLet's ensure we're following the correct order:\n1. Balance Sheet: Paid-in Capital → `13000000.00`\n2. Income Statement: Profit Before Tax → `-1064617.58`\n3. Cash Flow Statement: Increase in Accounts Payable → `450000.00`\n\nThis matches the required order.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1064617.58', 'value3': '450000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Balance Sheet**: Located \"Paid-in Capital\" with end amount `13000000.00` → `value1`.\n2. **Income Statement**: Found \"Profit Before Tax\" as `-1064617.58` → `value2`.\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**: Identified \"Increase in Accounts Payable\" as `450000.00` → `value3`.\n4. Verified the order of statements and line items.\n5. Compiled the final JSON answer.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures that we accurately extract the required information from each financial statement in the correct order.",
