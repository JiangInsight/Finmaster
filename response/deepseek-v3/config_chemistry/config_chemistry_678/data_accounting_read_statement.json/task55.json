This matches the tax expense from the income statement, confirming the amount.\n\n3. **Cross-check with Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The cash flow statement includes an \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" line item with an amount of \"287762.05\" on \"2024-01-29\". This further confirms the tax amount to be paid or recovered.\n\nThus, the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period is \"287762.05\".\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '287762.05'}}\n```",
