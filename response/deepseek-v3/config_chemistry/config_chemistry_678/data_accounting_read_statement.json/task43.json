This value represents the cash and cash equivalents at the start of the period.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section is clearly marked. Under this section, there are three line items:\n   - \"Beginning Balance\"\n   - \"Ending Balance\"\n   - \"Net Increase\"\n\n3. **Identify the Correct Line Item**: The \"Beginning Balance\" is the line item that shows the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period. \n\n4. **Extract the Value**: From the table, the \"Beginning Balance\" is listed as \"8000000.00\" on the date \"2024-01-29\".\n\n5. **Verify**: Cross-checking with the example provided, the \"Beginning Balance\" was correctly identified as the value to extract, and the format of the solution is to present it in a JSON with the key 'value'.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
