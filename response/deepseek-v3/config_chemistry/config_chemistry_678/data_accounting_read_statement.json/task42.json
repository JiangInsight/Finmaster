The line item we are interested in (cash payments for PP&E and other long-term assets) typically appears under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: Within the investing activities section, look for a line item that describes the purchase or acquisition of fixed assets or long-term assets. Common descriptions include \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" \"Capital Expenditures,\" or \"Payments for Property, Plant, and Equipment.\"\n3. **Extract the Value**: Once the relevant line item is identified, extract the corresponding amount.\n\n### Applying to the Given Problem:\n- In the provided cash flow statement, under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section, the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is present with an amount of `480116.37`.\n- This line item represents the cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '480116.37'}}\n```",
