This is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we can see the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of \"287762.05\" dated \"2024-01-29\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: This line item is indeed under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, which is the correct section for such adjustments related to accrued taxes.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is \"287762.05\", which represents the increase in tax accrued but not yet paid.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '287762.05'}}\n```",
