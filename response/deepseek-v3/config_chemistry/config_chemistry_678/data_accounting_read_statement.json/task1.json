Following the example, we should only consider the \"Cash on Hand\" line item.\n\n### Corrected Step-by-Step Calculation (Following the Example):\n\n1. **Initial Value**:\n   - Cash on Hand Initial_amount: 3000000.00\n\n2. **End Value**:\n   - Cash on Hand End_amount: -206636.07\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '-206636.07'} }\n```",
