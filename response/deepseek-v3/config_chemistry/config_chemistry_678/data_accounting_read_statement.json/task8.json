This typically refers to \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet, as it represents the amounts owed to suppliers or vendors for goods or services received on credit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Payable\" is the standard account that records the amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and End Values**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, the \"Accounts Payable\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 450000.00 (as of 2024-01-29)\n\n3. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The initial value is 0.00, indicating no outstanding payables at the start of the period.\n   - The end value is 450000.00, indicating the amount owed at the end of the period.\n\n4. **Exclude Other Liabilities**:\n   - Other line items like \"Taxes Payable\" or \"Total Current Liabilities\" are not relevant here, as they do not represent amounts owed for goods or services received on credit.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '450000.00'} }\n```",
