The line item we are interested in is \"Bank Deposits,\" which is clearly listed in the table. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant line item**: The line item \"Bank Deposits\" is present in the balance sheet under the \"Account\" column.\n2. **Extract the initial value**: The initial amount for \"Bank Deposits\" is listed as \"5000000.00\" under the \"Initial_amount\" column.\n3. **Extract the end value**: The end amount for \"Bank Deposits\" is listed as \"2406.99\" under the \"End_amount\" column.\n\nThus, the initial and end values for \"Bank Deposits\" are as follows:\n\n- Initial value: '5000000.00'\n- End value: '2406.99'\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '2406.99'} }\n```",
