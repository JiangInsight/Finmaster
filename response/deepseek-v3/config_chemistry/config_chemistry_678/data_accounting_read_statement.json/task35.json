I'm going to identify the four specific line items from the income statement based on the descriptions provided in the task. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Task\nThe task asks us to extract four specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This likely refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these are costs associated with marketing, selling, and delivering products to customers.\n   \n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is typically referred to as \"Financial Expenses\" in the income statement, which includes interest on loans and other financing costs.\n   \n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is \"Depreciation,\" which represents the allocation of the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives.\n   \n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is the \"Tax Expense,\" which shows the taxes owed or recovered for the period.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\nNow, let's look at the provided income statement and pick out these items:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 5755241.17 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Revenue | 5755241.17 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 4680000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Cost | 4680000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Gross Profit | 1075241.17 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 1082287.97 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Selling Expenses | 463643.51 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Depreciation | 45745.79 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Financial Expenses | 549407.19 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Expenses | 2141084.46 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Interest Income | 1225.71 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Profit Before Tax | -1064617.58 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Tax Expense | 287762.05 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Profit | -1352379.63 | 2024-01-29 |\n\n### Extracting the Required Values\nBased on the above understanding:\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: This is the first item we need. From the table, it's `463643.51`.\n2. **Depreciation**: Next is depreciation, which is `45745.79`.\n3. **Financial Expenses**: Then, financial expenses are `549407.19`.\n4. **Tax Expense**: Finally, tax expense is `287762.05`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking at the example provided:\n\n- Selling Expenses: `493854.67` (value1)\n- Depreciation: `45751.41` (value2)\n- Financial Expenses: `432511.69` (value3)\n- Tax Expense: `271550.92` (value4)\n\nThis confirms that the order is:\n1. Selling Expenses\n2. Depreciation\n3. Financial Expenses\n4. Tax Expense\n\n### Final Answer\nFollowing the same order for our problem:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '463643.51', 'value2': '45745.79', 'value3': '549407.19', 'value4': '287762.05'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Identify Selling Expenses**: Found as \"Selling Expenses\" in the table with amount `463643.51`.\n2. **Identify Depreciation**: Found as \"Depreciation\" with amount `45745.79`.\n3. **Identify Financial Expenses**: Found as \"Financial Expenses\" with amount `549407.19`.\n4. **Identify Tax Expense**: Found as \"Tax Expense\" with amount `287762.05`.\n5. **Order the Values**: Followed the same order as in the example (Selling, Depreciation, Financial, Tax).\n6. **Construct the JSON**: Placed the values in the correct order within the JSON structure.\n\nThis method ensures that we accurately identify and extract the required line items in the correct sequence.",
