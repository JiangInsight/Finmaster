This involves looking for the \"Taxes Payable\" line item, which represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - In the balance sheet provided, we look for the account labeled \"Taxes Payable\". This account typically represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value and Date**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value and Date**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is `287762.05` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-29`.\n\n4. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00`.\n   - The end value is `287762.05`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '287762.05'} }\n```",
