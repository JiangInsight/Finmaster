This line item is typically called \"Gross Profit,\" which is calculated as Total Revenue minus Cost of Goods Sold (or Total Cost).\n\nLet's look at the given problem:\n\n1. **Total Revenue**: 5,755,241.17\n2. **Total Cost (Cost of Goods Sold)**: 4,680,000.00\n3. **Gross Profit**: 1,075,241.17 (which is 5,755,241.17 - 4,680,000.00)\n\nThe value we are looking for is the Gross Profit, which is already provided in the income statement. \n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1075241.17'}}\n```",
