These items are typically categorized as \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: \n   - The line item \"Fixed Assets\" represents tangible items held for use in production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes. This is the primary item we are interested in.\n   - \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is related to fixed assets but represents the depreciation over time, not the tangible value itself. Therefore, we will not include it in our solution.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, the \"Fixed Assets\" line item has:\n     - Initial_amount: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 5480116.37 (as of 2024-01-29)\n\n3. **Verify Other Line Items**:\n   - Other line items like \"Cash on Hand,\" \"Bank Deposits,\" \"Inventory,\" etc., are either current assets or non-tangible items and do not fit the criteria for tangible items held for production or administrative purposes.\n\n4. **Final Values**:\n   - The initial value of fixed assets is 5000000.00.\n   - The end value of fixed assets is 5480116.37.\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5480116.37'} }\n```",
