These are typically the non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are long-term assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or the operating cycle of the business. In the given balance sheet, the non-current assets are represented by \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" and their total is given as \"Total Non-current Assets.\"\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is the \"Initial_amount\" under \"Total Non-current Assets\" at the \"Initial_date\" (2023-12-31). In this case, it is \"5000000.00.\"\n   - The end value of non-current assets is the \"End_amount\" under \"Total Non-current Assets\" at the \"End_date\" (2024-01-29). In this case, it is \"5434370.58.\"\n\n3. **Verify the Line Items**:\n   - The line items contributing to the total non-current assets are \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation.\" The initial and end values for these items are:\n     - Fixed Assets: Initial = \"5000000.00,\" End = \"5480116.37.\"\n     - Accumulated Depreciation: Initial = \"0.00,\" End = \"-45745.79.\"\n   - The net value of non-current assets at the end is calculated as:\n     - Fixed Assets (5480116.37) - Accumulated Depreciation (45745.79) = 5434370.58, which matches the \"Total Non-current Assets\" end value.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is \"5000000.00.\"\n   - The end value of non-current assets is \"5434370.58.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5434370.58'} }\n```",
