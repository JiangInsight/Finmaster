I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nFirst, let's understand what the task is asking. We're given a cash flow statement, and we need to:\n\n1. **Identify and extract** the specific line item that represents the \"net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents and the receipt of interest and dividends.\"\n\n   - This is essentially describing \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\" More specifically, the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" line item.\n\n2. **Decompose this item into 1 component sub-item**, which must also come from the cash flow statement.\n\n   - Looking at the example, the sub-item was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is a component that contributes to the \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n\n3. **Output the final value** of the main item and its sub-item.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nNow, let's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n```\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Profit  | -1352379.63 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Depreciation  | 45745.79 | 2024-01-29 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -1604015.21 | 2024-01-29 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -1225.71 | 2024-01-29 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -5550000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 450000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 287762.05 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -7724112.71 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 480116.37 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -480116.37 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Ending Balance  | -204229.08 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Increase  | -8204229.08 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\n\nFrom this:\n\n1. **Main Item**: \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is `-480116.37`.\n   \n   - This is the net amount generated from investing activities, which includes acquisitions and disposals of long-term assets (like fixed assets) and other investments, and also receipts like interest and dividends. Here, it seems the only activity is the purchase of fixed assets, leading to a negative cash flow (cash outflow).\n\n2. **Sub-Item**: The only component listed under investing activities is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of `480116.37`.\n\n   - This is a cash outflow (hence the positive amount in the statement, but it's subtracted in the net calculation, leading to the negative net cash flow).\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the example provided:\n\n```\n{\"problem\": ... \"Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 305354.43 | 2024-01-30 | ... \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -305354.43 | 2024-01-30 | ...}\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-305354.43', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '305354.43'}}}\n```\n\nThis matches our understanding:\n\n- Main item (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities): `-305354.43`\n- Sub-item (Purchase of Fixed Assets): `305354.43`\n\n### Constructing the Solution\n\nApplying the same logic to our problem:\n\n- Main item: \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" = `-480116.37`\n- Sub-item: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = `480116.37`\n\nThe JSON format requires:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '______', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '______'} }\n```\n\nBut looking at the example, it was:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-305354.43', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '305354.43'}}}\n```\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy in the expected format. The instruction says to present in the following json format with `sub_items_sub_item value`, but the example shows `sub_items` as a nested dictionary with `sub_item value`.\n\nAssuming the instruction has a typo and the correct format is like the example, I'll proceed with:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-480116.37', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '480116.37'}}}\n```\n\nBut if strictly following the instruction's format with `sub_items_sub_item value`, it would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-480116.37', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '480116.37'}}\n```\n\nGiven that the example's format is likely correct, I'll go with the nested dictionary approach.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-480116.37', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '480116.37'}}}\n```",
