I'm going to break it down to understand what each part is asking for and then extract the necessary information from the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities**: This is the cash flow from the entity's principal revenue-producing activities and other activities that are not investing or financing. This should be found in the **Cash Flow Statement**.\n\n2. **Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid**: This refers to the taxes that the company owes but hasn't paid yet. This is typically listed under \"Taxes Payable\" in the **Balance Sheet**.\n\n3. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This is the total revenue generated from the company's main operations. This is usually the \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue\" in the **Income Statement**.\n\nThe order of extraction is important: first from the Balance Sheet, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each statement one by one.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we're interested in \"Taxes Payable\":\n\n```\n| Taxes Payable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 287762.05 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\n\nThe \"End_amount\" for Taxes Payable is `287762.05`. This is our first value (`value1`).\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNext, from the Income Statement, we need \"Total income arising from ordinary activities\". The closest match is \"Total Revenue\":\n\n```\n| Total Revenue | 5755241.17 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\n\nAlternatively, \"Main Business Revenue\" is also given as `5755241.17`, which is the same as Total Revenue in this case. So, `value2` is `5755241.17`.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, from the Cash Flow Statement, we need the \"Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities\". This is typically labeled as \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\":\n\n```\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -7724112.71 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\n\nSo, `value3` is `-7724112.71`.\n\n### Verifying the Values\n\nLet's double-check each:\n\n1. **Taxes Payable (Balance Sheet)**: `287762.05` - Correct.\n2. **Total Revenue (Income Statement)**: `5755241.17` - Correct.\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (Cash Flow Statement)**: `-7724112.71` - Correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '287762.05', 'value2': '5755241.17', 'value3': '-7724112.71'}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**: Located \"Taxes Payable\" with end amount `287762.05` → `value1`.\n2. **Income Statement**: Located \"Total Revenue\" as `5755241.17` → `value2`.\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**: Located \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" as `-7724112.71` → `value3`.\n4. Combined these into the specified JSON format.\n\nThis matches the example provided where the three values were extracted in the same order from their respective statements.",
