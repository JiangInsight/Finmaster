Common expense-related items in the balance sheet include \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which reflects the depreciation expense accumulated over time.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Line Item**: In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is present. This is directly related to the depreciation expense in the profit or loss statement.\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `0.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - **End Value**: The \"End_amount\" for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `45745.79` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-29`.\n\n4. **Verify**: The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is the only expense-related item in the balance sheet, and its values are clearly provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45745.79'} }\n```",
