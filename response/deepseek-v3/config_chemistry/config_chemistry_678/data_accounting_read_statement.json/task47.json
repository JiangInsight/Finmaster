                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line items and value of the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, along with the relevant financial data involved in the calculation. Additionally, we need to decompose this item into two component sub-items, both of which must originate from the input statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents:**\n   - From the given cash flow statement, the line item \"Net Increase\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" shows the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period. The value is \"-8204229.08\".\n\n2. **Identify the Two Sub-Items:**\n   - The net increase in cash and cash equivalents is calculated as the difference between the ending balance and the beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents. Therefore, the two sub-items are:\n     - **Beginning Balance:** The starting amount of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period. The value is \"8000000.00\".\n     - **Ending Balance:** The ending amount of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period. The value is \"-204229.08\".\n\n3. **Verify the Calculation:**\n   - The net increase should be equal to the ending balance minus the beginning balance.\n   - Calculation: -204229.08 (Ending Balance) - 8000000.00 (Beginning Balance) = -8204229.08 (Net Increase), which matches the given value.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"-8204229.08\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value1\": \"8000000.00\", \"sub_item value2\": \"-204229.08\"}}}\n```",
