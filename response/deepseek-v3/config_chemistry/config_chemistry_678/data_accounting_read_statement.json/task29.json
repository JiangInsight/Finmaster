Additionally, we need to decompose this item into 1 component sub-item, all of which must also originate from the input statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Total Income (Total Revenue):**\n   - From the given income statement, the line item \"Total Revenue\" represents the total income arising from the entity’s ordinary activities. \n   - The value for \"Total Revenue\" is `5755241.17`.\n\n2. **Identify Constituent Line Items:**\n   - The constituent line item for \"Total Revenue\" is \"Main Business Revenue,\" which is the only sub-item listed under \"Total Revenue.\"\n   - The value for \"Main Business Revenue\" is `5755241.17`.\n\n3. **Decompose Total Revenue into 1 Sub-Item:**\n   - The sub-item is \"Main Business Revenue,\" and its value is `5755241.17`.\n\n4. **Output the Solution:**\n   - The solution should include the value of \"Total Revenue\" and the value of its sub-item \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"5755241.17\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"5755241.17\"}}}\n```",
