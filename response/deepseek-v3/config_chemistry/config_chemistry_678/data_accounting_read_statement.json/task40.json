                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify the specific line item in the cash flow statement that represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period. This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task is to find the value that represents the increase in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. This is directly related to the \"Accounts Payable\" line in the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, look for the line item that mentions \"Accounts Payable\". In this case, it is \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is the amount by which the accounts payable has increased during the period. In the given problem, this value is \"450000.00\".\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: Ensure that this line item is indeed under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, which it is. The positive value indicates an increase in accounts payable, meaning the entity owes more for goods or services purchased on credit.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The value to be extracted is \"450000.00\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '450000.00'} }\n```",
