These costs are typically categorized under \"Selling Expenses\" in an income statement. Selling expenses include costs like advertising, sales commissions, shipping, and other expenses directly tied to selling activities.\n\n2. **Reviewing the Income Statement**: Looking at the provided income statement, we can see the following line items under expenses:\n   - Administrative Expenses\n   - Selling Expenses\n   - Depreciation\n   - Financial Expenses\n\n3. **Identifying the Correct Line Item**: \n   - \"Selling Expenses\" is the line item that matches the description of costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n   - The value for \"Selling Expenses\" in the given problem is **463643.51**.\n\n4. **Verification**: \n   - Administrative Expenses are related to general management and not directly tied to sales.\n   - Depreciation is a non-cash expense related to asset usage.\n   - Financial Expenses are related to interest and other financing activities.\n   - Therefore, \"Selling Expenses\" is the correct choice.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '463643.51'}}\n```",
