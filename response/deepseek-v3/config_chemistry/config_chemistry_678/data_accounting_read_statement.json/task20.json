COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of materials and labor.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is present with an amount of \"4680000.00\" for the date \"2024-01-29.\"\n\n3. **Verify the Line Item**: The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is the correct line item to represent the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period. This is confirmed by accounting standards and common financial reporting practices.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"4680000.00.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '4680000.00'} }\n```",
