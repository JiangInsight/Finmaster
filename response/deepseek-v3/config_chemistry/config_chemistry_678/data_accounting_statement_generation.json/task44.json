These transactions represent the purchase of fixed assets.\n   - In the provided data, there is one such transaction with the ID `FixedAsset20231231001` and the type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\".\n\n2. **Extract the Amount**:\n   - The amount for this transaction is listed as `480116.37`.\n\n3. **Verify Payment Status**:\n   - The payment status for this transaction is \"Paid\", which means the amount should be included in the cash flow statement.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Purchase of Fixed Assets**:\n   - Since there is only one fixed assets purchase transaction, the total purchase of fixed assets is simply the amount of that transaction, which is `480116.37`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '480116.37'}}\n```",
