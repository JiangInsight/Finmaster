The initial cash deposit is 3,000,000.0.\n2. The initial bank deposit is 5,000,000.0.\n\nThe beginning balance is the sum of these two amounts, as they represent the initial cash and cash equivalents available at the start of the period.\n\nLet's calculate it step by step:\n\n1. Initial Cash Deposit: 3,000,000.0\n2. Initial Bank Deposit: 5,000,000.0\n3. Total Beginning Balance = 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 8,000,000.0\n\nThe fixed assets and other transactions are not part of the beginning cash and cash equivalents balance, as they are either non-cash items or transactions that occur after the beginning of the period.\n\nTherefore, the beginning balance is 8,000,000.00.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
