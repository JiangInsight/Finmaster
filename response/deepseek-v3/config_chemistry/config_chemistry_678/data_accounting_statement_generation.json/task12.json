Accounts payable represents the amounts owed to suppliers for purchases made on credit (i.e., unpaid purchases).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Accounts Payable:**\n   - The initial accounts payable is the amount owed to suppliers at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31).\n   - From the transactions, we look for purchases where the `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" and the `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\".\n   - In the given data, there is only one such transaction:\n     - `Purchase20231231003`: Amount = 450,000.00, Unpaid, Account Payable.\n   - Therefore, the initial accounts payable is **450,000.00**.\n\n2. **Identify Additional Unpaid Purchases During the Period:**\n   - We need to check if there are any other purchases made during the period (from 2024-01-01 to 2024-01-29) that are unpaid and should be added to accounts payable.\n   - From the transactions, there are no additional unpaid purchases during the period. All other purchases are either paid or do not specify \"Account Payable\" as the payment method.\n\n3. **Calculate Final Accounts Payable:**\n   - The final accounts payable is the sum of the initial accounts payable and any additional unpaid purchases during the period.\n   - Since there are no additional unpaid purchases, the final accounts payable remains **450,000.00**.\n\n4. **Format the Solution:**\n   - The initial and final accounts payable values should be formatted as strings with two decimal places.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '450000.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '450000.00'} }\n```",
