Depreciation is typically recorded as an expense in the income statement and is listed under transactions with the type \"Depreciation\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Depreciation Transactions**: \n   - Look through the transactions data for entries where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\".\n   - In the provided data, there is one such transaction with the ID \"Depreciation20240101001\".\n\n2. **Extract the Depreciation Amount**:\n   - For the transaction \"Depreciation20240101001\", the \"amount\" and \"recorded_amount\" are both \"45745.79\".\n\n3. **Verify the Data**:\n   - Ensure that there are no other depreciation transactions in the dataset. A quick scan confirms that \"Depreciation20240101001\" is the only entry with this type.\n\n4. **Prepare the Solution**:\n   - The depreciation amount to be reported in the income statement is \"45745.79\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45745.79'} }\n```",
