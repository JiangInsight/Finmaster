This suggests that the end value is simply the initial value plus any fixed assets purchases, without accounting for depreciation. Therefore, we will follow the same approach here.\n\n### Final Calculation:\n- Fixed Assets Initial Value: 5,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets End Value: 5,000,000.00 + 480,116.37 = 5,480,116.37\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '5480116.37'} }\n```",
