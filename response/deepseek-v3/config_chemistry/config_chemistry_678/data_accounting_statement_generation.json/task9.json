Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Fixed Assets Value**: \n   - Look for transactions with type \"Fixed Assets\" or \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" that are dated on or before the initial date (2023-12-31).\n   - In the given data, there is a transaction with type \"Fixed Assets\" on 2023-12-31 with an amount of 5,000,000.0.\n   - There is also a transaction with type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" on 2023-12-31 with an amount of 480,116.37.\n   - The initial fixed assets value is the sum of these two amounts: 5,000,000.0 + 480,116.37 = 5,480,116.37.\n\n2. **Calculate Depreciation**:\n   - Look for transactions with type \"Depreciation\". In the given data, there is one such transaction on 2024-01-01 with an amount of 45,745.79.\n   - This amount should be subtracted from the initial fixed assets value to get the net fixed assets value.\n\n3. **Calculate Final Fixed Assets Value**:\n   - Subtract the depreciation from the initial fixed assets value: 5,480,116.37 - 45,745.79 = 5,434,370.58.\n\n4. **Format the Results**:\n   - The initial value is 5,480,116.37, formatted as '5480116.37'.\n   - The end value is 5,434,370.58, formatted as '5434370.58'.\n\nHere is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'fixed assets net Initial Value': '5480116.37', 'fixed assets net End Value': '5434370.58'} }\n```",
