Current liabilities typically include short-term obligations such as accounts payable, short-term loans, and other debts due within one year.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Current Liabilities:**\n   - The initial current liabilities are the unpaid purchase transactions recorded on 2023-12-31.\n   - From the data, there is one unpaid purchase transaction on 2023-12-31:\n     - `Purchase20231231003`: Amount = 450,000.0, Payment Status = Unpaid, Payment Method = Account Payable.\n\n2. **Calculate Initial Current Liabilities:**\n   - The initial current liabilities are simply the amount of the unpaid purchase:\n     - Initial Current Liabilities = 450,000.0.\n\n3. **Identify Final Current Liabilities:**\n   - The final current liabilities include any unpaid purchase transactions and any other short-term obligations.\n   - From the data, there is one unpaid purchase transaction on 2023-12-31:\n     - `Purchase20231231003`: Amount = 450,000.0, Payment Status = Unpaid, Payment Method = Account Payable.\n   - Additionally, there are unpaid interest receivables, but these are assets, not liabilities, so they are not included in current liabilities.\n\n4. **Calculate Final Current Liabilities:**\n   - The final current liabilities are the same as the initial current liabilities since no additional unpaid liabilities were incurred during the period:\n     - Final Current Liabilities = 450,000.0.\n\n5. **Format the Solution:**\n   - The initial and final current liabilities are both 450,000.0.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '450000.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '450000.00'} }\n```",
