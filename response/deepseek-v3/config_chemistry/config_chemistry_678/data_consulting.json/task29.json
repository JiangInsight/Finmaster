                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 737,762.05\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 11,647,620.37\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 737,762.05 / 11,647,620.37 ≈ 0.0633\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** Net Profit / Total Revenue\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** -1,352,379.63\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,755,241.17\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = -1,352,379.63 / 5,755,241.17 ≈ -0.2349 or -23.49%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** Net Profit / Average Total Assets\n\nFirst, we need Average Total Assets. Since we only have the ending total assets (because initial is same as ending for the period), we'll use:\nAverage Total Assets = (Initial Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2\nInitial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\nEnding Total Assets = 12,385,382.42\n\nAverage Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 12,385,382.42) / 2 = 12,692,691.21\n\nNet Profit = -1,352,379.63\n\nCalculation:\nROA = -1,352,379.63 / 12,692,691.21 ≈ -0.1065 or -10.65%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales), we'll use Total Revenue as Net Credit Sales = 5,755,241.17\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable:\nInitial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\nEnding Accounts Receivable = 1,604,015.21\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,604,015.21) / 2 = 802,007.605\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,755,241.17 / 802,007.605 ≈ 7.176\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '-23.49%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-10.65%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.18'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check each calculation quickly.\n\n1. Debt to Equity: 737,762 / 11,647,620 ≈ 0.063 → Correct.\n2. Net Profit Margin: -1,352,379 / 5,755,241 ≈ -0.2349 → -23.49% → Correct.\n3. ROA: -1,352,379 / 12,692,691 ≈ -0.1065 → -10.65% → Correct.\n4. AR Turnover: 5,755,241 / 802,008 ≈ 7.176 → Rounded to 7.18 → Correct.\n\nEverything checks out!",
