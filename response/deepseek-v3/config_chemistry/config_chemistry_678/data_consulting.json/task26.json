                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. I'll go through each one, explaining how to compute them based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n**Definition:** ROE measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -1,352,379.63 (a loss)\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount column):\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,647,620.37\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{-1,352,379.63}{11,647,620.37} \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating the division first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,352,379.63}{11,647,620.37} \\approx -0.1161 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ -0.1161 \\times 100 \\approx -11.61\\% \\]\n\nSo, ROE is approximately -11.61%.\n\n### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed through debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet (End_amount column):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n- Total Assets = 12,385,382.42\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{737,762.05}{12,385,382.42} \\]\n\n\\[ \\approx 0.0596 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.06.\n\n### 3. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 1,075,241.17\n- Total Revenue = 5,755,241.17\n\nNow, calculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{1,075,241.17}{5,755,241.17} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,075,241.17}{5,755,241.17} \\approx 0.1868 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100:\n\n\\[ 0.1868 \\times 100 \\approx 18.68\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 18.68%.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated values into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-11.61%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Gross Profit Margin': '18.68%'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **ROE:**\n   - Net Profit: -1,352,379.63\n   - Equity: 11,647,620.37\n   - -1,352,379.63 / 11,647,620.37 ≈ -0.1161 → -11.61% ✔\n\n2. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - Total Liabilities: 737,762.05\n   - Total Assets: 12,385,382.42\n   - 737,762.05 / 12,385,382.42 ≈ 0.0596 → 0.06 ✔\n\n3. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: 1,075,241.17\n   - Revenue: 5,755,241.17\n   - 1,075,241.17 / 5,755,241.17 ≈ 0.1868 → 18.68% ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The calculations are correct based on the provided financial statements.",
