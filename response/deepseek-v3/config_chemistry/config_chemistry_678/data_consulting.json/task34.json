                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how I arrive at the numbers. \n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7,724,112.71\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n\nCalculation:\n- -7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 ≈ -10.47\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05 (this is the only liability listed, so total debt is this)\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,647,620.37\n\nCalculation:\n- 737,762.05 / 11,647,620.37 ≈ 0.063 or 0.06 (rounded)\n\nWait, is Total Debt just Current Liabilities here? Typically, Debt includes both current and non-current liabilities, but in this balance sheet, there are no non-current liabilities listed. So, total debt is just current liabilities.\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 5,755,241.17\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 12,385,382.42\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial + End) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 12,385,382.42) / 2 ≈ 12,692,691.21\n\nCalculation:\n- 5,755,241.17 / 12,692,691.21 ≈ 0.45\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 6,951,011.84\n- Inventory = 5,550,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n\nCalculation:\n- (6,951,011.84 - 5,550,000) / 737,762.05 = 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis seems identical to the first ratio. Maybe it's a different name for the same thing? \n\nFrom earlier:\n- Operating Cash Flow = -7,724,112.71\n- Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n- Ratio = -10.47\n\nUnless there's a different interpretation, it's the same as the first ratio.\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = -1,352,379.63\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Owner's Equity = 11,647,620.37\n- Average Equity = (13,000,000 + 11,647,620.37) / 2 ≈ 12,323,810.19\n\nCalculation:\n- -1,352,379.63 / 12,323,810.19 ≈ -0.1097 or -10.97%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since we don't have info on cash vs credit sales):\n- Net Sales = 5,755,241.17\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 1,604,015.21\n- Average AR = (0 + 1,604,015.21) / 2 = 802,007.605\n\nCalculation:\n- 5,755,241.17 / 802,007.605 ≈ 7.18\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-10.47', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.45', 'Quick Ratio': '1.90', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-10.47', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-10.97%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.18'}}\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me double-check some calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Quick Ratio**: (6,951,011.84 - 5,550,000) = 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90 (correct)\n2. **Total Asset Turnover**: 5,755,241.17 / 12,692,691.21 ≈ 0.453 (rounds to 0.45)\n3. **AR Turnover**: 5,755,241.17 / 802,007.605 ≈ 7.175 (rounds to 7.18)\n4. **ROE**: -1,352,379.63 / 12,323,810.19 ≈ -0.1097 (-10.97%)\n5. **Debt to Equity**: 737,762.05 / 11,647,620.37 ≈ 0.063 (rounds to 0.06)\n6. **Operating Cash Flow ratios**: Both are -7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 ≈ -10.47\n\nEverything checks out! \n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-10.47', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.45', 'Quick Ratio': '1.90', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-10.47', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-10.97%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.18'}}\n```",
