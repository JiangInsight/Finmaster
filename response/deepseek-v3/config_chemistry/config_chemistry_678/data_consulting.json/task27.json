                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one to ensure I understand how to compute them correctly based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures how much cash flow is generated from operating activities relative to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7,724,112.71\n- Net Profit = -1,352,379.63\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-7,724,112.71}{-1,352,379.63} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-7,724,112.71}{-1,352,379.63} \\approx 5.71 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is approximately 5.71.\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the ratio was positive even though both numbers were negative. That makes sense because dividing two negatives gives a positive. So, 5.71 seems correct.\n\n### 2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition**: This ratio indicates how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the average current assets. Average current assets is typically the average of the beginning and ending current assets.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Current Assets (2023-12-31) = 8,000,000.00\n- End Current Assets (2024-01-29) = 6,951,011.84\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{8,000,000.00 + 6,951,011.84}{2} = \\frac{14,951,011.84}{2} = 7,475,505.92 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue = 5,755,241.17\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{5,755,241.17}{7,475,505.92} \\approx 0.77 \\]\n\nSo, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio is approximately 0.77.\n\n*Checking the example*, their ratio was 0.68, which is similar in magnitude, so 0.77 seems reasonable.\n\n### 3. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n\n**Definition**: This ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable\n  - From the balance sheet:\n    - Cash on Hand (End) = -206,636.07\n    - Bank Deposits (End) = 2,406.99\n    - Interest Receivable = 1,225.71\n    - Accounts Receivable = 1,604,015.21\n  - So, Quick Assets = -206,636.07 + 2,406.99 + 1,225.71 + 1,604,015.21\n    - Let's add step by step:\n      - -206,636.07 + 2,406.99 = -204,229.08\n      - -204,229.08 + 1,225.71 = -203,003.37\n      - -203,003.37 + 1,604,015.21 = 1,401,011.84\n- Current Liabilities (End) = 737,762.05\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{1,401,011.84}{737,762.05} \\approx 1.90 \\]\n\nSo, the Quick Ratio is approximately 1.90.\n\n*Wait*, in the example, the quick ratio was 1.54. Let me double-check my calculation for quick assets.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand: -206,636.07\n- Bank Deposits: 2,406.99\n- Interest Receivable: 1,225.71\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,604,015.21\n\nQuick Assets typically exclude inventory and prepaid expenses, so it's Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable. Here, Bank Deposits can be considered cash equivalents, and Interest Receivable is also a current asset that's usually included in quick assets.\n\nAdding them:\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents: -206,636.07 + 2,406.99 = -204,229.08\n- Add Interest Receivable: -204,229.08 + 1,225.71 = -203,003.37\n- Add Accounts Receivable: -203,003.37 + 1,604,015.21 = 1,401,011.84\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 737,762.05\n\nSo, 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90\n\nHmm, the example had a lower quick ratio, but their quick assets might have been lower relative to liabilities. Maybe their cash was positive. Here, negative cash is reducing quick assets, but still, the ratio is higher. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe Interest Receivable is not typically included in quick assets? Quick assets are usually cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Interest receivable might be excluded. Let's try excluding it:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= -206,636.07 + 2,406.99 + 1,604,015.21\n= (-206,636.07 + 2,406.99) = -204,229.08\n+ 1,604,015.21 = 1,399,786.13\n\nThen Quick Ratio = 1,399,786.13 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90\n\nStill the same because interest receivable was negligible. Maybe the example had higher current liabilities relative to quick assets.\n\nGiven that, I think 1.90 is correct based on the numbers.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating all three ratios:\n\n1. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: 5.71\n2. Current Assets Turnover Ratio: 0.77\n3. Quick Ratio: 1.90\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '5.71', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.77', 'Quick Ratio': '1.90'}}\n```\n\n*Double-checking the calculations to ensure no mistakes:*\n\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income: -7,724,112.71 / -1,352,379.63 = 5.71 (correct)\n- Current Assets Turnover: 5,755,241.17 / 7,475,505.92 ≈ 0.77 (correct)\n- Quick Ratio: (1,604,015.21 + 2,406.99 - 206,636.07) / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out!",
