                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Net Profit Margin is. From what I recall, the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows what percentage of a company's revenue is actual profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. \n\nThe formula for Net Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSo, to find the Net Profit Margin, I need two numbers:\n1. Net Profit\n2. Total Revenue\n\n### Identifying the Numbers from the Given Data\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n1. **Net Profit**: \n   - The table lists \"Net Profit\" as -1,352,379.63 (negative value).\n   \n2. **Total Revenue**: \n   - The table lists \"Total Revenue\" as 5,755,241.17.\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\n\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,352,379.63}{5,755,241.17} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide the Net Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,352,379.63}{5,755,241.17} \\approx -0.2349 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ -0.2349 \\times 100 \\approx -23.49\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nLet me double-check the calculation to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Divide -1,352,379.63 by 5,755,241.17:\n   - -1,352,379.63 ÷ 5,755,241.17 ≈ -0.2349\n\n2. Multiply by 100:\n   - -0.2349 × 100 = -23.49%\n\nSeems correct.\n\n### Considering the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example to ensure I'm doing it right:\n\n- Example's Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Example's Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Calculated Net Profit Margin: (-1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59) × 100 ≈ -30.29%\n\nThis matches the given solution of -30.29%, so my method seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nFor the given problem:\n\n- Net Profit: -1,352,379.63\n- Total Revenue: 5,755,241.17\n- Net Profit Margin: (-1,352,379.63 / 5,755,241.17) × 100 ≈ -23.49%\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is -23.49%.\n\n### Formatting the Answer\n\nThe answer should be presented in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '-23.49%'}}\n```",
