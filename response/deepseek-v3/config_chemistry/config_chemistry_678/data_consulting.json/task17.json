                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio** based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is. From what I recall, this ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nA higher ratio indicates that the company is more capable of covering its debt with its cash flow, which is a good sign of financial health.\n\n### Identifying the Components\n\nFrom the formula, I need two main pieces of information:\n1. **Operating Cash Flow**: This should be the net cash flow from operating activities.\n2. **Total Debt**: This would typically be the total liabilities of the company.\n\nLet's find these in the provided financial statements.\n\n#### 1. Operating Cash Flow\n\nLooking at the **cash flow statement**, there's a line item called \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\". \n\nFrom the problem:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,724,112.71\n\nSo, Operating Cash Flow = -7,724,112.71\n\n#### 2. Total Debt\n\nNow, for total debt, I need to look at the **balance sheet**. Total debt is usually the sum of all liabilities. \n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 737,762.05\n- There's no mention of long-term liabilities (like long-term debt), only current liabilities are listed under liabilities.\n\nSo, Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Usually, total debt includes both current and long-term liabilities. But in this balance sheet, under liabilities, only \"Total Current Liabilities\" is listed, and there's no separate line for long-term liabilities. \n\nLooking at the \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\", it's 12,385,382.42, and Total Owner's Equity is 11,647,620.37. \n\nTotal Liabilities = Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity - Total Owner's Equity\n= 12,385,382.42 - 11,647,620.37\n= 737,762.05\n\nThis matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\". So, it seems there are no long-term liabilities; all liabilities are current. \n\nTherefore, Total Debt = 737,762.05\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, plug these into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{-7,724,112.71}{737,762.05} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n- 7,724,112.71 ÷ 737,762.05 ≈ 10.47\n\nBut since the numerator is negative, the ratio is negative:\n\n≈ -10.47\n\nWait, in the example provided, the ratio was -3.90, and it was presented with two decimal places. Maybe we should keep two decimal places here as well.\n\nSo, -10.468... rounds to -10.47.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculation to ensure no mistake.\n\nCalculating more precisely:\n\n7,724,112.71 ÷ 737,762.05 ≈ 10.468\n\nSo, -10.47 seems correct.\n\nBut in the example, the ratio was -3.90, which is less than our -10.47 in magnitude. Maybe the example had higher total debt relative to operating cash flow.\n\n### Verifying the Approach\n\nIs this the correct way to calculate the ratio? \n\nI think so. The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is indeed Operating Cash Flow divided by Total Debt. \n\nBut sometimes, \"Total Debt\" might refer to interest-bearing debt, not all liabilities. In this case, the only liabilities are Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable, which are part of current liabilities. \n\nAccounts Payable: 450,000.00\nTaxes Payable: 287,762.05\nTotal Current Liabilities: 737,762.05\n\nNeither of these is typically considered \"debt\" in the sense of loans or borrowings. \n\nHmm, maybe the \"Total Debt\" here is zero because there are no actual debt items like loans or bonds payable. \n\nBut then the ratio would be undefined (division by zero), which doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we consider all liabilities as debt for this ratio, even if they're not interest-bearing. \n\nGiven that, and since the example seems to have done that (their total current liabilities were 1,861,550.92, and they used that as debt), it's probably correct to use total current liabilities here as total debt.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nOperating Cash Flow: -7,724,112.71\nTotal Debt (Total Current Liabilities): 737,762.05\n\nRatio: -7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 ≈ -10.47\n\n### Presenting the Answer\n\nThe solution should be in the given JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-10.47'} }\n```\n\n### Cross-Checking with the Example\n\nIn the example:\n- Operating Cash Flow: -7,259,994.10\n- Total Debt (Total Current Liabilities): 1,861,550.92\n- Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ -3.90\n\nThis matches their provided solution, confirming that they used total current liabilities as total debt. \n\nSimilarly, in our problem, using total current liabilities as total debt gives us -10.47.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully going through the financial statements and understanding the components needed for the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, the calculation is straightforward. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-10.47'} }\n```",
