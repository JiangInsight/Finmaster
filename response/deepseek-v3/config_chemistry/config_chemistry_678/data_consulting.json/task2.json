                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Quick Ratio based on the given balance sheet data. \n\n### Understanding the Quick Ratio\nFirst, I recall that the Quick Ratio (also known as the Acid-Test Ratio) is a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Quick Assets** typically include:\n1. Cash and cash equivalents\n2. Marketable securities (if any)\n3. Accounts receivable\n4. Other short-term receivables\n\n**Excluded from Quick Assets**:\n- Inventory (because it's not as liquid)\n- Prepaid expenses (not mentioned here, but good to know)\n\n**Current Liabilities** are the obligations due within one year, which in this case are given as \"Total Current Liabilities.\"\n\n### Identifying the Relevant Data from the Balance Sheet\nLooking at the provided balance sheet as of the end date (2024-01-29), here are the relevant accounts and their amounts:\n\n1. **Cash on Hand**: -206,636.07\n   - Wait, cash is negative? That seems unusual. Maybe it's a typo or the company is overdrawn.\n   \n2. **Bank Deposits**: 2,406.99\n   - This is positive and likely part of cash equivalents.\n   \n3. **Interest Receivable**: 1,225.71\n   - This is a short-term receivable, so it's part of quick assets.\n   \n4. **Accounts Receivable**: 1,604,015.21\n   - Definitely part of quick assets.\n   \n5. **Inventory**: 5,550,000.00\n   - Not part of quick assets, so we exclude this.\n   \n6. **Total Current Liabilities**: 737,762.05\n   - This is our denominator in the Quick Ratio formula.\n\n### Calculating Quick Assets\nNow, let's sum up the quick assets:\n\n- Cash on Hand: -206,636.07\n- Bank Deposits: 2,406.99\n- Interest Receivable: 1,225.71\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,604,015.21\n\nAdding these up:\n\\[ -206,636.07 + 2,406.99 + 1,225.71 + 1,604,015.21 \\]\n\nLet's do the math step by step:\n\n1. -206,636.07 + 2,406.99 = -204,229.08\n2. -204,229.08 + 1,225.71 = -203,003.37\n3. -203,003.37 + 1,604,015.21 = 1,401,011.84\n\nSo, Quick Assets = 1,401,011.84\n\nWait a minute, this seems high compared to the negative cash. Maybe I'm missing something. \n\nLooking back, the \"Total Current Assets\" is 6,951,011.84, which includes inventory (5,550,000). So without inventory, current assets would be 6,951,011.84 - 5,550,000 = 1,401,011.84, which matches our quick assets calculation. That checks out.\n\n### Calculating the Quick Ratio\nNow, the Quick Ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{1,401,011.84}{737,762.05} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n1,401,011.84 ÷ 737,762.05 ≈ 1.899\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 1.90\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake:\n\n- Quick Assets: Cash (-206,636.07) + Bank (2,406.99) + Interest (1,225.71) + AR (1,604,015.21) = 1,401,011.84\n- Current Liabilities: 737,762.05\n- Ratio: 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90\n\nThis seems correct. \n\n### Considering Negative Cash\nThe negative cash is unusual, but it's possible if the company has overdrafts or owes more cash than it has on hand. For the purpose of the quick ratio, we still include it as part of cash, even if it's negative, because it's still a liquid asset (though in reality, negative cash might indicate a problem).\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter carefully calculating, the Quick Ratio is approximately 1.90.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.90'}}\n```",
