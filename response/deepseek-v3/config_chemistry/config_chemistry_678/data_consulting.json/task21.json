                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two things: the Free Cash Flow (FCF) and the Current Assets Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** This is the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. It's an important measure because it shows how efficient a company is at generating cash. Investors often look at FCF to determine how much cash is available for dividends, share buybacks, or expansion.\n\n   The formula for FCF is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures}\n   \\]\n   From the cash flow statement, \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is given, and \"Capital Expenditures\" can be inferred from the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" under investing activities.\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its current assets to generate sales. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2}\n   \\]\n   From the balance sheet, we have the initial and end amounts for Total Current Assets, and from the income statement, we have Total Revenue.\n\n### Calculating Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,724,112.71\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures): 480,116.37\n\nWait a minute, the formula is:\n\\[\n\\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures}\n\\]\nBut in the example provided, the FCF seems to be the \"Net Increase\" in \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" which is -8,204,229.08. That doesn't match the calculation from the formula.\n\nHmm, maybe the FCF is directly the \"Net Increase\" in cash and equivalents. Let me check the example:\n\nIn the example:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -305,354.43\n- Net Increase in Cash: -7,565,348.53\nAnd the FCF given is -7,565,348.53, which matches the net increase.\n\nSo, perhaps FCF is the net change in cash and cash equivalents, which is the sum of operating and investing cash flows (assuming no financing activities affect cash directly here).\n\nSo, in our problem:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,724,112.71\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -480,116.37\n- Total Net Cash Flow: -7,724,112.71 + (-480,116.37) = -8,204,229.08\nWhich matches the \"Net Increase\" in \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\": -8,204,229.08\n\nTherefore, FCF = -8,204,229.08\n\n### Calculating Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue: 5,755,241.17\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Current Assets: 8,000,000.00\n- End Total Current Assets: 6,951,011.84\n\nAverage Current Assets:\n\\[\n\\frac{8,000,000.00 + 6,951,011.84}{2} = \\frac{14,951,011.84}{2} = 7,475,505.92\n\\]\n\nCurrent Assets Turnover Ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{5,755,241.17}{7,475,505.92} \\approx 0.77\n\\]\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure no mistakes.\n\n1. **FCF:**\n   - Operating: -7,724,112.71\n   - Investing: -480,116.37\n   - Sum: -8,204,229.08\n   - Matches net increase in cash: Correct.\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover:**\n   - Revenue: 5,755,241.17\n   - Avg Current Assets: (8,000,000 + 6,951,011.84)/2 = 7,475,505.92\n   - Ratio: 5,755,241.17 / 7,475,505.92 â‰ˆ 0.77\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-8204229.08', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.77'}}\n```",
