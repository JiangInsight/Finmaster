There are no non-current liabilities listed, so the total liabilities are equal to the total current liabilities.\n\n3. **Identify Total Assets**: From the balance sheet, the \"Total Assets\" at the end of the reporting period (2024-01-29) is 12,385,382.42.\n\n4. **Calculate the Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{737,762.05}{12,385,382.42} \\approx 0.0596\n   \\]\n   Rounding to two decimal places, this becomes 0.06.\n\n5. **Present the Answer**: The final answer is formatted as a JSON object with the calculated ratio.\n\nHere is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06'} }\n```",
