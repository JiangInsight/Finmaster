                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio indicates a company's ability to cover its debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \"Total Debt\" can be considered as the \"Total Current Liabilities\" since the balance sheet doesn't show long-term debt separately.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **Income Statement**:\n- **Total Revenue**: 5,755,241.17\n- **Gross Profit**: 1,075,241.17\n\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -7,724,112.71\n\nFrom the **Balance Sheet** (End Amounts):\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 737,762.05\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,075,241.17}{5,755,241.17} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1,075,241.17}{5,755,241.17} \\approx 0.1868\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.1868 \\times 100 \\approx 18.68\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **18.68%**.\n\n### Calculating Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-7,724,112.71}{737,762.05}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-7,724,112.71}{737,762.05} \\approx -10.47\n\\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-10.47**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: 1,075,241.17\n   - Total Revenue: 5,755,241.17\n   - 1,075,241.17 / 5,755,241.17 ≈ 0.1868 → 18.68%\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,724,112.71\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 737,762.05\n   - -7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 ≈ -10.47\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '18.68%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-10.47'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin**: The company retains about 18.68% of its revenue as gross profit after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a measure of production efficiency and pricing strategy.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: A negative value (-10.47) indicates that the company's operating activities are not generating positive cash flow to cover its current liabilities. This could be a sign of financial stress, as the company is spending more cash than it's generating from operations relative to its debt.\n\nThese ratios provide insights into the company's profitability and liquidity positions, which are crucial for financial analysis.",
