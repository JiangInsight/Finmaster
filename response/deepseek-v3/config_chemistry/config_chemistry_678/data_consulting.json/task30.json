                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 6,951,011.84\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 737,762.05\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 6,951,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 9.42\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = -206,636.07\n- Bank Deposits = 2,406.99\n- Interest Receivable = 1,225.71\n- Accounts Receivable = 1,604,015.21\n- Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= -206,636.07 + 2,406.99 + 1,225.71 + 1,604,015.21\n= (-206,636.07 + 2,406.99) = -204,229.08\n-204,229.08 + 1,225.71 = -203,003.37\n-203,003.37 + 1,604,015.21 = 1,401,011.84\n\nQuick Ratio = 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90\n\n*Wait a minute, the cash on hand is negative. That's unusual. Maybe I should exclude it if it's negative? But typically, we include all cash and cash equivalents regardless of sign. Maybe the negative is correct here.*\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 737,762.05\n- Total Assets = 12,385,382.42\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 737,762.05 / 12,385,382.42 ≈ 0.06\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 737,762.05\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,647,620.37\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 737,762.05 / 11,647,620.37 ≈ 0.063\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7,724,112.71\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 737,762.05\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 ≈ -10.47\n\n*This is a very negative ratio, which indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative relative to its debt, which is not good.*\n\n### Verifying Calculations:\nLet me double-check the components, especially the quick ratio since cash on hand is negative.\n\nFor Quick Ratio:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= -206,636.07 + 2,406.99 + 1,225.71 + 1,604,015.21\n= (-206,636.07 + 2,406.99) = -204,229.08\n-204,229.08 + 1,225.71 = -203,003.37\n-203,003.37 + 1,604,015.21 = 1,401,011.84\n\nQuick Ratio = 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90\n\nThis seems correct, even though cash on hand is negative, it's still part of the calculation.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '9.42', 'Quick Ratio': '1.90', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-10.47'}}\n```\n\n*Note: The Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.063, which rounds to 0.06 when keeping two decimal places.*",
