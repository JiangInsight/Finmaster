                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the required ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount): 6,951,011.84\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 737,762.05\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 6,951,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 9.42\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit: 1,075,241.17\n- Total Revenue: 5,755,241.17\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (1,075,241.17 / 5,755,241.17) * 100 ≈ 18.68%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities: This seems to be just the Total Current Liabilities since there's no mention of long-term liabilities. So, 737,762.05\n- Total Assets: 12,385,382.42\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 737,762.05 / 12,385,382.42 ≈ 0.06\n\n*Wait a minute, in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated using Total Current Liabilities as the debt, even though there might be other liabilities not listed. Here, it seems only current liabilities are present, so we'll proceed with that.*\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: -1,352,379.63\n- Total Revenue: 5,755,241.17\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (-1,352,379.63 / 5,755,241.17) * 100 ≈ -23.50%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand: -206,636.07 (negative cash is unusual, but we'll take it as is)\n- Bank Deposits: 2,406.99\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits = -206,636.07 + 2,406.99 = -204,229.08\n- Current Liabilities: 737,762.05\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = -204,229.08 / 737,762.05 ≈ -0.28\n\n*Negative cash is problematic, but the calculation stands as per the data.*\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n**Formula:** Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities + Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,724,112.71\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -480,116.37\n\nCalculation:\nFCF = -7,724,112.71 + (-480,116.37) = -8,204,229.08\n\n*This matches the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents at the bottom of the cash flow statement.*\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:** (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Profit: -1,352,379.63\n- Total Assets (End_amount): 12,385,382.42\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (-1,352,379.63 / 12,385,382.42) * 100 ≈ -10.92%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '9.42', 'Gross Profit Margin': '18.68%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '-23.50%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '-0.28', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-8204229.08', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-10.92%'}}\n```\n\n*Note: Some values like negative cash and high current ratio might indicate unusual financial situations, but the calculations are based on the provided data.*",
