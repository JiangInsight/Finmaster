                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7,724,112.71\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 ≈ -10.47\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Debt\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are:\n- Accounts Payable = 450,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 287,762.05\nTotal Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\nThere are no long-term liabilities mentioned, so Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 ≈ -10.47\n\n*Note: This seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio because total debt equals current liabilities in this case.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 4,680,000.00\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- Ending Inventory = 5,550,000.00\nAverage Inventory = (Initial + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 5,550,000) / 2 = 2,775,000.00\n\nCalculation:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 4,680,000 / 2,775,000 ≈ 1.69\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Debt (Total Current Liabilities) = 737,762.05\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,647,620.37\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 737,762.05 / 11,647,620.37 ≈ 0.063\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 6,951,011.84\n- Inventory = 5,550,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Assets = 6,951,011.84 - 5,550,000.00 = 1,401,011.84\nQuick Ratio = 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 6,951,011.84\n- Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 6,951,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 9.42\n\n### Final Answer\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-10.47', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-10.47', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '1.69', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Quick Ratio': '1.90', 'Current Ratio': '9.42'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify a couple of these to ensure no mistakes.\n\n- **Current Ratio:** 6,951,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 9.42 (correct)\n- **Quick Ratio:** (6,951,011.84 - 5,550,000) / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90 (correct)\n- **Inventory Turnover:** 4,680,000 / 2,775,000 ≈ 1.69 (correct)\n- **Debt to Equity:** 737,762.05 / 11,647,620.37 ≈ 0.063 (rounded to 0.06)\n- **Operating Cash Flow and Cash Flow to Debt:** Both are -10.47 given the same numerator and denominator in this case.\n\nEverything checks out!",
