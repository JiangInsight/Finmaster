                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Equity Ratio\nFirst, what is the Debt to Equity Ratio? It's a financial metric that compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nThis ratio gives an idea about the financial leverage of the company, showing how much debt is used to finance the company's assets relative to the equity.\n\n### Identifying the Components from the Balance Sheet\nFrom the given balance sheet, we need to identify:\n1. **Total Liabilities**: This is usually the sum of all liabilities the company owes. In the balance sheet provided, under the \"End_amount\" column, we have:\n   - Accounts Payable: 450,000.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 287,762.05\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 737,762.05\n\n   It seems that \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the sum of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable, and there are no other liabilities listed (like long-term liabilities). So, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05.\n\n2. **Total Shareholders' Equity**: This is the equity portion of the balance sheet. From the table:\n   - Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.00\n   - Retained Earnings: -1,352,379.63\n   - Total Owner's Equity: 11,647,620.37\n\n   Here, \"Total Owner's Equity\" seems to be the sum of Paid-in Capital and Retained Earnings (13,000,000 - 1,352,379.63 = 11,647,620.37). So, Total Shareholders' Equity = Total Owner's Equity = 11,647,620.37.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{737,762.05}{11,647,620.37} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n737,762.05 ÷ 11,647,620.37 ≈ 0.06334\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives us approximately 0.06.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to ensure I didn't miss anything:\n- Are there any other liabilities not included? The table lists only current liabilities, and no long-term debts are mentioned, so it seems correct.\n- Is the equity calculation correct? Yes, Paid-in Capital + Retained Earnings = Total Owner's Equity.\n- The division seems correct: 737,762 / 11,647,620 ≈ 0.063.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.06.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06'} }\n```",
