                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the necessary components**:\n   - **Net Credit Sales**: This is typically the \"Main Business Revenue\" from the income statement, assuming all sales are on credit. Here, it is 5,755,241.17.\n   - **Average Accounts Receivable**: This is calculated as the average of the beginning and ending accounts receivable. From the balance sheet:\n     - Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial_amount): 0.00\n     - Ending Accounts Receivable (End_amount): 1,604,015.21\n     - Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = (0.00 + 1,604,015.21) / 2 = 802,007.605\n\n2. **Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**:\n   - The formula is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the numbers:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,755,241.17}{802,007.605} \\approx 7.18\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Answer**:\n   - The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is approximately 7.18.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.18'}}\n```",
