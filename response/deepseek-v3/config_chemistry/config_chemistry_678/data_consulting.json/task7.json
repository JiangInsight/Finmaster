However, in the given examples, the solution seems to directly use the \"Net Increase\" value from the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section.\n\n2. **Analyze the Given Problem**:\n   - The \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" is -7,724,112.71.\n   - The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is -480,116.37 (which includes the purchase of fixed assets).\n   - The \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents is -8,204,229.08.\n\n3. **Determine the Approach**:\n   - In the provided example, the solution uses the \"Net Increase\" value directly as the FCF. This suggests that the FCF is being calculated as the total change in cash and cash equivalents, which includes the impact of all activities (operating, investing, and financing). \n   - Therefore, for consistency with the example, we will use the \"Net Increase\" value as the FCF.\n\n4. **Calculate FCF**:\n   - The \"Net Increase\" is -8,204,229.08, so the FCF is -8,204,229.08.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The Free Cash Flow (FCF) is -8,204,229.08.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-8204229.08'} }\n```",
