                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Equity Ratio, the Net Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 737,762.05\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 11,647,620.37\n\nAssuming that \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the only liability (since no long-term liabilities are mentioned), then:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = 737,762.05 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{737,762.05}{11,647,620.37} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{737,762.05}{11,647,620.37} \\approx 0.0633 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.06.\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated using \"Total Current Liabilities\" divided by \"Total Owner's Equity\". Maybe there are no long-term liabilities in this case, so we'll proceed with that.\n\nWait, in the example, the \"Total Current Liabilities\" was 1,861,550.92 and \"Total Owner's Equity\" was 11,354,858.57, giving:\n\n1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.1639, which was rounded to '0.16'.\n\nSimilarly here:\n\n737,762.05 / 11,647,620.37 ≈ 0.0633, so '0.06'.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet shows \"Total Current Liabilities\" and \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\". The latter is the sum of liabilities and equity, so:\n\nTotal Liabilities and Owner's Equity = Total Liabilities + Total Owner's Equity\n12,385,382.42 = Total Liabilities + 11,647,620.37\nTotal Liabilities = 12,385,382.42 - 11,647,620.37 = 737,762.05\n\nSo, it seems \"Total Liabilities\" is indeed just the \"Total Current Liabilities\" of 737,762.05.\n\nThus, Debt to Equity Ratio = 737,762.05 / 11,647,620.37 ≈ 0.0633 or '0.06'.\n\nBut the example had '0.16', which was similarly calculated. Maybe they rounded differently, but 0.0633 is closer to 0.06 than 0.16.\n\nPerhaps the example had more liabilities, but here it's just current liabilities.\n\nSo, I'll go with '0.06'.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** -1,352,379.63\n- **Total Revenue:** 5,755,241.17\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,352,379.63}{5,755,241.17} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,352,379.63}{5,755,241.17} \\approx -0.2349 \\]\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n\n\\[ -0.2349 \\times 100\\% \\approx -23.49\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately -23.49%.\n\nIn the example, it was -30.29%, which was similarly calculated.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -7,724,112.71\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 737,762.05\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-7,724,112.71}{737,762.05} \\]\n\nDivide:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-7,724,112.71}{737,762.05} \\approx -10.47 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately -10.47.\n\nIn the example, it was -3.90, which was similarly a negative number.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all three ratios:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.06\n- Net Profit Margin: -23.49%\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -10.47\n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '-23.49%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-10.47'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the ratios were presented with two decimal places for the first and third ratios, and two decimal places with a percent sign for the second. So, I'll adjust to match that format:\n\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.06 (already two decimal places)\n- Net Profit Margin: -23.49% (already two decimal places with %)\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -10.47 (already two decimal places)\n\nSo, the final answer is correct as is.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Net Profit Margin': '-23.49%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-10.47'} }\n```",
