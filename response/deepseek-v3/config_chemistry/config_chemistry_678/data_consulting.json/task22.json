                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n**Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**\nThis measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\nWhere:\n- Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable\n- Current Liabilities = Short-term debts and obligations due within a year\n\n**Net Profit Margin:**\nThis shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (end of period amounts):\n- Cash on Hand: -206,636.07\n- Bank Deposits: 2,406.99\n- Interest Receivable: 1,225.71\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,604,015.21\n- Inventory: 5,550,000.00 (not part of quick assets)\n- Total Current Liabilities: 737,762.05\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Total Revenue: 5,755,241.17\n- Net Profit: -1,352,379.63\n\n### Calculating Quick Ratio\n\n**Step 1: Identify Quick Assets**\nQuick assets typically include:\n1. Cash and Cash Equivalents: \n   - Cash on Hand: -206,636.07\n   - Bank Deposits: 2,406.99\n   - Total Cash: -206,636.07 + 2,406.99 = -204,229.08\n   (Negative cash is unusual; might imply overdraft, but we'll proceed with the given number.)\n2. Marketable Securities: Not provided, so assume 0.\n3. Accounts Receivable: 1,604,015.21\n4. Interest Receivable: 1,225.71 (usually considered quick as it's expected to be received soon)\n\nTotal Quick Assets:\n= Cash + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n= (-204,229.08) + 1,604,015.21 + 1,225.71\n= (-204,229.08) + 1,605,240.92\n= 1,401,011.84\n\n**Step 2: Current Liabilities**\nGiven as: 737,762.05\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Quick Ratio**\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{1,401,011.84}{737,762.05} \\approx 1.899 \\]\nRounding to two decimal places: 1.90\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the quick ratio was 1.54, and their quick assets were Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable, excluding inventory. \n\nLet me recheck the quick assets definition. Sometimes, interest receivable might not be included unless it's expected to be received very shortly. If we exclude interest receivable:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash + Accounts Receivable\n= (-204,229.08) + 1,604,015.21\n= 1,399,786.13\n\nQuick Ratio = 1,399,786.13 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.897 ≈ 1.90\n\nHmm, still around 1.90. Maybe the negative cash is treated differently. Alternatively, perhaps bank deposits are considered separately from cash on hand, but adding them gives negative cash still.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only positive cash is considered, and negative is treated as zero. If cash is zero:\n\nQuick Assets = 0 (cash) + 1,604,015.21 (AR) + 1,225.71 (Interest Rec.)\n= 1,605,240.92\n\nQuick Ratio = 1,605,240.92 / 737,762.05 ≈ 2.18\n\nThis seems inconsistent with the example. Maybe the initial approach is correct, and the quick ratio is indeed ~1.90.\n\nGiven that the example had a similar structure, perhaps the slight difference is due to the negative cash. For consistency, let's proceed with including all possible quick assets, even with negative cash.\n\nQuick Ratio = 1.90\n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\n\nGiven:\nNet Profit = -1,352,379.63\nTotal Revenue = 5,755,241.17\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,352,379.63}{5,755,241.17} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating the division:\n-1,352,379.63 / 5,755,241.17 ≈ -0.2349\n\nMultiply by 100:\n≈ -23.49%\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the quick assets:\nIf we consider that \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" might just be Bank Deposits (since Cash on Hand is negative), then:\n\nQuick Assets = Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable\n= 2,406.99 + 1,604,015.21 + 1,225.71\n= 1,607,647.91\n\nQuick Ratio = 1,607,647.91 / 737,762.05 ≈ 2.18\n\nThis seems higher. Maybe the correct interpretation is to include all cash items even if negative, leading to ~1.90.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the example included all cash items, let's stick with the first method:\n\nQuick Assets = (-206,636.07) + 2,406.99 + 1,225.71 + 1,604,015.21\n= (-206,636.07) + 2,406.99 = -204,229.08\n+ 1,225.71 = -203,003.37\n+ 1,604,015.21 = 1,401,011.84\n\nQuick Ratio = 1,401,011.84 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90\n\nNet Profit Margin is correctly -23.49%.\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, their Net Profit Margin was -30.29%, which is Net Profit / Total Revenue, so our calculation seems correct.\n\nPerhaps the quick ratio in the example was calculated without interest receivable. If we exclude interest receivable here:\n\nQuick Assets = (-204,229.08) + 1,604,015.21 = 1,399,786.13\nQuick Ratio = 1,399,786.13 / 737,762.05 ≈ 1.90\n\nStill the same. Maybe the example had a different approach. Given that, and since our calculations seem consistent, let's proceed with:\n\nQuick Ratio: 1.90\nNet Profit Margin: -23.49%\n\nBut the example had percentages with two decimal places, so let's present similarly.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.90', 'Net Profit Margin': '-23.49%'} }\n```\n\n*Wait*, looking back at the example, their quick ratio was 1.54 with similar numbers, maybe they didn't include interest receivable and treated negative cash differently. If we exclude interest receivable and consider only bank deposits as cash (excluding negative cash on hand):\n\nQuick Assets = Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 2,406.99 + 1,604,015.21\n= 1,606,422.20\n\nQuick Ratio = 1,606,422.20 / 737,762.05 ≈ 2.18\n\nStill not matching. Maybe they didn't include bank deposits if cash on hand is negative. If quick assets are only accounts receivable:\n\nQuick Assets = 1,604,015.21\nQuick Ratio = 1,604,015.21 / 737,762.05 ≈ 2.17\n\nNot matching. Alternatively, maybe they subtracted the negative cash:\n\nOriginal total current assets: 6,951,011.84\nInventory: 5,550,000.00\nQuick Assets = Total Current Assets - Inventory\n= 6,951,011.84 - 5,550,000.00\n= 1,401,011.84\n\nThis matches our first calculation, leading to Quick Ratio = 1.90\n\nSo, likely the correct quick ratio is 1.90, and the example had a different number possibly due to different data.\n\nThus, final answer remains:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.90', 'Net Profit Margin': '-23.49%'} }\n```",
