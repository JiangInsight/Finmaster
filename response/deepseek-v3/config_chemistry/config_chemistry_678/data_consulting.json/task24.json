                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio to understand how to compute them based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Liabilities:** This is the sum of all liabilities. In the given balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" we have:\n  - Accounts Payable: 450,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 287,762.05\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 737,762.05\n\n  There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05.\n\n- **Total Assets:** From the balance sheet, \"Total Assets\" at the end date is 12,385,382.42.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{737,762.05}{12,385,382.42} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ \\frac{737,762.05}{12,385,382.42} \\approx 0.05956 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\approx 0.06 \\]\n\nWait a minute, but in the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was 0.14, which seems higher. Maybe I missed something. Let me check the liabilities again.\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, under \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity,\" it's 12,385,382.42, which matches Total Assets. The liabilities are indeed just the current liabilities of 737,762.05, and the rest is owner's equity (Paid-in Capital + Retained Earnings).\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. Maybe the example had more liabilities. For our case, it's approximately 0.06.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other liabilities not listed under current. It seems not, so we'll proceed with 0.06.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -7,724,112.71\n- **Net Income (Net Profit):** -1,352,379.63 (from the income statement)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-7,724,112.71}{-1,352,379.63} \\]\n\nDividing two negatives gives a positive:\n\\[ \\approx \\frac{7,724,112.71}{1,352,379.63} \\approx 5.71 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 5.71.\n\nBut in the example, the ratio was 4.41 when both numbers were negative. So, this seems correct.\n\nWait, let's compute it precisely:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7,724,112.71}{1,352,379.63} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n1,352,379.63 * 5 = 6,761,898.15\n7,724,112.71 - 6,761,898.15 = 962,214.56\n1,352,379.63 * 0.7 ≈ 946,665.74\nRemaining: 962,214.56 - 946,665.74 ≈ 15,548.82\nSo, roughly 5.7.\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 5.71.\n\nBut the example had a ratio of 4.41, which is also a positive number despite both cash flow and net income being negative. So, our calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '5.71'} }\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify the Debt to Asset Ratio calculation again to ensure no liabilities are missed.\n\nTotal Liabilities:\n- Accounts Payable: 450,000\n- Taxes Payable: 287,762.05\nTotal: 737,762.05\n\nTotal Assets: 12,385,382.42\n\n737,762.05 / 12,385,382.42 ≈ 0.05956 ≈ 0.06\n\nYes, correct.\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Net Income:\n-7,724,112.71 / -1,352,379.63 = 7,724,112.71 / 1,352,379.63 ≈ 5.71\n\nCorrect.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is as above.",
