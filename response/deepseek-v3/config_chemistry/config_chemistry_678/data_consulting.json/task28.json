                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. We need to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. \n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: This measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Gross Profit Margin**: This shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This indicates how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nLet's go through each financial statement to extract the numbers we need.\n\n#### Balance Sheet\n\nFrom the balance sheet at the end date (2024-01-29):\n\n- **Total Assets**: 12,385,382.42\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 737,762.05\n  - This includes:\n    - Accounts Payable: 450,000.00\n    - Taxes Payable: 287,762.05\n- **Total Liabilities**: \n  - In this case, it seems only current liabilities are present (no long-term liabilities are listed), so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05\n- **Owner's Equity**: 11,647,620.37\n\n#### Income Statement\n\nFrom the income statement for the period ending 2024-01-29:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 5,755,241.17\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 4,680,000.00\n- **Gross Profit**: 1,075,241.17\n  - (Calculated as Total Revenue - COGS = 5,755,241.17 - 4,680,000.00)\n\n#### Cash Flow Statement\n\nFrom the cash flow statement for the period ending 2024-01-29:\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -7,724,112.71\n\n### Calculating the Ratios\n\nNow, let's calculate each ratio one by one.\n\n#### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{737,762.05}{12,385,382.42}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{737,762.05}{12,385,382.42} \\approx 0.0596\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.06\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the Debt to Asset Ratio was 0.14, which suggests that perhaps Total Liabilities include more than just current liabilities. However, in our given balance sheet, only current liabilities are listed under liabilities, and there's no mention of long-term liabilities. \n\nWait, let's double-check the balance sheet structure. \n\nIn the balance sheet provided, under liabilities, we have:\n\n- Accounts Payable\n- Taxes Payable\n- Total Current Liabilities\n\nAnd then under equity:\n\n- Paid-in Capital\n- Retained Earnings\n- Total Owner's Equity\n\nThere's no separate line for long-term liabilities. So, it seems Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05.\n\nGiven that, the calculation stands at approximately 0.06. \n\nBut to match the format in the example, let's present it as '0.06'.\n\n#### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,075,241.17}{5,755,241.17} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1,075,241.17}{5,755,241.17} \\approx 0.1868\n\\]\n\\[\n0.1868 \\times 100\\% \\approx 18.68\\%\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 18.68%\n\nLooking at the example, it was '18.80%', so similar precision here.\n\n#### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{-7,724,112.71}{737,762.05}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-7,724,112.71}{737,762.05} \\approx -10.47\n\\]\n\nThis is a negative ratio, indicating that the company's operating cash flow is negative relative to its current liabilities, which is not a good sign. \n\nIn the example, it was '-3.90', so similarly negative here but more pronounced.\n\n### Verifying Calculations\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes.\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   - Total Liabilities: 737,762.05\n   - Total Assets: 12,385,382.42\n   - 737,762.05 / 12,385,382.42 ≈ 0.0596 → 0.06\n\n2. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: 1,075,241.17\n   - Total Revenue: 5,755,241.17\n   - (1,075,241.17 / 5,755,241.17) * 100 ≈ 18.68%\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,724,112.71\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 737,762.05\n   - -7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 ≈ -10.47\n\nAll calculations seem correct based on the provided data.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Gross Profit Margin': '18.68%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-10.47'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Debt to Asset Ratio**: The low ratio (0.06) suggests that the company is financed primarily by equity rather than debt, which is generally less risky.\n  \n- **Gross Profit Margin**: At ~18.68%, this indicates that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about $0.19 after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This seems reasonable but would need industry benchmarks for context.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: The negative value (-10.47) is concerning, indicating that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover current liabilities, which could signal liquidity problems.\n\nGiven that the example had similar negative cash flow and the calculations align with the provided data, the above solution should be correct.",
