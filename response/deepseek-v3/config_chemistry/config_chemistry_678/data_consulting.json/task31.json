                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all Main Business Revenue is credit sales) = 5,755,241.17\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (Initial_amount) = 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (End_amount) = 1,604,015.21\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 1,604,015.21) / 2 = 802,007.605\n\n**Calculation:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 5,755,241.17 / 802,007.605 ≈ 7.18\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7,724,112.71\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 737,762.05\n\n**Calculation:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -7,724,112.71 / 737,762.05 ≈ -10.47\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems to be the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example provided (both had the same value). So:\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = -10.47\n\nBut in the example, both were the same, so perhaps it's intended to be the same here.\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Sales (Main Business Revenue) = 5,755,241.17\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- Ending Total Assets = 12,385,382.42\n- Average Total Assets = (13,000,000 + 12,385,382.42) / 2 = 12,692,691.21\n\n**Calculation:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = 5,755,241.17 / 12,692,691.21 ≈ 0.45\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 737,762.05 (since no non-current liabilities are listed)\n- Total Shareholders' Equity = 11,647,620.37\n\n**Calculation:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = 737,762.05 / 11,647,620.37 ≈ 0.063\n\nHowever, in the example, the Debt to Equity Ratio was calculated as Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity, which seems correct here too. Maybe I missed non-current liabilities, but in this case, only current liabilities are present.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter calculating all the ratios, here's the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.18', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-10.47', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-10.47', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.45', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06'} }\n```\n\n**Wait a minute!** \n\nLooking back at the example, the Debt to Equity Ratio was higher (0.16) even though the current liabilities were higher relative to equity. In our case, current liabilities are much smaller compared to equity, leading to a lower ratio (0.06). That seems correct based on the numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is higher here because sales are higher relative to average receivables compared to the example.\n\nThe operating cash flow ratios are more negative here because the operating cash outflow is larger relative to current liabilities.\n\nTotal Asset Turnover is slightly higher here (0.45 vs. 0.41 in the example), which makes sense given the sales and asset figures.\n\nEverything checks out based on the calculations. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.18', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-10.47', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-10.47', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.45', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06'} }\n```",
