These represent the amounts that have been recorded as accounts payable but have not yet been paid out in cash.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Purchases with Account Payable:**\n   - Look for transactions where:\n     - `type` is \"Purchase\"\n     - `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\"\n     - `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\"\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Transactions:**\n   - From the given data, the following transactions meet the criteria:\n     - `Purchase20231231002`: Amount = 800,000.00\n     - `Purchase20231231004`: Amount = 750,000.00\n     - `Purchase20231231010`: Amount = 1,250,000.00\n     - `Purchase20231231012`: Amount = 210,000.00\n\n3. **Sum the Amounts:**\n   - Total Accounts Payable = 800,000.00 + 750,000.00 + 1,250,000.00 + 210,000.00 = 3,010,000.00\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is the total unpaid amount, which is 3,010,000.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '3010000.00'} }\n```",
