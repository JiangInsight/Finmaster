Depreciation is typically recorded as an expense in the income statement and appears as a line item in the transactions data.\n\nLooking at the provided data, we can see that there is a transaction with the type \"Depreciation\" and the date \"2024-01-01\". The amount recorded for this transaction is \"45751.04\".\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Scan the transactions data for entries where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\".\n2. Identify the \"amount\" or \"recorded_amount\" associated with the depreciation entry.\n3. The depreciation amount is the value that will appear in the income statement under the depreciation expense line item.\n\nFrom the data:\n- The depreciation entry is: \"Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45751.04 | 45751.04 | ...\"\n- The amount is \"45751.04\".\n\nTherefore, the final depreciation item in the income statement is \"45751.04\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45751.04'} }\n```",
