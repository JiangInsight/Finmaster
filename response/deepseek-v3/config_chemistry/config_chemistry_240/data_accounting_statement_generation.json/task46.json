Fixed assets are not considered as part of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFrom the given data:\n1. Initial cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n2. Initial bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n\nAdding these two amounts gives the beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents:\n3,000,000.0 (cash) + 5,000,000.0 (bank) = 8,000,000.0\n\nThe fixed assets of 5,000,000.0 are not included in the cash and cash equivalents balance.\n\nHere is the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
