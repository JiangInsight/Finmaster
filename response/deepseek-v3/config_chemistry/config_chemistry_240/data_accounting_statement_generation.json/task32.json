Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Revenue Items**: These are primarily the \"Sale\" transactions where the company earns income from selling products.\n2. **Identify Expense Items**: These include \"Purchase\", \"Expense\", \"Depreciation\", and other cost-related transactions.\n3. **Calculate Total Revenue**: Sum up all the profit amounts from \"Sale\" transactions.\n4. **Calculate Total Expenses**: Sum up all the amounts from \"Expense\", \"Depreciation\", and other cost-related transactions.\n5. **Calculate Profit Before Tax**: Subtract total expenses from total revenue.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n#### 1. Total Revenue from Sales:\nFrom the \"Sale\" transactions, we sum the \"profit\" column (which is the profit from each sale after accounting for cost_amount and tax_amount). \n\nLooking at the transactions:\n- Sale20240102003: profit = 24961.24\n- Sale20240103005: profit = 7957.22\n- Sale20240103006: profit = 23043.30\n- Sale20240104007: profit = 74628.85\n- Sale20240104008: profit = 5730.78\n- Sale20240105009: profit = 3427.66\n- Sale20240106011: profit = 70861.76\n- Sale20240106012: profit = 65860.56\n- Sale20240107015: profit = 8931.68\n- Sale20240107016: profit = 58853.52\n- Sale20240108017: profit = 4600.64\n- Sale20240108018: profit = 126615.25\n- Sale20240109019: profit = 57532.02\n- Sale20240109020: profit = 15581.34\n- Sale20240110021: profit = 13512.74\n- Sale20240111024: profit = 26744.92\n- Sale20240111025: profit = 161322.55\n- Sale20240112027: profit = 1505.06\n- Sale20240112028: profit = 12422.12\n- Sale20240113029: profit = 4492.22\n- Sale20240114031: profit = 24561.21\n- Sale20240115032: profit = 78375.60\n- Sale20240115033: profit = 12896.84\n- Sale20240116034: profit = 7166.55\n- Sale20240116035: profit = 13297.76\n- Sale20240117036: profit = 13542.40\n- Sale20240118038: profit = 13436.74\n- Sale20240118039: profit = 24386.60\n- Sale20240119042: profit = 12837.34\n- Sale20240119043: profit = 94053.68\n- Sale20240120044: profit = 72732.32\n- Sale20240121045: profit = 11510.49\n- Sale20240121046: profit = 6672.84\n- Sale20240122047: profit = 79472.40\n- Sale20240123048: profit = 76826.90\n- Sale20240123049: profit = 9988.65\n- Sale20240124050: profit = 34776.84\n- Sale20240125051: profit = 19864.95\n- Sale20240125052: profit = 3176.48\n- Sale20240126053: profit = 45282.75\n- Sale20240127055: profit = 46311.50\n- Sale20240128057: profit = 172051.50\n\nSum of all profits from sales: **1,819,028.21**\n\n#### 2.
