I'm going to break it down to understand how much inventory we started with and how much we have at the end based on the transactions provided.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a list of transactions that include purchases and sales of inventory items. Our goal is to calculate:\n\n1. **Inventory Initial Value**: The total value of inventory at the beginning (which seems to be zero based on the example).\n2. **Inventory End Value**: The total value of inventory at the end after accounting for all purchases and sales.\n\n### Identifying Relevant Transactions\n\nFirst, we need to identify which transactions affect the inventory:\n\n- **Purchase Transactions**: These increase our inventory. They are marked with the type \"Purchase\" and include details like product_id, quantity, and cost_per_unit.\n- **Sale Transactions**: These decrease our inventory. They are marked with the type \"Sale\" and include product_id, quantity sold, and cost_per_unit (which tells us the cost of the items sold).\n\n### Initial Inventory\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems the initial inventory value is zero unless there are initial inventory entries. In the given problem, there are no initial inventory entries, so we'll assume:\n\n**Inventory Initial Value = 0.00**\n\n### Calculating Inventory Changes\n\nNow, let's go through all the purchase and sale transactions to calculate the ending inventory.\n\n#### Step 1: Sum Up All Purchases\n\nWe'll look for all \"Purchase\" transactions and sum up the quantities for each product.\n\nFrom the data, the purchase transactions are:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: \n   - product_id: P001 (Chemical Product A)\n   - quantity: 19\n   - cost_per_unit: 10000.0\n   - total cost: 19 * 10000 = 190,000\n\n2. Purchase20231231002:\n   - product_id: P003 (Chemical Product C)\n   - quantity: 16\n   - cost_per_unit: 50000.0\n   - total cost: 16 * 50000 = 800,000 (but amount is 800,000, matches)\n\n3. Purchase20231231003:\n   - product_id: P003\n   - quantity: 9\n   - cost_per_unit: 50000.0\n   - total cost: 9 * 50000 = 450,000\n\n4. Purchase20231231004:\n   - product_id: P003\n   - quantity: 15\n   - cost_per_unit: 50000.0\n   - total cost: 15 * 50000 = 750,000\n\n5. Purchase20231231005:\n   - product_id: P004 (Chemical Product D)\n   - quantity: 16\n   - cost_per_unit: 100000.0\n   - total cost: 16 * 100000 = 1,600,000\n\n6. Purchase20231231006:\n   - product_id: P001\n   - quantity: 10\n   - cost_per_unit: 10000.0\n   - total cost: 10 * 10000 = 100,000\n\n7. Purchase20231231007:\n   - product_id: P002 (Chemical Product B)\n   - quantity: 17\n   - cost_per_unit: 20000.0\n   - total cost: 17 * 20000 = 340,000\n\n8. Purchase20231231008:\n   - product_id: P002\n   - quantity: 15\n   - cost_per_unit: 20000.0\n   - total cost: 15 * 20000 = 300,000\n\n9. Purchase20231231009:\n   - product_id: P004\n   - quantity: 27\n   - cost_per_unit: 100000.0\n   - total cost: 27 * 100000 = 2,700,000\n\n10. Purchase20231231010:\n    - product_id: P003\n    - quantity: 25\n    - cost_per_unit: 50000.0\n    - total cost: 25 * 50000 = 1,250,000\n\n11. Purchase20231231011:\n    - product_id: P001\n    - quantity: 6\n    - cost_per_unit: 10000.0\n    - total cost: 6 * 10000 = 60,000\n\n12. Purchase20231231012:\n    - product_id: P001\n    - quantity: 21\n    - cost_per_unit: 10000.0\n    - total cost: 21 * 10000 = 210,000\n\n13. Purchase20231231013:\n    - product_id: P004\n    - quantity: 8\n    - cost_per_unit: 100000.0\n    - total cost: 8 * 100000 = 800,000\n\n14. Purchase20231231014:\n    - product_id: P002\n    - quantity: 20\n    - cost_per_unit: 20000.0\n    - total cost: 20 * 20000 = 400,000\n\n15. Purchase20231231015:\n    - product_id: P003\n    - quantity: 26\n    - cost_per_unit: 50000.0\n    - total cost: 26 * 50000 = 1,300,000\n\nNow, let's sum up the quantities for each product from purchases:\n\n- P001: 19 + 10 + 6 + 21 = 56\n- P002: 17 + 15 + 20 = 52\n- P003: 16 + 9 + 15 + 25 + 26 = 91\n- P004: 16 + 27 + 8 = 51\n\n#### Step 2: Sum Up All Sales\n\nNow, let's look at the sales to see how much inventory was sold.\n\nFrom the data, the sale transactions are:\n\n1. Sale20240102003:\n   - product_id: P003\n   - quantity: 4\n   - cost_per_unit: 50000.0\n   - cost_amount: 200,000 (4 * 50000)\n\n2.
