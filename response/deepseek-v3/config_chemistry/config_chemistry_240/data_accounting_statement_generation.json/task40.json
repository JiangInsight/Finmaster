Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Purchase Transactions\nWe look for all transactions where the type is \"Purchase\". These represent inventory additions. From the data, the purchase transactions are:\n\n1. Purchase20231231001: 19 units of P001 at 10,000 per unit → 19 * 10,000 = 190,000\n2. Purchase20231231002: 16 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit → 16 * 50,000 = 800,000 (Unpaid, but still part of inventory)\n3. Purchase20231231003: 9 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit → 9 * 50,000 = 450,000\n4. Purchase20231231004: 15 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit → 15 * 50,000 = 750,000 (Unpaid, but still part of inventory)\n5. Purchase20231231005: 16 units of P004 at 100,000 per unit → 16 * 100,000 = 1,600,000\n6. Purchase20231231006: 10 units of P001 at 10,000 per unit → 10 * 10,000 = 100,000\n7. Purchase20231231007: 17 units of P002 at 20,000 per unit → 17 * 20,000 = 340,000\n8. Purchase20231231008: 15 units of P002 at 20,000 per unit → 15 * 20,000 = 300,000\n9. Purchase20231231009: 27 units of P004 at 100,000 per unit → 27 * 100,000 = 2,700,000\n10. Purchase20231231010: 25 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit → 25 * 50,000 = 1,250,000 (Unpaid, but still part of inventory)\n11. Purchase20231231011: 6 units of P001 at 10,000 per unit → 6 * 10,000 = 60,000\n12. Purchase20231231012: 21 units of P001 at 10,000 per unit → 21 * 10,000 = 210,000 (Unpaid, but still part of inventory)\n13. Purchase20231231013: 8 units of P004 at 100,000 per unit → 8 * 100,000 = 800,000\n14. Purchase20231231014: 20 units of P002 at 20,000 per unit → 20 * 20,000 = 400,000\n15. Purchase20231231015: 26 units of P003 at 50,000 per unit → 26 * 50,000 = 1,300,000\n\nTotal Purchases = 190,000 + 800,000 + 450,000 + 750,000 + 1,600,000 + 100,000 + 340,000 + 300,000 + 2,700,000 + 1,250,000 + 60,000 + 210,000 + 800,000 + 400,000 + 1,300,000 = 11,850,000\n\n### Step 2: Identify Sale Transactions\nWe look for all transactions where the type is \"Sale\". These represent inventory reductions (cost of goods sold). From the data, the sale transactions are:\n\n1. Sale20240102003: 4 units of P003 at 50,000 cost per unit → 4 * 50,000 = 200,000\n2. Sale20240103005: 1 unit of P003 at 50,000 cost per unit → 1 * 50,000 = 50,000\n3. Sale20240103006: 2 units of P003 at 50,000 cost per unit → 2 * 50,000 = 100,000\n4.

Sale20240105009: 1 unit of P001 at 10,000 cost per unit → 1 * 10,000 = 10,000\n7. Sale20240106011: 2 units of P004 at 100,000 cost per unit → 2 * 100,000 = 200,000\n8. Sale20240106012: 4 units of P004 at 100,000 cost per unit → 4 * 100,000 = 400,000\n9. Sale20240107015: 4 units of P002 at 20,000 cost per unit → 4 * 20,000 = 80,000\n10. Sale20240107016: 3 units of P003 at 50,000 cost per unit → 3 * 50,000 = 150,000\n11. Sale20240108017: 4 units of P001 at 10,000 cost per unit → 4 * 10,000 = 40,000\n12.

Sale20240121045: 1 unit of P004 at 100,000 cost per unit → 1 * 100,000 = 100,000\n33. Sale20240121046: 3 units of P002 at 20,000 cost per unit → 3 * 20,000 = 60,000\n34. Sale20240122047: 3 units of P004 at 100,000 cost per unit → 3 * 100,000 = 300,000\n35. Sale20240123048: 5 units of P004 at 100,000 cost per unit → 5 * 100,000 = 500,000\n36. Sale20240123049: 1 unit of P003 at 50,000 cost per unit → 1 * 50,000 = 50,000\n37. Sale20240124050: 4 units of P003 at 50,000 cost per unit → 4 * 50,000 = 200,000\n38. Sale20240125051: 5 units of P001 at 10,000 cost per unit → 5 * 10,000 = 50,000\n39. Sale20240125052: 2 units of P001 at 10,000 cost per unit → 2 * 10,000 = 20,000\n40.

Sale20240128057: 5 units of P004 at 100,000 cost per unit → 5 * 100,000 = 500,000\n\nTotal Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = Sum of all above = 6,750,000\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Inventory Change\nThe change in inventory is calculated as:\n(Increase) Decrease in Inventory = Total Purchases - COGS\n= 11,850,000 - 6,750,000 = 5,100,000\n\nSince inventory increased, we report it as a negative value in the cash flow statement (cash outflow).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-5100000.00'}}\n```",
