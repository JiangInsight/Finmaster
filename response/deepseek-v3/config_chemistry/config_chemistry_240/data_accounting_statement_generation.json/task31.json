Interest20240101001: 428.09\n2. Interest20240102002: 428.09\n3. Interest20240103003: 388.04\n4. Interest20240104004: 388.04\n5. Interest20240105005: 348.88\n6. Interest20240106006: 348.88\n7. Interest20240107007: 348.88\n8. Interest20240108008: 348.88\n9. Interest20240109009: 348.88\n10. Interest20240110010: 348.88\n11. Interest20240111011: 108.58\n12. Interest20240112012: 108.58\n13. Interest20240113013: 62.57\n14. Interest20240114014: 62.57\n15. Interest20240115015: 62.57\n16. Interest20240116016: 62.57\n17. Interest20240117017: 62.57\n18. Interest20240118018: 62.57\n19. Interest20240119019: 62.57\n20. Interest20240120020: 62.57\n21. Interest20240121021: 62.57\n22. Interest20240122022: 18.86\n23. Interest20240123023: -7.84\n24. Interest20240124024: -16.74\n25. Interest20240125025: 9.96\n26. Interest20240126026: 2.38\n27. Interest20240127027: 11.28\n28. Interest20240128028: 11.28\n\nNow, let's sum all these amounts:\n\n428.09 + 428.09 + 388.04 + 388.04 + 348.88 + 348.88 + 348.88 + 348.88 + 348.88 + 348.88 + 108.58 + 108.58 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 18.86 + (-7.84) + (-16.74) + 9.96 + 2.38 + 11.28 + 11.28 = 3,999.99\n\nHowever, this seems too high compared to the example provided (which was 2672.87). Let me recalculate more carefully:\n\nAdding them sequentially:\n428.09 + 428.09 = 856.18\n856.18 + 388.04 = 1,244.22\n1,244.22 + 388.04 = 1,632.26\n1,632.26 + 348.88 = 1,981.14\n1,981.14 + 348.88 = 2,330.02\n2,330.02 + 348.88 = 2,678.90\n2,678.90 + 348.88 = 3,027.78\n3,027.78 + 348.88 = 3,376.66\n3,376.66 + 348.88 = 3,725.54\n3,725.54 + 108.58 = 3,834.12\n3,834.12 + 108.58 = 3,942.70\n3,942.70 + 62.57 = 4,005.27\n4,005.27 + 62.57 = 4,067.84\n4,067.84 + 62.57 = 4,130.41\n4,130.41 + 62.57 = 4,192.98\n4,192.98 + 62.57 = 4,255.55\n4,255.55 + 62.57 = 4,318.12\n4,318.12 + 62.57 = 4,380.69\n4,380.69 + 62.57 = 4,443.26\n4,443.26 + 18.86 = 4,462.12\n4,462.12 - 7.84 = 4,454.28\n4,454.28 - 16.74 = 4,437.54\n4,437.54 + 9.96 = 4,447.50\n4,447.50 + 2.38 = 4,449.88\n4,449.88 + 11.28 = 4,461.16\n4,461.16 + 11.28 = 4,472.44\n\nThis still doesn't match the example. Perhaps we should only include positive interest amounts, or maybe there's a different calculation method. \n\nLooking back at the example, it seems they might have only included certain interest transactions. Let me try summing just the positive amounts:\n\n428.09 + 428.09 + 388.04 + 388.04 + 348.88 + 348.88 + 348.88 + 348.88 + 348.88 + 348.88 + 108.58 + 108.58 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 62.57 + 18.86 + 9.96 + 2.38 + 11.28 + 11.28 = 4,497.92\n\nThis still doesn't match. Maybe we should only include the first 28 days (like the example showed 30 days but only calculated for some period). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should consider that some interest transactions might be negative (like Interest20240123023 and Interest20240124024), representing interest expenses rather than income. \n\nIf we consider that interest income is only the positive amounts, and interest expense is the negative amounts, then:\n\nTotal positive interest: 4,497.92\nTotal negative interest: -7.84 + -16.74 = -24.58\nNet interest income: 4,497.92 - 24.58 = 4,473.34\n\nThis still doesn't match the example. Given that the example had a much smaller number (2672.87), perhaps we should only consider the first few transactions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the calculation should be based on a daily accrual method or some other accounting principle. Without more specific instructions, I'll proceed with the sum of all interest receivables transactions, which is 4,472.44.\n\nHowever, since this seems inconsistent with the example, I'll instead follow the pattern shown in the example where they summed up all interest receivables regardless of sign, which gave 2672.87 in their case. Applying the same method here:\n\nSum of all interest receivables amounts listed: 4,472.44\n\nBut since this is much higher than the example, and without knowing the exact calculation method used in the example, I'll present the sum of all interest receivables transactions:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Interest Income': '4472.44'} }\n```",
