This is because the cash flow statement reflects actual cash transactions, and only taxes from paid sales would affect the cash flow.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Identify all sales transactions with payment/receipt_status = \"Paid\"\n2. Sum their tax_amount values\n\nFrom the given data, the relevant sales transactions are:\n\n- Sale20240104007: tax_amount = 16231.44\n- Sale20240105009: tax_amount = 671.38\n- Sale20240106011: tax_amount = 13543.09\n- Sale20240106012: tax_amount = 23293.03\n- Sale20240107015: tax_amount = 4446.58\n- Sale20240107016: tax_amount = 10442.68\n- Sale20240108018: tax_amount = 31330.76\n- Sale20240109019: tax_amount = 10376.6\n- Sale20240110021: tax_amount = 2675.64\n- Sale20240111024: tax_amount = 11337.25\n- Sale20240112027: tax_amount = 575.25\n- Sale20240112028: tax_amount = 5621.11\n- Sale20240113029: tax_amount = 2224.61\n- Sale20240119042: tax_amount = 5641.87\n- Sale20240119043: tax_amount = 24702.68\n- Sale20240122047: tax_amount = 18973.62\n- Sale20240123048: tax_amount = 28841.35\n- Sale20240123049: tax_amount = 2999.43\n- Sale20240124050: tax_amount = 11738.84\n- Sale20240125052: tax_amount = 1158.82\n- Sale20240126053: tax_amount = 9764.14\n- Sale20240127055: tax_amount = 14815.58\n- Sale20240128057: tax_amount = 33602.58\n\nNow let's sum these amounts:\n\n16231.44 +\n671.38 +\n13543.09 +\n23293.03 +\n4446.58 +\n10442.68 +\n31330.76 +\n10376.60 +\n2675.64 +\n11337.25 +\n575.25 +\n5621.11 +\n2224.61 +\n5641.87 +\n24702.68 +\n18973.62 +\n28841.35 +\n2999.43 +\n11738.84 +\n1158.82 +\n9764.14 +\n14815.58 +\n33602.58 = 271550.92\n\nTherefore, the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is 271550.92.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '271550.92'} }\n```",
