                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Gross Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"Gross Profit Margin\" means. From what I recall, the Gross Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n\nThe formula for Gross Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Gross Profit** = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n- **Total Revenue** is the total income from sales before any expenses are deducted.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n1. **Total Revenue**: 8,361,807.77\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 6,720,000.00\n3. **Gross Profit**: 1,641,807.77\n\nWait a minute, the Gross Profit is already given as 1,641,807.77. That's good because it saves me a step in calculating it (which would be Total Revenue - COGS = 8,361,807.77 - 6,720,000.00 = 1,641,807.77). \n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nNow, plug the numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,641,807.77}{8,361,807.77} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,641,807.77}{8,361,807.77} \\approx 0.1963 \\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.1963 \\times 100 \\approx 19.63\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nJust to be sure, let's verify:\n\n- 8,361,807.77 * 19.63% ≈ 8,361,807.77 * 0.1963 ≈ 1,641,807.77 (which matches the Gross Profit given)\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct.\n\n### Checking the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Gross Profit: 1,021,018.59\n- Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Gross Profit Margin: (1,021,018.59 / 5,431,018.59) * 100 ≈ 18.80%\n\nThis matches the given solution, so my method aligns with the example.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 19.63%.\n\nHere's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '19.63%'}}\n```",
