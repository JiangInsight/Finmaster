From the problem, it is given as -4,900,875.61.\n\n2. **Identify Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This includes cash used for investments like purchasing fixed assets. From the problem, it is given as -1,593,203.67.\n\n3. **Calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: FCF is the sum of Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities and Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities. \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} + \\text{Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{FCF} = -4,900,875.61 + (-1,593,203.67) = -6,494,079.28\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify with Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The problem also provides the net increase in cash and cash equivalents as -6,494,079.28, which matches our FCF calculation. This serves as a cross-check.\n\nThus, the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is -6,494,079.28.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-6494079.28'} }\n```",
