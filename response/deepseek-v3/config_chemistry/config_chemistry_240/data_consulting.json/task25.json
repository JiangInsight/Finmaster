                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed):** 3,428,090.41\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 11,657,959.24\n\n(Note: In the given example, only current liabilities are present, and no long-term liabilities are listed. So, total liabilities = total current liabilities.)\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,428,090.41}{11,657,959.24} \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\\[ \\frac{3,428,090.41}{11,657,959.24} \\approx 0.294 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.29.\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** -1,342,040.76\n- **Total Revenue:** 8,361,807.77\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,342,040.76}{8,361,807.77} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\\[ \\frac{-1,342,040.76}{8,361,807.77} \\approx -0.1605 \\]\n\\[ -0.1605 \\times 100\\% \\approx -16.05\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately -16.05%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -4,900,875.61\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 3,428,090.41 (from balance sheet)\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{3,428,090.41} \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\\[ \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{3,428,090.41} \\approx -1.43 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is approximately -1.43.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.29', 'Net Profit Margin': '-16.05%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.43'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 3,428,090.41\n   - Equity: 11,657,959.24\n   - 3,428,090.41 / 11,657,959.24 ≈ 0.294 → 0.29 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: -1,342,040.76\n   - Revenue: 8,361,807.77\n   - (-1,342,040.76 / 8,361,807.77) * 100 ≈ -16.05%\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -4,900,875.61\n   - Current Liabilities: 3,428,090.41\n   - -4,900,875.61 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ -1.43\n\nAll calculations seem correct upon verification. The ratios are presented in the same format as the example provided, with the Debt to Equity Ratio and Operating Cash Flow ratio as decimals and the Net Profit Margin as a percentage.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Debt to Equity Ratio:** Typically, a ratio below 1 indicates that a company has more equity than debt, which is generally seen as less risky. Here, 0.29 suggests the company is not highly leveraged.\n  \n- **Net Profit Margin:** A negative margin indicates that the company is operating at a loss, which is concerning. Here, -16.05% means the company is losing about 16 cents for every dollar of revenue.\n\n- **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities:** A negative ratio is alarming as it suggests the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its short-term obligations. Here, -1.43 implies that operating cash outflow is 1.43 times the current liabilities, indicating significant cash burn.\n\nThese ratios collectively suggest that the company is in a financially challenging position, with losses and negative operating cash flow relative to its liabilities.",
