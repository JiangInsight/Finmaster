                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. I'll go through each one, explaining how to find them using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 3,428,090.41\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 15,086,049.65\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,428,090.41}{15,086,049.65} \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{3,428,090.41}{15,086,049.65} \\approx 0.227 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.23 (or 23% if expressed as a percentage, but typically this ratio is presented as a decimal).\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 1,641,807.77\n- **Total Revenue:** 8,361,807.77\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,641,807.77}{8,361,807.77} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nLet's calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{1,641,807.77}{8,361,807.77} \\approx 0.1964 \\]\n\\[ 0.1964 \\times 100\\% \\approx 19.64\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 19.64%.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -4,900,875.61 (negative value)\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 3,428,090.41 (from balance sheet)\n\nCalculation:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{3,428,090.41} \\]\n\nLet's compute:\n\\[ \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{3,428,090.41} \\approx -1.429 \\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately -1.43.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.23\n- Gross Profit Margin: 19.64%\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -1.43\n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.23', 'Gross Profit Margin': '19.64%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.43'} }\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example provided, the ratios were given with two decimal places for Debt to Asset Ratio and Operating Cash Flow Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin was rounded to two decimal places as well. So, to match the format:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.23 (already two decimal places)\n- Gross Profit Margin: 19.64% (matches)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -1.43 (matches)\n\nThus, the final answer is correct as is.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.23', 'Gross Profit Margin': '19.64%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.43'} }\n```",
