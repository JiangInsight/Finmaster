                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst, I need to understand what Net Profit Margin is. From what I recall, the Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. It's calculated by dividing the Net Profit by the Total Revenue and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nThe formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\nFrom the provided income statement, I can see:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 8,361,807.77\n- **Net Profit**: -1,342,040.76\n\n(Note: The amounts are in the same currency, so we don't need to worry about unit conversions.)\n\n### Calculating the Net Profit Margin\nNow, let's plug these numbers into the formula.\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,342,040.76}{8,361,807.77} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide the Net Profit by the Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,342,040.76}{8,361,807.77} \\approx -0.1605 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ -0.1605 \\times 100 = -16.05\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nLet me double-check the division to ensure accuracy.\n\nCalculating \\( \\frac{1,342,040.76}{8,361,807.77} \\):\n\n- 8,361,807.77 goes into 1,342,040.76 about 0.1605 times (since 8,361,807.77 * 0.1605 â‰ˆ 1,342,040.76).\n\nSince the Net Profit is negative, the margin is negative, which makes sense because the company is at a loss.\n\n### Final Answer\nSo, the Net Profit Margin is approximately -16.05%.\n\nExpressing this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '-16.05%'}}\n```\n\n### Comparing with the Example\nLooking back at the provided example, the calculation was:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,645,141.43}{5,431,018.59} \\times 100 \\approx -30.29\\% \\]\n\nThis matches the given solution, confirming that our method is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully performing the calculations, the Net Profit Margin for the given income statement is -16.05%. This negative value indicates that the company is operating at a loss, meaning its expenses exceed its revenues for the period.",
