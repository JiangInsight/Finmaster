                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how to calculate it based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,900,875.61\nFrom the balance sheet (end date):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{3,428,090.41} \\approx -1.43 \\]\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFirst, let's find Total Liabilities. From the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n- There's no mention of long-term liabilities, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{3,428,090.41} \\approx -1.43 \\]\n\n*Note: This seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio because in this case, all liabilities are current. In other cases, total liabilities might include long-term debt.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 6,720,000.00\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- Ending Inventory = 4,530,000.00\n\nAverage Inventory = (Initial Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2 = (0 + 4,530,000) / 2 = 2,265,000.00\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{6,720,000.00}{2,265,000.00} \\approx 2.97 \\]\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,657,959.24\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,428,090.41}{11,657,959.24} \\approx 0.29 \\]\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 8,538,597.02\n- Inventory = 4,530,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{8,538,597.02 - 4,530,000.00}{3,428,090.41} = \\frac{4,008,597.02}{3,428,090.41} \\approx 1.17 \\]\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current Assets = 8,538,597.02\n- Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{8,538,597.02}{3,428,090.41} \\approx 2.49 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.43', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.43', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '2.97', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.29', 'Quick Ratio': '1.17', 'Current Ratio': '2.49'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\nLet me quickly verify one of the calculations to ensure accuracy. For the Current Ratio:\n\nCurrent Assets = 8,538,597.02  \nCurrent Liabilities = 3,428,090.41  \n8,538,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ 2.49 ✔\n\nSimilarly, for Quick Ratio:\n\n(8,538,597.02 - 4,530,000) = 4,008,597.02  \n4,008,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ 1.17 ✔\n\nOthers seem correct based on the formulas and given data.\n\n*Note: The Operating Cash Flow Ratio and Cash Flow to Debt Ratio are the same here because total liabilities equal current liabilities in this scenario.*",
