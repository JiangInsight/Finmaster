                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the given cash flow statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\" is. From what I know, this ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income of the company. It's a measure of how well a company can turn its profits into cash.\n\nThe formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit (Net Income)}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Required Numbers\n\nFrom the given data, I need two key pieces of information:\n1. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: This is the total cash generated from the company's regular business operations.\n2. **Net Profit (Net Income)**: This is the company's total earnings or profit after all expenses and taxes.\n\nLooking at the provided table:\n\n1. **Net Profit**: It's given as -1,342,040.76 (negative value).\n2. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: It's given as -4,900,875.61 (also negative).\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{-1,342,040.76} \\]\n\nDividing these two negative numbers will give a positive result because a negative divided by a negative is positive.\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{-1,342,040.76} = \\frac{4,900,875.61}{1,342,040.76} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,900,875.61}{1,342,040.76} \\approx 3.65 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 3.65.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let's verify:\n\n- If Net Income is -1,342,040.76 and the ratio is 3.65, then Operating Cash Flow should be:\n  \\[ -1,342,040.76 \\times 3.65 \\approx -4,900,875.61 \\]\n  \nWhich matches the given Operating Cash Flow. So, the calculation seems correct.\n\n### Considering the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example:\n\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\n- Ratio calculated: 4.41\n\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\frac{-7,259,994.10}{-1,645,141.43} \\approx 4.41 \\]\n\nThis matches the given solution, confirming that the approach is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nFor the given problem:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,900,875.61\n- Net Profit: -1,342,040.76\n- Ratio: 3.65\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.65'} }\n```",
