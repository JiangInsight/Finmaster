                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Since we only have the ending inventory (no beginning inventory other than zero), we'll assume the average inventory is the ending inventory. This might not be perfectly accurate but is a common approach when beginning inventory isn't provided or is zero.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** (end of period):\n\n- **Total Current Assets**: 8,538,597.02\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 3,428,090.41\n- **Inventory (Ending)**: 4,530,000.00\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 6,720,000.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{8,538,597.02}{3,428,090.41}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8,538,597.02}{3,428,090.41} \\approx 2.49\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **2.49**.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nAssuming average inventory is the ending inventory (since beginning is zero):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{6,720,000.00}{4,530,000.00}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6,720,000.00}{4,530,000.00} \\approx 1.48\n\\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **1.48**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n- **Current Assets**: 8,538,597.02\n- **Current Liabilities**: 3,428,090.41\n  - 8,538,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ 2.49 (correct)\n  \n- **COGS**: 6,720,000\n- **Inventory**: 4,530,000\n  - 6,720,000 / 4,530,000 ≈ 1.48 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.49', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '1.48'} }\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: Normally, we'd prefer to have the average of beginning and ending inventory. Here, beginning inventory is zero, which might imply the company didn't have inventory at the start, and all inventory was purchased during the period. Using ending inventory as the average is a practical approach in this context.\n  \n- **Current Ratio**: A ratio above 1 indicates that current assets exceed current liabilities, which is good for liquidity. Here, 2.49 suggests a strong liquidity position.\n\nThese ratios provide insights into the company's short-term financial health and how efficiently it's managing its inventory.",
