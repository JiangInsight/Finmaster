                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial task step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio.\n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:**\nGross Profit Margin is a measure of a company's profitability and is calculated by dividing gross profit by total revenue (or total sales). It shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS).\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Gross Profit = 1,641,807.77\n- Total Revenue = 8,361,807.77\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,641,807.77}{8,361,807.77} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{1,641,807.77}{8,361,807.77} \\approx 0.1964 \\]\n\\[ 0.1964 \\times 100 \\approx 19.64\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **19.64%**.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Cash Flow to Debt Ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated by dividing operating cash flow by total debt.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\n**Identifying Components:**\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,900,875.61 (This is negative, indicating cash outflow)\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\nTotal Debt isn't explicitly listed, but we can infer it from the liabilities. The balance sheet shows:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so total debt is essentially the total current liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{3,428,090.41} \\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\\[ \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{3,428,090.41} \\approx -1.43 \\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-1.43**.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nA negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, meaning it's not generating enough cash from operations to cover its debt obligations, which is a concerning sign.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '19.64%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.43'}}\n```\n\n### Verification:\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin:**\n   - Gross Profit: 1,641,807.77\n   - Total Revenue: 8,361,807.77\n   - 1,641,807.77 / 8,361,807.77 ≈ 0.1964 → 19.64% ✔\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -4,900,875.61\n   - Total Debt (Current Liabilities): 3,428,090.41\n   - -4,900,875.61 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ -1.43 ✔\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin:** A 19.64% margin means that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about $0.1964 after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This is a decent margin, indicating that the company has a reasonable markup on its products or services.\n  \n- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:** A negative value here is problematic. It suggests that the company is not generating positive cash flow from its operations to service its debt. This could be due to high operating expenses, poor receivables management, or other cash flow issues. Investors and creditors would view this negatively as it indicates potential liquidity problems.\n\nGiven that the company has negative net profit and negative operating cash flow, despite a decent gross profit margin, it seems that the administrative, selling, and financial expenses are eating into the gross profit significantly, leading to overall losses. The high accounts receivable and inventory increases are also tying up cash, contributing to the negative operating cash flow. The purchase of fixed assets further drains cash, as seen in the investing activities. \n\nIn summary, while the company can generate a healthy gross profit from its sales, its operational efficiency and cash management need improvement to ensure sustainability.",
