                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios one by one: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, Return on Assets (ROA), and Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by comparing its total liabilities to its shareholders' equity.\n\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n- There are no non-current liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,657,959.24\n\n**Calculation:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = 3,428,090.41 / 11,657,959.24 ≈ 0.294\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue.\n\n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -1,342,040.76\n- Total Revenue = 8,361,807.77\n\n**Calculation:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (-1,342,040.76 / 8,361,807.77) * 100 ≈ -16.05%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate profit.\n\n**Formula:**  \nROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 15,086,049.65\n- Net Profit = -1,342,040.76 (from income statement)\n\n**Calculation:**  \nROA = (-1,342,040.76 / 15,086,049.65) * 100 ≈ -8.90%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company collects receivables from customers.\n\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no cash sales are mentioned), Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 8,361,807.77\n\nFor Average Accounts Receivable:\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (from initial balance sheet) = 0.00\n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 2,498,141.24\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning + Ending) / 2 = (0 + 2,498,141.24) / 2 = 1,249,070.62\n\n**Calculation:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 8,361,807.77 / 1,249,070.62 ≈ 6.69\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all the calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.29', 'Net Profit Margin': '-16.05%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-8.90%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '6.69'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes:\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:** 3,428,090.41 / 11,657,959.24 ≈ 0.294 → rounded to 0.29\n2. **Net Profit Margin:** -1,342,040.76 / 8,361,807.77 ≈ -0.1605 → -16.05%\n3. **ROA:** -1,342,040.76 / 15,086,049.65 ≈ -0.089 → -8.90%\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover:** 8,361,807.77 / 1,249,070.62 ≈ 6.694 → 6.69\n\nAll calculations seem correct based on the provided data. The ratios are presented in the required format with appropriate rounding.\n\n**Note on Accounts Receivable Turnover:**\n\nIn the example provided, the Accounts Receivable Turnover was calculated as 4.47 with similar data. Here, our calculation is higher (6.69), which could be due to higher revenue relative to accounts receivable in this problem compared to the example. This indicates that, in this case, the company is collecting its receivables more frequently within the period, which is generally better. \n\nHowever, since the initial accounts receivable was 0, the average is half of the ending amount, which might not perfectly represent the turnover if sales were made throughout the period. But with the given data, this is the standard way to calculate it.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.29', 'Net Profit Margin': '-16.05%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-8.90%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '6.69'}}\n```",
