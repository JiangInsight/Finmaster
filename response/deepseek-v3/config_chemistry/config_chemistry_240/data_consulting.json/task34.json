                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand each component before plugging in the numbers.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,900,875.61\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n\nCalculation:\n= -4,900,875.61 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ -1.43\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Debt / Total Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 3,428,090.41\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,657,959.24\n\nCalculation:\n= 3,428,090.41 / 11,657,959.24 ≈ 0.29\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Total Revenue (Net Sales) = 8,361,807.77\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n- End Total Assets = 15,086,049.65\n- Average Total Assets = (Initial + End) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 15,086,049.65) / 2 = 14,043,024.825\n\nCalculation:\n= 8,361,807.77 / 14,043,024.825 ≈ 0.60\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:**  \n(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 8,538,597.02\n- Inventory = 4,530,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n\nCalculation:\n= (8,538,597.02 - 4,530,000.00) / 3,428,090.41\n= 4,008,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ 1.17\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nThis is the same as the first ratio we calculated:\n= -4,900,875.61 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ -1.43\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\n**Formula:**  \nNet Income / Average Shareholder's Equity\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit (Net Income) = -1,342,040.76\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.00\n- End Owner's Equity = 11,657,959.24\n- Average Equity = (Initial + End) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 11,657,959.24) / 2 = 12,328,979.62\n\nCalculation:\n= -1,342,040.76 / 12,328,979.62 ≈ -0.1089 or -10.89%\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nNet Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\nAssuming all sales are credit sales (since no info on cash sales):\n- Net Sales = 8,361,807.77\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n- End Accounts Receivable = 2,498,141.24\n- Average AR = (Initial + End) / 2 = (0 + 2,498,141.24) / 2 = 1,249,070.62\n\nCalculation:\n= 8,361,807.77 / 1,249,070.62 ≈ 6.69\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.43', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.29', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.60', 'Quick Ratio': '1.17', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.43', 'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-10.89%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '6.69'}}\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me quickly verify a couple of these to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Quick Ratio:** (8,538,597.02 - 4,530,000) = 4,008,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ 1.17 ✔\n- **ROE:** -1,342,040.76 / ((13,000,000 + 11,657,959.24)/2) = -1,342,040.76 / 12,328,979.62 ≈ -0.1089 or -10.89% ✔\n- **AR Turnover:** 8,361,807.77 / 1,249,070.62 ≈ 6.69 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The negative values for operating cash flow ratios indicate that the company's operating cash flow is negative relative to its current liabilities, which isn't ideal. The ROE is also negative, showing a loss relative to equity. The quick ratio is above 1, indicating the company can cover its current liabilities without selling inventory. The AR turnover is high, suggesting efficient collection of receivables.",
