                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Current Ratio based on the given balance sheet data. \n\n### Understanding the Current Ratio\nFirst, I recall that the **Current Ratio** is a financial metric used to assess a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations (liabilities due within a year) with its short-term assets (assets expected to be converted to cash within a year). \n\nThe formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Relevant Data\nFrom the provided balance sheet, I need to find:\n1. **Total Current Assets**\n2. **Total Current Liabilities**\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Total Current Assets**: \n  - The row labeled \"Total Current Assets\" shows an \"End_amount\" of `8538597.02` as of `2024-01-28`.\n  \n- **Total Current Liabilities**: \n  - The row labeled \"Total Current Liabilities\" shows an \"End_amount\" of `3428090.41` as of `2024-01-28`.\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{8538597.02}{3428090.41} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\nFirst, divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\\[ 8538597.02 ÷ 3428090.41 ≈ 2.491 \\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **2.49**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nJust to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let's double-check:\n\n- Total Current Assets: 8,538,597.02\n- Total Current Liabilities: 3,428,090.41\n\nDivide:\n8,538,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ 2.491\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Current Ratio is **2.49**. \n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.49'} }\n```",
