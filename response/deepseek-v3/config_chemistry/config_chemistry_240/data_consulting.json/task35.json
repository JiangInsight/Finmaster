                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'll go through each ratio one by one, explaining how to calculate it and then applying the numbers from the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** Current Ratio measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 8,538,597.02\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 3,428,090.41\n\n\\[ \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{8,538,597.02}{3,428,090.41} \\approx 2.49 \\]\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Definition:** Gross Profit Margin shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 1,641,807.77\n- Total Revenue = 8,361,807.77\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,641,807.77}{8,361,807.77} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 19.63\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 3,428,090.41\n- Total Assets = 15,086,049.65\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,428,090.41}{15,086,049.65} \\approx 0.23 \\]\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** Net Profit Margin shows the percentage of revenue that remains as net profit after all expenses. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -1,342,040.76\n- Total Revenue = 8,361,807.77\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,342,040.76}{8,361,807.77} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx -16.05\\% \\]\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the ability to cover current liabilities with cash and cash equivalents. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 1,379,124.39\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 126,796.33\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 1,379,124.39 + 126,796.33 = 1,505,920.72\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} = \\frac{1,505,920.72}{3,428,090.41} \\approx 0.44 \\]\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n**Definition:** Free Cash Flow is the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. It can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} + \\text{Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,900,875.61\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = -1,593,203.67\n\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = -4,900,875.61 + (-1,593,203.67) = -6,494,079.28 \\]\n\n(Note: This matches the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents at the bottom of the cash flow statement.)\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** ROA measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement and balance sheet:\n- Net Profit = -1,342,040.76\n- Total Assets (End_amount) = 15,086,049.65\n\n\\[ \\text{ROA} = \\left( \\frac{-1,342,040.76}{15,086,049.65} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx -8.90\\% \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nNow, compiling all these calculations into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.49', 'Gross Profit Margin': '19.63%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.23', 'Net Profit Margin': '-16.05%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '0.44', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-6494079.28', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-8.90%'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\nLet me quickly verify a couple of these to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Current Ratio:** 8,538,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ 2.49 ✔\n- **Gross Profit Margin:** (1,641,807.77 / 8,361,807.77) * 100 ≈ 19.63% ✔\n- **ROA:** (-1,342,040.76 / 15,086,049.65) * 100 ≈ -8.90% ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The calculations seem correct based on the provided financial statements.",
