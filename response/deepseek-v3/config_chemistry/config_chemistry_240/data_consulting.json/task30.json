                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 8,538,597.02\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 3,428,090.41\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 8,538,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ 2.49\n\n### 2. Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)\n**Formula:** Quick Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand = 1,379,124.39\n- Bank Deposits = 126,796.33\n- Interest Receivable = 4,535.06\n- Accounts Receivable = 2,498,141.24\n- Total Quick Assets = 1,379,124.39 + 126,796.33 + 4,535.06 + 2,498,141.24 = 4,008,597.02\n- Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = 4,008,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ 1.17\n\n*Note:* Inventory is excluded from quick assets.\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 3,428,090.41\n- Total Assets = 15,086,049.65\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 3,428,090.41 / 15,086,049.65 ≈ 0.23\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,657,959.24\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 3,428,090.41 / 11,657,959.24 ≈ 0.29\n\n### 5. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4,900,875.61\n- Total Debt = Total Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -4,900,875.61 / 3,428,090.41 ≈ -1.43\n\n*Note:* A negative ratio indicates that the company's operating cash flow is negative, which isn't favorable for covering debt.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.49', 'Quick Ratio': '1.17', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.23', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.29', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.43'} }\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Current Ratio:**\n   - 8,538,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 = 2.49 (correct)\n\n2. **Quick Ratio:**\n   - Quick Assets = 1,379,124.39 + 126,796.33 + 4,535.06 + 2,498,141.24 = 4,008,597.02\n   - 4,008,597.02 / 3,428,090.41 = 1.17 (correct)\n\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio:**\n   - 3,428,090.41 / 15,086,049.65 = 0.23 (correct)\n\n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - 3,428,090.41 / 11,657,959.24 = 0.29 (correct)\n\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:**\n   - -4,900,875.61 / 3,428,090.41 = -1.43 (correct)\n\nEverything checks out! The ratios are calculated correctly based on the provided financial data.",
