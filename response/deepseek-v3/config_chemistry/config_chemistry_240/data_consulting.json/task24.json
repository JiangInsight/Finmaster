                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate two ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 3,428,090.41\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n- Total Assets (End_amount): 15,086,049.65\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,428,090.41}{15,086,049.65} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,428,090.41}{15,086,049.65} \\approx 0.227 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.23\n\nBut looking at the example provided, the ratio was given to two decimal places without a leading zero, so '0.23'.\n\nWait, let me check the example's calculation to ensure consistency.\n\nIn the example:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Total Assets: 13,216,409.49\n- Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.1409 → '0.14'\n\nSo, similarly, here it's 3,428,090.41 / 15,086,049.65 ≈ 0.227 → '0.23'\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the operating cash flow to the net income, indicating how much cash is generated from operations relative to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit (Net Income)}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,900,875.61\n- Net Profit: -1,342,040.76\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{-1,342,040.76} \\]\n\nNegative divided by negative is positive:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,900,875.61}{1,342,040.76} \\approx 3.651 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 3.65\n\nAgain, referring to the example:\n- Operating Cash Flow: -7,259,994.10\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nSo, similarly here, it's 3.65.\n\nBut wait, let's compute it more precisely:\n\n4,900,875.61 / 1,342,040.76:\n\n1,342,040.76 * 3 = 4,026,122.28\nRemaining: 4,900,875.61 - 4,026,122.28 = 874,753.33\n1,342,040.76 * 0.65 ≈ 872,326.49\nClose enough to 3.65.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.23', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.65'}}\n```\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio was '4.41' where both numbers were negative, similar to our case where both are negative giving a positive ratio. \n\nBut in our calculation, the absolute values give approximately 3.65, which seems correct based on the numbers provided.\n\nLet me recheck the numbers:\n\nNet Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,900,875.61\nNet Profit: -1,342,040.76\n\nAbsolute values: 4,900,875.61 / 1,342,040.76 ≈ 3.651\n\nSo, '3.65' seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, Debt to Asset Ratio is correctly calculated as '0.23'.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.23', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.65'}}\n```",
