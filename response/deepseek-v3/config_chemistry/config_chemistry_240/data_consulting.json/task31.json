                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle each of these financial ratios one by one. I'll go through the calculations step by step, making sure I understand where each number comes from in the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n\n**Given:**  \n- Net Credit Sales (assuming all Main Business Revenue is credit sales) = Main Business Revenue = 8,361,807.77  \n- Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (from Initial_amount in balance sheet)  \n- Ending Accounts Receivable = 2,498,141.24  \n\n**Average Accounts Receivable:**  \n= (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2  \n= (0 + 2,498,141.24) / 2  \n= 1,249,070.62  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n= 8,361,807.77 / 1,249,070.62  \n≈ 6.70\n\n*Wait a minute, in the example provided, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio was calculated differently. The example had Accounts Receivable at the end but not at the beginning, similar to this problem, and they got 4.47. Maybe they didn't average but used ending AR directly? Let me check.*\n\nAlternative approach: If we don't have beginning AR, sometimes only ending AR is used.  \n= Net Credit Sales / Ending AR  \n= 8,361,807.77 / 2,498,141.24  \n≈ 3.35\n\nHmm, neither matches the example's method. Maybe the example used average even though beginning was zero. Let's stick with average for now unless told otherwise.\n\nBut looking at the example:\nTheir Net Sales = 5,431,018.59  \nEnding AR = 2,429,482.13  \nAverage AR = (0 + 2,429,482.13)/2 = 1,214,741.065  \nRatio = 5,431,018.59 / 1,214,741.065 ≈ 4.47  \nWhich matches their answer. So they did use average even with beginning zero.\n\nSo for our case:\n= 8,361,807.77 / 1,249,070.62 ≈ 6.70\n\nBut let me double-check the numbers to ensure no mistake.\n\nYes, Main Business Revenue is 8,361,807.77  \nAverage AR is (0 + 2,498,141.24)/2 = 1,249,070.62  \n8,361,807.77 / 1,249,070.62 ≈ 6.695 ≈ 6.70\n\nOkay, so 6.70 seems correct unless there's another way.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\n**Given:**  \n- Operating Cash Flow (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities) = -4,900,875.61  \n- Current Liabilities (Total Current Liabilities) = 3,428,090.41  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n= -4,900,875.61 / 3,428,090.41  \n≈ -1.43\n\nIn the example, their operating cash flow was -7,259,994.10 and current liabilities were 1,861,550.92, giving -3.90. So method seems correct.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis seems identical to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the example (both were -3.90 in the example). Maybe it's the same thing with a different name.\n\nSo same calculation:\n= -4,900,875.61 / 3,428,090.41  \n≈ -1.43\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nTotal Asset Turnover Ratio = Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\n**Given:**  \n- Net Sales (Total Revenue) = 8,361,807.77  \n- Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00  \n- Ending Total Assets = 15,086,049.65  \n\n**Average Total Assets:**  \n= (Beginning + Ending) / 2  \n= (13,000,000 + 15,086,049.65) / 2  \n= 28,086,049.65 / 2  \n= 14,043,024.825  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n= 8,361,807.77 / 14,043,024.825  \n≈ 0.595\n\nIn the example, their Total Revenue was 5,431,018.59, Average Assets = (13,000,000 + 13,216,409.49)/2 = 13,108,204.745  \nRatio = 5,431,018.59 / 13,108,204.745 ≈ 0.41  \nSo method seems correct.\n\nOur calculation: ≈ 0.595 ≈ 0.60\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\n**Given:**  \n- Total Liabilities (Total Current Liabilities, since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 3,428,090.41  \n- Total Shareholders' Equity (Total Owner's Equity) = 11,657,959.24  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n= 3,428,090.41 / 11,657,959.24  \n≈ 0.294 ≈ 0.29\n\nIn the example, their Total Liabilities were 1,861,550.92, Equity was 11,354,858.57  \nRatio = 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 ≈ 0.16  \nSo method seems correct.\n\nOur calculation: ≈ 0.29\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '6.70', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.43', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.43', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.60', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.29'} }\n```\n\n*Wait, looking back at the example, their operating cash flow ratio and operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio were the same, which matches our approach. But their Accounts Receivable Turnover was lower, possibly because sales were lower relative to AR. Our calculations seem correct based on the formulas.*\n\n*Also, the Total Asset Turnover in the example was 0.41 with lower sales and similar assets, our higher sales give a higher ratio, which makes sense. Debt to Equity is higher here because liabilities are higher relative to equity compared to the example.*\n\nSo, final answer is as above.",
