In this case, it's the \"Total Current Liabilities\" because there are no non-current liabilities listed.\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 3,428,090.41\n\n2. **Identify Total Assets**: This is already provided in the balance sheet.\n   - Total Assets = 15,086,049.65\n\n3. **Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio**: This ratio is calculated by dividing Total Liabilities by Total Assets.\n   - Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n   - Debt to Asset Ratio = 3,428,090.41 / 15,086,049.65\n\n4. **Compute the Ratio**:\n   - 3,428,090.41 ÷ 15,086,049.65 ≈ 0.2272\n\n5. **Round the Ratio**: Typically, this ratio is rounded to two decimal places.\n   - 0.2272 rounded to two decimal places is 0.23.\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.23'} }\n```",
