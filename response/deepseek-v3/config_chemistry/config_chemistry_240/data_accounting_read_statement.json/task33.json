In the given problem, this is clearly labeled as \"Main Business Revenue\" with an amount of 8361807.77.\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. In the given problem, this is labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with an amount of 6720000.00.\n\nBoth of these line items are listed in the original order as they appear in the income statement: \"Main Business Revenue\" first, followed by \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '8361807.77', 'value2': '6720000.00'}}\n```",
