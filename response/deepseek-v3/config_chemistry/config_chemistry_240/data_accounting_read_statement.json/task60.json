                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what we're being asked to do and how to find the correct answers.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe have three financial statements provided:\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n2. **Income Statement**\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**\n\nOur goal is to extract two specific line items and their end values:\n1. **Funds deposited into a bank**: This likely refers to the \"Bank Deposits\" line item in the Balance Sheet.\n2. **Income earned by an entity from financial assets**: This probably refers to \"Interest Income\" from the Income Statement, as interest is typically earned from financial assets like deposits or investments.\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by the financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. However, since we're only extracting two values (Bank Deposits and Interest Income), and they're from the Balance Sheet and Income Statement respectively, the Cash Flow Statement might not be directly involved here unless there's another relevant line item.\n\nLooking at the example provided:\n- The solution was `{'value1': '164645.57', 'value2': '2672.87'}`.\n  - `value1` corresponds to \"Bank Deposits\" from the Balance Sheet.\n  - `value2` corresponds to \"Interest Income\" from the Income Statement.\n\nSo, following the same pattern, we'll look for:\n1. \"Bank Deposits\" in the Balance Sheet's \"End_amount\" column.\n2. \"Interest Income\" in the Income Statement's \"Amount\" column.\n\n### Extracting the Required Values\n\nLet's go through the provided problem:\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking for \"Bank Deposits\":\n```\n| Bank Deposits | 5000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 126796.33 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" is `126796.33`. So, `value1 = '126796.33'`.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\nLooking for \"Interest Income\":\n```\n| Interest Income | 4535.06 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nThe \"Amount\" is `4535.06`. So, `value2 = '4535.06'`.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nIn the example, the Cash Flow Statement wasn't used for the two values, but let's check if there's anything relevant here that might be needed. The line items related to interest or bank deposits are:\n- \"(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\": `-4535.06` (this is the change in interest receivable, not the income)\n- No direct \"Bank Deposits\" line here.\n\nSo, it seems we don't need anything from the Cash Flow Statement for this task.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nIn the example:\n- `value1` was \"Bank Deposits\" from Balance Sheet.\n- `value2` was \"Interest Income\" from Income Statement.\nNo values were taken from Cash Flow.\n\nThis matches our approach.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above, the two values are:\n1. Bank Deposits (Balance Sheet): `126796.33`\n2. Interest Income (Income Statement): `4535.06`\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '126796.33', 'value2': '4535.06'} }\n```",
