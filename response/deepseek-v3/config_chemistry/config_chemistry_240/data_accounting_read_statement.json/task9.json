The line item that typically represents tax accrued but not yet paid is \"Taxes Payable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - In the balance sheet provided, look for the line item that corresponds to taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid. This is usually labeled as \"Taxes Payable\" under the liabilities section.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value and Date**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" column shows the value at the \"Initial_date.\" For \"Taxes Payable,\" the initial amount is `0.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value and Date**:\n   - The \"End_amount\" column shows the value at the \"End_date.\" For \"Taxes Payable,\" the end amount is `418090.41` as of `2024-01-28`.\n\n4. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - The initial value is `0.00` and the end value is `418090.41`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '418090.41'} }\n```",
