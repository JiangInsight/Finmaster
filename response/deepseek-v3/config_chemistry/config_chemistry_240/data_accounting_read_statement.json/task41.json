In cash flow statements, this is typically labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we look for a line item that matches this description. The line item is:\n   - \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of \"418090.41\" on the date \"2024-01-28\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**: This line item is indeed under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, which is the correct section for such adjustments related to accrued taxes.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"418090.41\", which represents the increase in tax payable (i.e., tax accrued but not yet paid).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '418090.41'} }\n```",
