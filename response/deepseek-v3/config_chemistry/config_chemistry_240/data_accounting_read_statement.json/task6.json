These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the balance sheet provided, the line item that represents tangible assets held for use in production, rental, or administrative purposes is \"Fixed Assets\". This is because fixed assets include property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) which are used in operations.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Fixed Assets\" is given as `5000000.00` on the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Fixed Assets\" is given as `6593203.67` on the end date `2024-01-28`.\n\n4. **Verify Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is also provided, but since the task asks for the value of tangible items (which is typically the gross value before depreciation), we should use the \"Fixed Assets\" value directly. However, if the task intended the net value (after depreciation), we would subtract the accumulated depreciation from the fixed assets. But based on the example provided, the solution used the \"Fixed Assets\" value directly, so we will do the same here.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '6593203.67'} }\n```",
