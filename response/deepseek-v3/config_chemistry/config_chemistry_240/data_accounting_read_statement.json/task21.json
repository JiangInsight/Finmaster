In an income statement, this is usually represented by the revenue from the main business operations.\n2. **Identifying the Line Item**: Looking at the provided income statement, the line item that represents income from core operating activities is \"Main Business Revenue\". This is because it directly relates to the primary business operations of the entity.\n3. **Extracting the Value**: The value associated with \"Main Business Revenue\" is \"8361807.77\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8361807.77'}}\n```",
