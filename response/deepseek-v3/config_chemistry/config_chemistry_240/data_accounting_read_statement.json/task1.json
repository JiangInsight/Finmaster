From the balance sheet provided, the relevant line items are \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" because these represent the cash available for daily operations.\n\n1. **Initial Value**: The initial amount of cash available is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" at the initial date (2023-12-31).\n   - Cash on Hand: 3000000.00\n   - Bank Deposits: 5000000.00\n   - Total Initial Value: 3000000.00 + 5000000.00 = 8000000.00\n\n2. **End Value**: The end amount of cash available is the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" at the end date (2024-01-28).\n   - Cash on Hand: 1379124.39\n   - Bank Deposits: 126796.33\n   - Total End Value: 1379124.39 + 126796.33 = 1505920.72\n\nHowever, the example provided in the task description only includes the \"Cash on Hand\" values in the solution, not the sum of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\". Following the example's approach, we will only consider the \"Cash on Hand\" values.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '1379124.39'} }\n```",
