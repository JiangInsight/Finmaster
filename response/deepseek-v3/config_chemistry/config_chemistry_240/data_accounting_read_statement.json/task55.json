This represents the tax liability at the end of the reporting period.\n\n3. **Check the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, there is a line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" with an amount of `418090.41`. This represents the change in tax payable during the reporting period.\n\n4. **Check the Income Statement**:\n   - In the income statement, there is a line item \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of `418090.41`. This represents the tax expense incurred during the reporting period.\n\n5. **Consistency Across Statements**:\n   - All three sections (balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) consistently report the tax amount as `418090.41`. This confirms that the total amount of tax expected to be paid or recovered is `418090.41`.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of the total amount of tax expected to be paid or recovered during the reporting period is `418090.41`.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '418090.41'} }\n```",
