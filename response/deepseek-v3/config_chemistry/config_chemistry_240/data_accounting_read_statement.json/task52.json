This represents the amount of money shareholders have invested in the company by purchasing shares.\n\n2. **Locate the Initial and Final Values**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, we can see the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item with both \"Initial_amount\" and \"End_amount\" values.\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Paid-in Capital\" is `13000000.00` as of the initial date `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Paid-in Capital\" is `13000000.00` as of the end date `2024-01-28`.\n\n3. **Verify No Changes**:\n   - The initial and end values for \"Paid-in Capital\" are the same (`13000000.00`), indicating no additional capital was contributed by shareholders during the period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
