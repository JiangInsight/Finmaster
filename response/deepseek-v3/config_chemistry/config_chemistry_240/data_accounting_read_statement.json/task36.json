This line item is typically labeled as \"Net Profit\" in the cash flow statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task asks for the profit after all expenses, which is the net profit. This is the amount left after deducting all operating costs, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization from total revenue.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item labeled \"Net Profit\" directly represents this amount.\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Net Profit\" in the given problem is \"-1342040.76\".\n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1342040.76'}}\n```",
