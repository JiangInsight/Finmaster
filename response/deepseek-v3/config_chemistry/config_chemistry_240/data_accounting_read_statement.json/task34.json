                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to look at the income statement provided and identify the three specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract three things from the income statement:\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities**: This typically refers to the total revenue generated from the main operations of the business.\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is usually the cost associated with the goods sold, often labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole**: These are the administrative expenses incurred in running the business.\n\n### Analyzing the Income Statement\nHere's the income statement we're working with:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 8361807.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Revenue | 8361807.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 6720000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Cost | 6720000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Gross Profit | 1641807.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 1597051.08 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Selling Expenses | 404114.07 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Depreciation | 45751.04 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Financial Expenses | 523376.99 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Expenses | 2570293.18 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Interest Income | 4535.06 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Profit Before Tax | -923950.35 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Tax Expense | 418090.41 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Profit | -1342040.76 | 2024-01-28 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Line Items\n\n1. **Total income from ordinary activities**:\n   - This is the revenue from the main business operations. In the table, we see \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue,\" both with the same amount. \"Total Revenue\" is a more comprehensive term that likely includes all ordinary income, so we'll use that.\n   - **Value**: 8361807.77\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold (COGS)**:\n   - This is the cost directly associated with producing the goods sold by the company. It's listed as \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n   - **Value**: 6720000.00\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration**:\n   - These are the administrative expenses. In the table, it's clearly labeled as \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n   - **Value**: 1597051.08\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking at the provided example:\n- 'value1' was \"Total Revenue\" (5431018.59)\n- 'value2' was \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (4410000.00)\n- 'value3' was \"Administrative Expenses\" (1425164.20)\n\nThis matches our understanding, confirming that we're on the right track.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the above analysis, the three values we need are:\n1. Total Revenue: 8361807.77\n2. Cost of Goods Sold: 6720000.00\n3. Administrative Expenses: 1597051.08\n\nHere's the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '8361807.77', 'value2': '6720000.00', 'value3': '1597051.08'}}\n```",
