This account represents interest that has been earned but not yet received. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Item**: Look for \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n2. **Extract Initial Value**: The initial amount for \"Interest Receivable\" is provided in the balance sheet under \"Initial_amount\".\n3. **Extract End Value**: The end amount for \"Interest Receivable\" is provided in the balance sheet under \"End_amount\".\n\nFrom the balance sheet provided:\n- Initial_amount for \"Interest Receivable\": 0.00\n- End_amount for \"Interest Receivable\": 4535.06\n\nThus, the initial value is '0.00' and the end value is '4535.06'.\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '4535.06'} }\n```",
