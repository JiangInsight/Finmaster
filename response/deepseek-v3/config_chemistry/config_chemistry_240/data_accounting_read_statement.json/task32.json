                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify the specific line item that represents the profit an entity retains after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, have been deducted from total revenue. This line item is \"Net Profit\" in the given income statement. \n\nNext, we decompose this \"Net Profit\" into 5 component sub-items that are involved in its calculation. These sub-items should originate from the input statement and represent the initial and final values that contribute to the net profit. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Profit**: The net profit is given as \"-1342040.76\".\n2. **Identify the components involved in calculating Net Profit**:\n   - **Total Revenue**: This is the starting point for calculating profit. Here, it is \"8361807.77\".\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold**: This is subtracted from total revenue to get gross profit. Here, it is \"6720000.00\".\n   - **Total Expenses**: This includes all operating and other expenses (administrative, selling, depreciation, financial expenses). Here, it is \"2570293.18\".\n   - **Interest Income**: This is added to the profit before tax. Here, it is \"4535.06\".\n   - **Tax Expense**: This is subtracted from the profit before tax to get net profit. Here, it is \"418090.41\".\n\n3. **Verify the calculation**:\n   - Gross Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold = 8361807.77 - 6720000.00 = 1641807.77\n   - Profit Before Tax = Gross Profit - Total Expenses + Interest Income = 1641807.77 - 2570293.18 + 4535.06 = -923950.35\n   - Net Profit = Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense = -923950.35 - 418090.41 = -1342040.76\n\nThe calculation matches the given net profit, confirming that the identified sub-items are correct.\n\nHere is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1342040.76', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8361807.77', 'sub_item value2': '6720000.00', 'sub_item value3': '2570293.18', 'sub_item value4': '4535.06', 'sub_item value5': '418090.41'}}}\n```",
