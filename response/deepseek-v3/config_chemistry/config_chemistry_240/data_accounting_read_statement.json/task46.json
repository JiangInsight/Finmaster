I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nThe task is about analyzing a cash flow statement to extract specific information related to investing activities. Here's what we need to do:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents from Investing Activities**: This is the total cash flow generated or used in investing activities.\n2. **Decompose this Item into 1 Component Sub-item**: This means we need to find one specific line item that contributes to the net cash flow from investing activities.\n3. **Output the Values**: For both the net amount and the sub-item, we need to provide their final values.\n\n### Given Cash Flow Statement\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Profit  | -1342040.76 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Depreciation  | 45751.04 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -2498141.24 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -4535.06 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -4530000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 3010000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 418090.41 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -4900875.61 | 2024-01-28 |\n| **Cash Flow from Investing Activities** |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| **Purchase of Fixed Assets**  | **1593203.67** | 2024-01-28 |\n| **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**  | **-1593203.67** | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Ending Balance  | 1505920.72 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Increase  | -6494079.28 | 2024-01-28 |\n\n### Identifying the Required Items\n\n1. **Net Amount of Cash from Investing Activities**: This is clearly labeled as \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" with a value of \"-1593203.67\".\n   \n2. **Component Sub-item**: The investing activities section has one line item: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of \"1593203.67\". This is the sub-item that makes up the net cash flow from investing activities.\n\n   - The net cash flow is negative because purchasing fixed assets is a cash outflow (money spent).\n   - The sub-item is the positive amount spent on fixed assets, which when considered as an outflow, makes the net cash flow negative.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the provided example:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: \"-305354.43\"\n- Sub-item: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"305354.43\"\n\nThis matches our understanding where the sub-item is the positive amount spent, and the net is the negative of that (since it's an outflow).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on this, the solution is:\n\n- 'value': Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = \"-1593203.67\"\n- 'sub_items_sub_item value': Purchase of Fixed Assets = \"1593203.67\"\n\n### JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1593203.67', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '1593203.67'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Locate Investing Activities Section**: Found under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n2. **Identify Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: \"-1593203.67\".\n3. **Find Sub-items Under Investing Activities**: Only \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is listed with \"1593203.67\".\n4. **Understand the Relationship**:\n   - Purchase of assets is a cash outflow, hence negative impact on cash flow.\n   - The net is the sum of all investing activities, here just the negative of the purchase amount.\n5. **Construct the Answer**:\n   - 'value' is the net cash flow from investing activities.\n   - 'sub_items_sub_item value' is the purchase amount (positive, as it's the actual expenditure).\n\nThus, the final answer is correctly represented in the JSON format above.",
