This represents the interest accrued but not yet received.\n\n2. **Identify Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents in the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the Cash Flow Statement provided, under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, there is a line item \"Net Increase\" with an \"Amount\" of `-6494079.28`. This represents the net addition (or reduction) in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n3. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - The first value (`value1`) is the \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet: `4535.06`.\n   - The second value (`value2`) is the \"Net Increase\" from the Cash Flow Statement: `-6494079.28`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '4535.06', 'value2': '-6494079.28'}}\n```",
