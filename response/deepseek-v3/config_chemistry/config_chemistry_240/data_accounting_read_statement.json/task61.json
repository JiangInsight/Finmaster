I'm going to break it down to understand what we're being asked to do and then find the relevant information in the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract two specific line items and their values from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**\n2. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**\n\nThese should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\nFrom the example provided, it seems that:\n- The first value (`value1`) corresponds to \"Selling Expenses\" from the Income Statement, which likely includes costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods/services.\n- The second value (`value2`) corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" from the Cash Flow Statement, which represents cash payments for long-term assets.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's look at the financial statements provided in the problem to find these two items.\n\n#### 1. Income Statement\n\nLooking at the Income Statement section, we have:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 8361807.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Revenue | 8361807.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 6720000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Cost | 6720000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Gross Profit | 1641807.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 1597051.08 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Selling Expenses | 404114.07 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Depreciation | 45751.04 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Financial Expenses | 523376.99 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Expenses | 2570293.18 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Interest Income | 4535.06 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Profit Before Tax | -923950.35 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Tax Expense | 418090.41 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Profit | -1342040.76 | 2024-01-28 |\n\nHere, \"Selling Expenses\" is listed with an amount of `404114.07`. This likely represents the costs to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n\n#### 2. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, let's look at the Cash Flow Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Profit  | -1342040.76 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Depreciation  | 45751.04 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -2498141.24 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -4535.06 | 2024-01-28 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -4530000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 3010000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 418090.41 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -4900875.61 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 1593203.67 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -1593203.67 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Ending Balance  | 1505920.72 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Increase  | -6494079.28 | 2024-01-28 |\n\nHere, \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is listed with an amount of `1593203.67`. This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment (long-term assets).\n\n#### Balance Sheet\n\nThe Balance Sheet is also provided, but based on the example, the required values weren't extracted from there. It seems the Balance Sheet doesn't directly contain the line items we're interested in for this task. So, we'll focus on the Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\n- `value1` was \"Selling Expenses\" from the Income Statement (`493854.67`).\n- `value2` was \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" from the Cash Flow Statement (`305354.43`).\n\nThis aligns with our understanding.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nFrom the problem to solve:\n\n1. **Costs to secure orders and deliver goods/services**: \"Selling Expenses\" = `404114.07`\n2. **Cash payments for long-term assets**: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" = `1593203.67`\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '404114.07', 'value2': '1593203.67'}}\n```",
