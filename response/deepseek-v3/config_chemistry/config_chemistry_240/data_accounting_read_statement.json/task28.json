In income statements, this is typically labeled as \"Tax Expense\" or \"Income Tax Expense.\"\n\n2. **Review the Income Statement**: Look through the provided income statement to locate the line item related to taxes.\n\n3. **Locate the Tax Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Tax Expense\" is present with an amount of \"418090.41\" and a date of \"2024-01-28.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Tax Expense\" line item appears after \"Profit Before Tax\" and before \"Net Profit,\" which is the standard placement for tax-related items in an income statement. This confirms that \"Tax Expense\" is the correct line item to extract.\n\n5. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Tax Expense\" is \"418090.41.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '418090.41'} }\n```",
