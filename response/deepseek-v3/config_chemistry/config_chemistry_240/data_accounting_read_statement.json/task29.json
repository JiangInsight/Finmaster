Additionally, we need to decompose this item into 1 component sub-item, all of which must also originate from the input statement. For each sub-item, we will output its initial and final values.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Total Income from Ordinary Activities**: \n   - The total income from ordinary activities is typically represented by \"Total Revenue\" in the income statement. \n   - In the given problem, \"Total Revenue\" is listed with an amount of \"8361807.77\".\n\n2. **Identify Constituent Line Items**:\n   - The constituent line item that makes up the \"Total Revenue\" is \"Main Business Revenue\", which is also \"8361807.77\". This indicates that \"Main Business Revenue\" is the sole component of \"Total Revenue\" in this case.\n\n3. **Decompose into 1 Sub-Item**:\n   - The sub-item to be extracted is \"Main Business Revenue\", which has the same value as \"Total Revenue\". \n   - The initial and final values of the sub-item are both \"8361807.77\" since there is only one component.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"value\": \"8361807.77\", \"sub_items\": {\"sub_item value\": \"8361807.77\"}}}\n```",
