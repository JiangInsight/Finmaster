These assets are typically categorized as \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents assets held for sale or in production is \"Inventory\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value of \"Inventory\" is listed as \"0.00\" under the \"Initial_amount\" column with the \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value of \"Inventory\" is listed as \"4530000.00\" under the \"End_amount\" column with the \"End_date\" of \"2024-01-28\".\n\n4. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The \"Inventory\" line item fits the description of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, as it is a current asset directly related to the company's operations.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '4530000.00'} }\n```",
