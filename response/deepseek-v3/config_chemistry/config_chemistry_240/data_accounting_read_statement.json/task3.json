This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Receivable\" represents amounts owed to the entity by customers for goods or services sold on credit. This is the item we are interested in.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, locate the \"Accounts Receivable\" row.\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" column shows the value at the start of the period (initial value).\n   - The \"End_amount\" column shows the value at the end of the period (end value).\n\n3. **Values from the Given Problem**:\n   - Initial_amount for \"Accounts Receivable\": `0.00` (as of `2023-12-31`).\n   - End_amount for \"Accounts Receivable\": `2498141.24` (as of `2024-01-28`).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2498141.24'} }\n```",
