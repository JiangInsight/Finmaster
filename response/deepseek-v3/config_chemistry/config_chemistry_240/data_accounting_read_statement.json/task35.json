I'm going to go through the income statement provided and identify the four specific line items we're interested in, along with their corresponding values.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to extract four specific line items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these are costs related to selling products or services, like advertising, sales commissions, and delivery costs.\n   \n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expense,\" which are costs related to borrowing money.\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is straightforward; it's \"Depreciation,\" which accounts for the wear and tear of assets over time.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is the \"Tax Expense,\" representing the taxes owed for the period.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Income Statement\n\nHere's the income statement we're working with:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 8361807.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Revenue | 8361807.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 6720000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Cost | 6720000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Gross Profit | 1641807.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 1597051.08 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Selling Expenses | 404114.07 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Depreciation | 45751.04 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Financial Expenses | 523376.99 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Expenses | 2570293.18 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Interest Income | 4535.06 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Profit Before Tax | -923950.35 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Tax Expense | 418090.41 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Profit | -1342040.76 | 2024-01-28 |\n\n### Identifying the Four Line Items\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: This is directly listed as \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of `404114.07`.\n   \n2. **Depreciation**: Listed as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of `45751.04`.\n   \n3. **Financial Expenses**: Listed as \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of `523376.99`.\n   \n4. **Tax Expense**: Listed as \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of `418090.41`.\n\n### Verifying Against the Example\n\nLooking at the example provided:\n\n- `value1`: Selling Expenses\n- `value2`: Depreciation\n- `value3`: Financial Expenses\n- `value4`: Tax Expense\n\nThis matches our understanding, so we'll follow the same order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPlugging in the values we've identified:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '404114.07', 'value2': '45751.04', 'value3': '523376.99', 'value4': '418090.41'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Selling Expenses (value1)**: Found as \"Selling Expenses\" → `404114.07`\n2. **Depreciation (value2)**: Found as \"Depreciation\" → `45751.04`\n3. **Financial Expenses (value3)**: Found as \"Financial Expenses\" → `523376.99`\n4. **Tax Expense (value4)**: Found as \"Tax Expense\" → `418090.41`\n\nAll values are correctly identified and placed in the specified order. \n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '404114.07', 'value2': '45751.04', 'value3': '523376.99', 'value4': '418090.41'}}\n```",
