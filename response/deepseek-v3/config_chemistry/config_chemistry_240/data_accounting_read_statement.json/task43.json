This is typically listed under the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section of the statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided problem, the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section is clearly marked. It includes the following line items:\n   - Beginning Balance\n   - Ending Balance\n   - Net Increase\n\n3. **Identify the Line Item**: The \"Beginning Balance\" line item directly represents the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period. \n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with the \"Beginning Balance\" is `8000000.00`.\n\n### Solution:\nThe value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is `8000000.00`. \n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
