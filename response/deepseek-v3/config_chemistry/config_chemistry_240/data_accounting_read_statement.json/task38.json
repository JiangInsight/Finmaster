This is typically reflected in the cash flow statement under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section as \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the line item that shows the change in accounts receivable, which indicates the decrease (or increase) in amounts owed to the entity for credit sales.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with this line item is \"-2498141.24.\" A negative value here typically indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., more amounts are owed to the entity), but the line item itself is labeled as \"(Increase) Decrease,\" so the value represents the change.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The value to be extracted is \"-2498141.24.\"\n\nHere is the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2498141.24'}}\n```",
