These are typically referred to as \"Current Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the normal operating cycle of the business. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all such assets.\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is `8000000.00` as of the \"Initial_date\" `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is `8538597.02` as of the \"End_date\" `2024-01-28`.\n\n3. **Exclude Non-Current Assets**: Fixed assets, accumulated depreciation, and total non-current assets are not part of the operating cycle and should not be included in the solution.\n\n4. **Verify**: The initial and end values for \"Total Current Assets\" are clearly listed in the balance sheet and match the criteria for assets expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8538597.02'}}\n```",
