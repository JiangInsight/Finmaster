Here's how we can extract the required information:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: The initial value of the total owner's equity is found in the \"Initial_amount\" column for the \"Total Owner's Equity\" row, which is `13000000.00`.\n2. **End Value**: The end value of the total owner's equity is found in the \"End_amount\" column for the \"Total Owner's Equity\" row, which is `11657959.24`.\n\nThus, the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '11657959.24'} }\n```",
