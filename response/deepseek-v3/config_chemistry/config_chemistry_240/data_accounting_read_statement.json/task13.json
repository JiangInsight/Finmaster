                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to identify and extract the specific line items and values of total assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle. These are typically non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets, long-term investments, and intangible assets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Criteria**: \n   - Non-current assets are not expected to be realized (converted into cash) or consumed within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Total Non-current Assets\" fit this criteria.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Items**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, the line items under \"Total Non-current Assets\" are:\n     - Fixed Assets\n     - Accumulated Depreciation\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line summarizes these items.\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The initial value of \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `5000000.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - The end value of \"Total Non-current Assets\" is `6547452.63` as of `2024-01-28`.\n\n4. **Verify**:\n   - The initial and end values are directly taken from the \"Total Non-current Assets\" line in the balance sheet, which aligns with the task's requirements.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '6547452.63'} }\n```",
