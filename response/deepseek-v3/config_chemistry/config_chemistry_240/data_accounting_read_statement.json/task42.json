This is typically found under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section in a cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section contains the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which represents cash payments for acquiring PP&E and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `1593203.67`.\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is `-1593203.67`, which matches the negative of the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" value, confirming that this is the only cash outflow in the investing activities section.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1593203.67'} }\n```",
