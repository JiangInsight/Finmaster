I'm going to break it down to understand what we're being asked to do and then extract the necessary information from the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities**: This is the cash flow from the entity's principal revenue-producing activities and other activities that are not investing or financing activities. Essentially, it's the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n2. **Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid**: This would be the \"Taxes Payable\" in the Balance Sheet, representing taxes that have been incurred but not yet paid.\n\n3. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities**: This is the total revenue from the entity's main operations, which is typically the \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue\" in the Income Statement.\n\nThe order in which we present these values is important:\n1. Balance Sheet (Taxes Payable)\n2. Income Statement (Total Revenue)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities)\n\n### Extracting the Values\n\nLet's go through each financial statement to find these items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\nWe're looking for \"Taxes Payable\":\n```\n| Taxes Payable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 418090.41 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nThe \"End_amount\" is `418090.41`. This is our first value (`value1`).\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\nWe're looking for \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue\":\n```\n| Main Business Revenue | 8361807.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Total Revenue | 8361807.77 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nBoth \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" have the same amount here, which is `8361807.77`. This is our second value (`value2`).\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nWe're looking for \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\":\n```\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -4900875.61 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nThe amount is `-4900875.61`. This is our third value (`value3`).\n\n### Verifying the Order\n\nJust to ensure we're following the correct order:\n1. Balance Sheet: Taxes Payable → `418090.41`\n2. Income Statement: Total Revenue → `8361807.77`\n3. Cash Flow Statement: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities → `-4900875.61`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '418090.41', 'value2': '8361807.77', 'value3': '-4900875.61'}}\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- **value1 (Taxes Payable)**: Found in the Balance Sheet under \"Taxes Payable\" with the end amount `418090.41`.\n- **value2 (Total Revenue)**: Found in the Income Statement under \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue\" with the amount `8361807.77`.\n- **value3 (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities)**: Found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\" with the amount `-4900875.61`.\n\nThis matches the order and the requirements specified in the task description.",
