This refers to the depreciation expense recorded in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Depreciation**: Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. It is recorded as an expense in the income statement and also appears in the accumulated depreciation line in the balance sheet and the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locating Depreciation in the Financial Statements**:\n   - **Income Statement**: The income statement directly lists \"Depreciation\" as an expense. In the provided problem, the income statement shows a depreciation expense of `45751.04` on `2024-01-28`.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: The cash flow statement also lists \"Depreciation\" under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" with the same value of `45751.04` on `2024-01-28`.\n   - **Balance Sheet**: The balance sheet shows \"Accumulated Depreciation\" under \"Total Non-current Assets\" with an end amount of `45751.04` on `2024-01-28`. This represents the total depreciation accumulated up to that date.\n\n3. **Verification**: The depreciation value is consistent across all three statements (`45751.04`), confirming that this is the correct value to extract.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is `45751.04`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45751.04'}}\n```",
