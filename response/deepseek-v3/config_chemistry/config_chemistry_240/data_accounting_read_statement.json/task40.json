This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are looking for the amount that represents the increase in accounts payable, which is the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is found under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value corresponding to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is \"3010000.00\".\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The positive value indicates an increase in accounts payable, which aligns with the task description of identifying the addition in the amount owed.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3010000.00'} }\n```",
