In accounting terms, this is typically represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item in the income statement. COGS reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n\n2. **Review the Given Income Statement**: The income statement provided includes several line items. We are looking for the line item labeled \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or a similar term that represents the cost of inventories sold.\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: In the given income statement, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is present with an amount of \"6720000.00\" for the date \"2024-01-28\".\n\n4. **Verify the Line Item**: The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is indeed the correct line item that represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period. No other line item in the statement fits this description better.\n\n5. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \"6720000.00\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6720000.00'} }\n```",
