                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need to extract.\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to identify and extract three specific values from the financial statements:\n1. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares** (from the Balance Sheet).\n2. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense** (from the Income Statement).\n3. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period** (from the Cash Flow Statement).\n\nThe order is important: Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet - Capital Contributed by Shareholders\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we're interested in the capital that shareholders have contributed in exchange for shares. This is typically labeled as \"Paid-in Capital\" or \"Share Capital.\"\n\nFrom the given Balance Sheet:\n```\nPaid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nThis shows that the capital contributed by shareholders is `13,000,000.00` at both the start and end of the period. Since there's no change, the amount is `13000000.00`.\n\n**Value1: '13000000.00'**\n\n### 2. Income Statement - Profit Before Tax\nNext, from the Income Statement, we need the profit or loss before tax expense. This is usually labeled as \"Profit Before Tax\" or \"Income Before Tax.\"\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n```\nProfit Before Tax | -923950.35 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nThis is the profit (or in this case, loss) before tax is deducted. \n\n**Value2: '-923950.35'**\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement - Increase in Accounts Payable\nNow, from the Cash Flow Statement, we need the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period. This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable,\" which is money the company owes to its suppliers.\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n```\nIncrease (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 3010000.00 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\nThis shows that Accounts Payable increased by `3,010,000.00` during the period, meaning the company owes more to its suppliers now than at the start.\n\n**Value3: '3010000.00'**\n\n### Verifying the Order\nLet's ensure we're following the correct order:\n1. Balance Sheet (Paid-in Capital)\n2. Income Statement (Profit Before Tax)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Increase in Accounts Payable)\n\nThis matches the required order.\n\n### Final Answer\nCombining these, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-923950.35', 'value3': '3010000.00'}}\n```",
