Financing costs are typically listed as \"Financial Expenses\" in the income statement.\n\n2. **Reviewing the Income Statement**: The given income statement has a line item labeled \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of \"523376.99\" dated \"2024-01-28\".\n\n3. **Verification**: \n   - \"Financial Expenses\" are indeed the costs associated with raising funds (e.g., interest expenses on loans, fees for financial services).\n   - No other line items in the statement represent financing costs (e.g., \"Interest Income\" is income, not an expense).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The value of financing costs is correctly represented by the \"Financial Expenses\" line item.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '523376.99'}}\n```",
