Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the cash flow statement, depreciation is typically listed under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" as it is a non-cash expense added back to net profit.\n3. **Identify the Value**: From the given problem, the line item \"Depreciation\" has a value of \"45751.04\" on the date \"2024-01-28\".\n4. **Verify**: The example provided also shows that the solution is the value associated with the \"Depreciation\" line item, confirming our approach.\n\n### Solution:\nThe value to be extracted is \"45751.04\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45751.04'} }\n```",
