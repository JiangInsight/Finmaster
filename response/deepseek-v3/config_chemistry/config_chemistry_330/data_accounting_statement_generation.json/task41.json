These transactions represent the amounts that have not been paid yet and thus contribute to the accounts payable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Purchase Transactions:**\n   - Look for all transactions where:\n     - `type` is \"Purchase\"\n     - `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\"\n     - `payment_method` is \"Account Payable\"\n\n2. **Extract the Amounts:**\n   - For each such transaction, note the `amount` field, which represents the unpaid amount.\n\n3. **Sum the Unpaid Amounts:**\n   - Sum all the unpaid amounts to get the total increase in accounts payable.\n\n### Analysis of the Given Data:\nFrom the provided data, there is only one transaction that meets the criteria:\n- **Transaction ID:** Purchase20231231005\n  - `type`: Purchase\n  - `payment/receipt_status`: Unpaid\n  - `payment_method`: Account Payable\n  - `amount`: 2700000.0\n\n### Calculation:\n- Total Increase in Accounts Payable = 2700000.0\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '2700000.00'}}\n```",
