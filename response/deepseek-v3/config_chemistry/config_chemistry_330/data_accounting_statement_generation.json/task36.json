Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Profit Items**: \n   - Look for all transactions where the type is \"Sale\" and sum up the \"profit\" column values. These represent the profits from sales.\n\n2. **Identify Expense Items**:\n   - Sum up all transactions where the type is \"Expense\" (including Financial, Sales, and Administrative Expenses) and \"Depreciation\". These represent the costs incurred by the business.\n\n3. **Calculate Net Profit**:\n   - Net Profit = Total Profit from Sales - Total Expenses (including depreciation).\n\n4. **Exclude Non-Operating Items**:\n   - Initial deposits (Cash deposit, Bank deposit, Fixed Assets) are not part of the operating profit calculation.\n   - Interest Receivables are not part of the core operating profit calculation unless specified otherwise.\n\n### Calculations:\n\n1. **Total Profit from Sales**:\n   - Sum all \"profit\" values from \"Sale\" transactions.\n\n2. **Total Expenses**:\n   - Sum all \"amount\" values from \"Expense\" and \"Depreciation\" transactions.\n\n3. **Net Profit**:\n   - Subtract total expenses from total profit from sales.\n\n### Example Calculation (from the given data):\n\n- Total Profit from Sales: Sum of all \"profit\" values in \"Sale\" transactions.\n- Total Expenses: Sum of all \"amount\" values in \"Expense\" and \"Depreciation\" transactions.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the net profit is found to be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit': '-1645141.43'}}\n```",
