The inventory value is determined by the purchases and sales of products, considering the cost per unit and the quantity involved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Purchase Transactions**:\n   - We need to look for all transactions where the type is \"Purchase\". These transactions will give us the initial inventory value and any additional inventory added during the period.\n   - From the given data, the purchase transactions are:\n     - Purchase20231231001: 27 units of P002 at 20000.0 per unit → 27 * 20000 = 540,000\n     - Purchase20231231002: 25 units of P004 at 100000.0 per unit → 25 * 100000 = 2,500,000\n     - Purchase20231231003: 28 units of P001 at 10000.0 per unit → 28 * 10000 = 280,000\n     - Purchase20231231004: 24 units of P003 at 50000.0 per unit → 24 * 50000 = 1,200,000\n     - Purchase20231231005: 27 units of P004 at 100000.0 per unit → 27 * 100000 = 2,700,000 (Unpaid, but still part of inventory)\n     - Purchase20231231006: 26 units of P002 at 20000.0 per unit → 26 * 20000 = 520,000\n     - Purchase20231231007: 26 units of P003 at 50000.0 per unit → 26 * 50000 = 1,300,000\n     - Purchase20231231008: 12 units of P001 at 10000.0 per unit → 12 * 10000 = 120,000\n     - Purchase20231231009: 14 units of P001 at 10000.0 per unit → 14 * 10000 = 140,000\n\n2. **Calculate Total Purchases (Initial Inventory)**:\n   - Sum all purchase amounts:\n     - 540,000 + 2,500,000 + 280,000 + 1,200,000 + 2,700,000 + 520,000 + 1,300,000 + 120,000 + 140,000 = 9,300,000\n   - The initial inventory value is the sum of all purchases, which is 9,300,000.\n\n3. **Identify Sales Transactions**:\n   - We need to look for all transactions where the type is \"Sale\". These transactions will give us the quantity of inventory sold.\n   - From the given data, the sales transactions are:\n     - Sale20240103004: 1 unit of P001 → cost = 10000.0\n     - Sale20240104005: 1 unit of P004 → cost = 100000.0\n     - Sale20240104006: 2 units of P004 → cost = 2 * 100000 = 200,000\n     - Sale20240105008: 5 units of P002 → cost = 5 * 20000 = 100,000\n     - Sale20240105009: 3 units of P001 → cost = 3 * 10000 = 30,000\n     - Sale20240106010: 4 units of P002 → cost = 4 * 20000 = 80,000\n     - Sale20240106011: 3 units of P001 → cost = 3 * 10000 = 30,000\n     - Sale20240107013: 2 units of P002 → cost = 2 * 20000 = 40,000\n     - Sale20240108015: 3 units of P004 → cost = 3 * 100000 = 300,000\n     - Sale20240108016: 4 units of P004 → cost = 4 * 100000 = 400,000\n     - Sale20240109018: 3 units of P003 → cost = 3 * 50000 = 150,000\n     - Sale20240110019: 5 units of P003 → cost = 5 * 50000 = 250,000\n     - Sale20240112020: 4 units of P001 → cost = 4 * 10000 = 40,000\n     - Sale20240113021: 5 units of P003 → cost = 5 * 50000 = 250,000\n     - Sale20240113022: 4 units of P002 → cost = 4 * 20000 = 80,000\n     - Sale20240114024: 5 units of P004 → cost = 5 * 100000 = 500,000\n     - Sale20240116028: 2 units of P001 → cost = 2 * 10000 = 20,000\n     - Sale20240116029: 3 units of P001 → cost = 3 * 10000 = 30,000\n     - Sale20240117032: 2 units of P002 → cost = 2 * 20000 = 40,000\n     - Sale20240117033: 3 units of P003 → cost = 3 * 50000 = 150,000\n     - Sale20240118034: 5 units of P004 → cost = 5 * 100000 = 500,000\n     - Sale20240118035: 3 units of P002 → cost = 3 * 20000 = 60,000\n     - Sale20240119036: 4 units of P001 → cost = 4 * 10000 = 40,000\n     - Sale20240120038: 5 units of P001 → cost = 5 * 10000 = 50,000\n     - Sale20240120039: 1 unit of P001 → cost = 1 * 10000 = 10,000\n     - Sale20240121040: 3 units of P004 → cost = 3 * 100000 = 300,000\n     - Sale20240122041: 1 unit of P003 → cost = 1 * 50000 = 50,000\n     - Sale20240123043: 4 units of P003 → cost = 4 * 50000 = 200,000\n     - Sale20240123044: 2 units of P002 → cost = 2 * 20000 = 40,000\n     - Sale20240124046: 5 units of P004 → cost = 5 * 100000 = 500,000\n     - Sale20240125047: 2 units of P004 → cost = 2 * 100000 = 200,000\n     - Sale20240126048: 1 unit of P001 → cost = 1 * 10000 = 10,000\n     - Sale20240127049: 3 units of P003 → cost = 3 * 50000 = 150,000\n     - Sale20240127050: 3 units of P001 → cost = 3 * 10000 = 30,000\n     - Sale20240128052: 4 units of P002 → cost = 4 * 20000 = 80,000\n     - Sale20240129053: 5 units of P004 → cost = 5 * 100000 = 500,000\n\n4. **Calculate Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**:\n   - Sum all sales costs:\n     - 10000 + 100000 + 200000 + 100000 + 30000 + 80000 + 30000 + 40000 + 300000 + 400000 + 150000 + 250000 + 40000 + 250000 + 80000 + 500000 + 20000 + 30000 + 40000 + 150000 + 500000 + 60000 + 40000 + 50000 + 10000 + 300000 + 50000 + 200000 + 40000 + 500000 + 200000 + 10000 + 150000 + 30000 + 80000 + 500000 = 5,810,000\n\n5. **Calculate Ending Inventory**:\n   - Ending Inventory = Initial Inventory - COGS\n   - Ending Inventory = 9,300,000 - 5,810,000 = 3,490,000\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The initial inventory value is 9,300,000.\n   - The ending inventory value is 3,490,000.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '9300000.00', 'Inventory End Value': '3490000.00'}}\n```",
