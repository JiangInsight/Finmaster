The expenses are categorized into different types such as Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses, Financial Expenses, and Depreciation. \n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify all expense transactions**: These are the rows where the \"type\" field is one of the following:\n   - Administrative Expenses\n   - Sales Expenses\n   - Financial Expenses\n   - Depreciation\n\n2. **Sum the amounts of these transactions**: We will add up all the \"amount\" values from these rows.\n\n3. **Exclude non-expense transactions**: Transactions like \"Cash deposit\", \"Bank deposit\", \"Fixed Assets\", \"Purchase\", \"Sale\", \"Interest Receivables\", \"Fixed Assets Purchase\", and transfers should not be included in the total expenses.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total expenses from the given data:\n\n### Expense Transactions:\n1.
