In the given data, there are no depreciation entries before the first depreciation transaction on 2024-01-01. Therefore, the initial accumulated depreciation is **0.00**.\n\n2. **Identify Depreciation Transactions:**\n   - The only depreciation transaction in the given data is on 2024-01-01 with the ID \"Depreciation20240101001\" and an amount of **45765.700000000004**.\n\n3. **Calculate Accumulated Depreciation End Value:**\n   - Since there is only one depreciation transaction, the accumulated depreciation at the end of the period is simply the amount of this transaction, which is **45765.70**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45765.70'} }\n```",
