Depreciation is typically listed as an expense in the cash flow statement and is usually recorded under the \"Depreciation\" type in the transactions data.\n\nLooking at the provided data, we can see that there is a transaction with the type \"Depreciation\" and the ID \"Depreciation20240101001\". The amount for this transaction is \"45765.700000000004\".\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Scan through the transactions data to find entries with the type \"Depreciation\".\n2. Identify the relevant transaction: \"Depreciation20240101001\".\n3. Extract the amount from this transaction: \"45765.700000000004\".\n4. Round the amount to two decimal places for standard financial reporting: \"45765.70\".\n\nThus, the final depreciation item in the cash flow statement is \"45765.70\".\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45765.70'} }\n```",
