Depreciation is typically recorded as an expense in the income statement and is usually listed under \"Depreciation\" in the transaction type.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Depreciation Transactions**: Look through the transactions where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\". These entries represent the depreciation expense for the period.\n\n2. **Extract the Amount**: For each depreciation transaction, note the \"amount\" or \"recorded_amount\" (they should be the same for depreciation entries).\n\n3. **Sum the Depreciation Amounts**: If there are multiple depreciation entries, sum them up to get the total depreciation expense. However, in the given data, there is only one depreciation entry.\n\n4. **Locate the Depreciation Entry**: \n   - In the provided data, the depreciation entry is:\n     ```\n     | Depreciation20240101001 | Depreciation | 2024-01-01 | 2024-01-01 | 45765.700000000004 | 45765.700000000004 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n     ```\n   - The amount is `45765.700000000004`, which can be rounded to `45765.70` for simplicity.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The depreciation expense for the income statement is `45765.70`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45765.70'}}\n```",
