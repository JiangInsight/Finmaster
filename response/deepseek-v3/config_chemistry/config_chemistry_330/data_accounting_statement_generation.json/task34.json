Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Revenue Items (Sales):**\n   - These are transactions where the type is \"Sale\". We'll sum up the \"profit\" column for all sales transactions.\n\n2. **Identify Expense Items:**\n   - These include:\n     - Administrative Expenses\n     - Sales Expenses\n     - Financial Expenses\n     - Depreciation\n   - We'll sum up the \"amount\" column for all these expense transactions.\n\n3. **Identify Other Income Items:**\n   - Interest Receivables (though these are typically small and may not significantly impact the net profit).\n\n4. **Calculate Net Profit:**\n   - Net Profit = Total Revenue (from Sales) - Total Expenses + Other Income (Interest Receivables)\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Sum of Profit from Sales:**\n   - From the given data, we need to extract all rows where type is \"Sale\" and sum the \"profit\" column.\n   -
