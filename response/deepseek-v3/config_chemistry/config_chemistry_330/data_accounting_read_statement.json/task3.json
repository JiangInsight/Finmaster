This is typically labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The line item \"Accounts Receivable\" represents the amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit. This is the item we need to extract.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value and Date**:\n   - In the given problem, the \"Accounts Receivable\" line shows an \"Initial_amount\" of \"0.00\" with an \"Initial_date\" of \"2023-12-31\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value and Date**:\n   - The \"Accounts Receivable\" line shows an \"End_amount\" of \"3558301.64\" with an \"End_date\" of \"2024-01-29\".\n\n4. **Verify the Data**:\n   - The initial value is indeed \"0.00\" and the end value is \"3558301.64\", which aligns with the task description of extracting amounts owed for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3558301.64'} }\n```",
