I'm going to break it down to understand how to find the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, and then decompose it into two component sub-items.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's look at the cash flow statement provided. It's divided into three main sections:\n\n1. **Cash Flow From Operating Activities**: This shows how much cash is generated from the company's regular business operations.\n2. **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This shows cash used for or generated from investments like purchasing fixed assets.\n3. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: This section shows the beginning and ending balances of cash and the net increase or decrease during the period.\n\nOur main goal is to find the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents and then break it down into two sub-items that contribute to this net increase.\n\n### Identifying the Net Increase\n\nFrom the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, we can see:\n\n- **Beginning Balance**: 8,000,000.00\n- **Ending Balance**: 340,378.06\n- **Net Increase**: -7,659,621.94\n\nThis \"Net Increase\" is the net addition (or in this case, a decrease) in cash and cash equivalents during the period. \n\n### Decomposing the Net Increase\n\nThe net increase in cash and cash equivalents is calculated as:\n\n**Net Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance**\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nNet Increase = 340,378.06 - 8,000,000.00 = -7,659,621.94\n\nThis matches the given \"Net Increase\" value.\n\nNow, the two sub-items that make up this calculation are:\n\n1. **Beginning Balance**: The amount of cash at the start of the period.\n2. **Ending Balance**: The amount of cash at the end of the period.\n\nThese are the two components that, when subtracted (Ending - Beginning), give us the net increase.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n- Ending Balance: 434,651.47\n- Net Increase: -7,565,348.53\n\nCalculation: 434,651.47 - 8,000,000.00 = -7,565,348.53\n\nThe sub-items were the beginning and ending balances, which makes sense.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nFor our problem:\n\n- **value (Net Increase)**: -7,659,621.94\n- **sub_item value1 (Beginning Balance)**: 8,000,000.00\n- **sub_item value2 (Ending Balance)**: 340,378.06\n\n### JSON Format Solution\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7659621.94', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_item value2': '340378.06'}}}\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify the Net Increase**: Found in the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section as -7,659,621.94.\n2. **Understand the Calculation**: Net Increase = Ending Balance - Beginning Balance.\n3. **Find Sub-items**:\n   - Beginning Balance: 8,000,000.00\n   - Ending Balance: 340,378.06\n4. **Verify**: 340,378.06 - 8,000,000.00 = -7,659,621.94 (matches given Net Increase).\n5. **Format the Answer**: Present in the specified JSON structure.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify and decompose the net addition in cash and cash equivalents based on the provided financial statement.",
