I'm going to break it down to understand what each of the three values we need to extract represents and where to find them in the given financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit**: This typically refers to \"Accounts Receivable\" in the balance sheet. It's the money that customers owe the company for sales made on credit.\n\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" in the income statement. These are costs like interest on loans or other financing charges.\n\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets**: This is often found in the cash flow statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar headings. It represents the cash spent on buying long-term assets like machinery, buildings, etc.\n\nThe order in which we present these values is important: first from the Balance Sheet, then Income Statement, and finally Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Analyzing the Given Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each financial statement one by one to find these items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided, we have the following line items under \"Account\":\n\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- Interest Receivable\n- Accounts Receivable\n- Inventory\n- Total Current Assets\n- Fixed Assets\n- Accumulated Depreciation\n- Total Non-current Assets\n- Total Assets\n- Accounts Payable\n- Taxes Payable\n- Total Current Liabilities\n- Paid-in Capital\n- Retained Earnings\n- Total Owner's Equity\n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\n\nThe item we're interested in is \"Accounts Receivable\". Its \"End_amount\" is `3558301.64` as of `2024-01-29`.\n\nSo, **value1 = '3558301.64'**.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nNow, let's look at the income statement. The relevant line items are:\n\n- Main Business Revenue\n- Total Revenue\n- Cost of Goods Sold\n- Total Cost\n- Gross Profit\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Selling Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Financial Expenses\n- Total Expenses\n- Interest Income\n- Profit Before Tax\n- Tax Expense\n- Net Profit\n\nWe're looking for \"Financial Expenses\", which is `410850.65`.\n\nSo, **value2 = '410850.65'**.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nFinally, the cash flow statement has these line items under \"Account\":\n\n- Cash Flow From Operating Activities\n- Net Profit\n- Depreciation\n- (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n- (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n- (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n- Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n- Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents\n- Beginning Balance\n- Ending Balance\n- Net Increase\n\nThe relevant item here is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\", which is `2265288.42`.\n\nSo, **value3 = '2265288.42'**.\n\n### Verifying the Values\n\nLet me quickly verify each value to ensure accuracy:\n\n1. **Accounts Receivable (Balance Sheet)**:\n   - Line: \"Accounts Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 3558301.64 | 2024-01-29\"\n   - Correct: `3558301.64`\n\n2. **Financial Expenses (Income Statement)**:\n   - Line: \"Financial Expenses | 410850.65 | 2024-01-29\"\n   - Correct: `410850.65`\n\n3. **Purchase of Fixed Assets (Cash Flow Statement)**:\n   - Line: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets | 2265288.42 | 2024-01-29\"\n   - Correct: `2265288.42`\n\nAll values check out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3558301.64', 'value2': '410850.65', 'value3': '2265288.42'}}\n```",
