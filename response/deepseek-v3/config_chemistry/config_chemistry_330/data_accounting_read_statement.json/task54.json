Selling expenses generally include costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods and services, such as marketing, sales commissions, and distribution costs.\n\nLooking at the income statement in the problem to solve, we find the following line:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Selling Expenses | 395393.99 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nTherefore, the value we are looking for is '395393.99'.\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '395393.99'}}\n```",
