This line item is typically labeled as \"Gross Profit,\" which is calculated as Total Revenue minus Cost of Goods Sold (or Total Cost).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Identify Total Revenue**: In the given problem, the \"Total Revenue\" is listed as 7,099,920.95.\n2. **Identify Total Cost**: The \"Total Cost\" (or \"Cost of Goods Sold\") is listed as 5,540,000.00.\n3. **Calculate Gross Profit**: The difference between Total Revenue and Total Cost is the Gross Profit. \n   - Calculation: 7,099,920.95 (Total Revenue) - 5,540,000.00 (Total Cost) = 1,559,920.95.\n4. **Verify Gross Profit in the Statement**: The income statement already includes a line item for \"Gross Profit\" with the value 1,559,920.95, which matches our calculation.\n\n### Solution:\nThe value of the difference between revenue and cost (Gross Profit) is 1,559,920.95.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1559920.95'}}\n```",
