                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to identify the four specific line items from the income statement based on the descriptions provided in the task. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Task\nWe need to extract four specific values from the income statement:\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers**: This typically refers to \"Selling Expenses\" because these are costs related to marketing, selling, and distributing products.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is usually labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" in the income statement, which includes interest expenses and other costs related to financing.\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is straightforwardly \"Depreciation,\" which is the allocation of the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives.\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is the \"Tax Expense,\" representing the income tax owed for the period.\n\n### Identifying the Line Items\nNow, let's look at the provided income statement and find these line items:\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: Found as \"Selling Expenses\" with an amount of `395393.99`.\n2. **Depreciation**: Found as \"Depreciation\" with an amount of `45765.70`.\n3. **Financial Expenses**: Found as \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of `410850.65`.\n4. **Tax Expense**: Found as \"Tax Expense\" with an amount of `354996.05`.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking at the example provided:\n- 'value1' was \"Selling Expenses\" (`493854.67`).\n- 'value2' was \"Depreciation\" (`45751.41`).\n- 'value3' was \"Financial Expenses\" (`432511.69`).\n- 'value4' was \"Tax Expense\" (`271550.92`).\n\nThis confirms that the order is:\n1. Selling Expenses\n2. Depreciation\n3. Financial Expenses\n4. Tax Expense\n\n### Final Answer\nPlugging in the values from the problem statement:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '395393.99', 'value2': '45765.70', 'value3': '410850.65', 'value4': '354996.05'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n1. **Selling Expenses**: Identified as costs to secure orders and deliver goods/services → `395393.99`.\n2. **Depreciation**: Systematic allocation of asset cost → `45765.70`.\n3. **Financial Expenses**: Costs to raise funds → `410850.65`.\n4. **Tax Expense**: Total taxes for the period → `354996.05`.\n\nThis matches the order and definitions from the example, ensuring correctness.",
