                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand what we need to extract from the given financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to identify and extract three specific line items from the financial statements:\n\n1. **Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is typically the \"Profit Before Tax\" line in the Income Statement.\n2. **The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to the increase in \"Accounts Payable\" from the Balance Sheet or the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" from the Cash Flow Statement.\n3. **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is the \"Paid-in Capital\" from the Balance Sheet.\n\nThe outputs should be grouped by financial statement in the order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement. Within each group, we maintain the original line item order as shown in the input.\n\nGiven the example, the order is:\n1. Balance Sheet: Paid-in Capital\n2. Income Statement: Profit Before Tax\n3. Cash Flow Statement: Increase in Accounts Payable\n\n### Analyzing the Given Problem\n\nLet's go through each financial statement in the problem to find these items.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we have:\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Paid-in Capital | 13000000.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13000000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n- **Paid-in Capital**: The end amount is `13000000.00`. This hasn't changed from the initial amount, but since it's the capital contributed by shareholders, this is our first value.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n| Profit Before Tax | -820066.14 | 2024-01-29 |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\n- **Profit Before Tax**: `-820066.14`. This is our second value.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable | 2700000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\n- **Increase in Accounts Payable**: `2700000.00`. This is our third value.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\n\nLooking at the example provided:\n\n- 'value1': '13000000.00' (Paid-in Capital from Balance Sheet)\n- 'value2': '-1373590.51' (Profit Before Tax from Income Statement)\n- 'value3': '1590000.00' (Increase in Accounts Payable from Cash Flow Statement)\n\nThis matches our understanding of the order and the items to extract.\n\n### Finalizing the Answer\n\nBased on the above, the values are:\n\n1. Paid-in Capital: `13000000.00`\n2. Profit Before Tax: `-820066.14`\n3. Increase in Accounts Payable: `2700000.00`\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-820066.14', 'value3': '2700000.00'}}\n```",
