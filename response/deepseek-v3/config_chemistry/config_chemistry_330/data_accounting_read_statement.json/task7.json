Common expense items include depreciation, interest expense, etc. \n\n2. **Analyze the Balance Sheet**: \n   - The balance sheet provided includes items like \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which is related to depreciation expense. \n   - Depreciation expense is a common expense item that affects both the balance sheet (through accumulated depreciation) and the profit or loss statement.\n\n3. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is listed under non-current assets. \n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `0.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is `45765.70` as of `2024-01-29`.\n\n4. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The initial value of the expense (depreciation) is `0.00`.\n   - The end value of the expense (depreciation) is `45765.70`.\n\n5. **Verify**:\n   - The example provided in the task also used \"Accumulated Depreciation\" as the expense item, confirming that this is the correct line item to extract.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45765.70'} }\n```",
