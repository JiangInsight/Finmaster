The key line item to look for is \"Bank Deposits,\" which represents the funds deposited into a bank. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant line item**: In the balance sheet, the line item \"Bank Deposits\" is the one that represents the funds deposited into a bank.\n2. **Extract the initial value**: The initial amount for \"Bank Deposits\" is listed under the \"Initial_amount\" column, which is \"5000000.00\" as of the \"Initial_date\" \"2023-12-31\".\n3. **Extract the end value**: The end amount for \"Bank Deposits\" is listed under the \"End_amount\" column, which is \"194711.58\" as of the \"End_date\" \"2024-01-29\".\n\nThus, the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '194711.58'} }\n```",
