                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each financial statement one by one to find the three specific line items we need: \n\n1. **Amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid** (This should be in the Balance Sheet under \"Taxes Payable\").\n2. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities** (This should be in the Income Statement, likely under \"Total Revenue\" or \"Main Business Revenue\").\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities** (This should be in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\").\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we're interested in \"Taxes Payable\" because that represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid. \n\n- **Taxes Payable**: The \"End_amount\" is `354996.05`. \n\nSo, `value1 = '354996.05'`.\n\n### 2. Income Statement\nNow, let's look at the Income Statement for \"Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities\". \n\nThis is typically the revenue from the main business operations. In the Income Statement, we see:\n\n- **Main Business Revenue**: `7099920.95`\n- **Total Revenue**: `7099920.95` (same as Main Business Revenue in this case)\n\nSince \"Main Business Revenue\" is the principal revenue, we'll take that. \n\nSo, `value2 = '7099920.95'`.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nFinally, in the Cash Flow Statement, we need the \"Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities\". \n\nThis is clearly labeled as \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\", which is `-5394333.52`.\n\nSo, `value3 = '-5394333.52'`.\n\n### Verifying the Order\nThe order specified is:\n1. Balance Sheet (Taxes Payable)\n2. Income Statement (Main Business Revenue)\n3. Cash Flow Statement (Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities)\n\nThis matches how we've assigned the values.\n\n### Final Answer\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '354996.05', 'value2': '7099920.95', 'value3': '-5394333.52'}}\n```",
