I'm going to break it down to understand what's being asked and how to find the required information.\n\n### Understanding the Task\n\nWe need to extract two specific pieces of information from the given financial statements:\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This is typically found as \"Interest Receivable\" in the balance sheet. It represents interest income that has been earned but not yet received in cash.\n\n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is usually found in the cash flow statement under \"Net Increase\" or similar terminology related to the change in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThe financial statements are provided in three parts: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement. We need to look through these in the given order to find the required line items.\n\n### Given Financial Statements\n\nLet's go through each statement to locate the required information.\n\n#### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we're interested in \"Interest Receivable\". Here's the relevant line:\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Interest Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 1731.44 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nSo, the \"Interest accrued but not yet received\" is the \"End_amount\" for \"Interest Receivable\", which is **1731.44**.\n\n#### 2. Income Statement\n\nThe task mentions to look for two specific line items, but the first one (\"Interest accrued but not yet received\") is already found in the Balance Sheet. The second item is related to cash and cash equivalents, which is typically in the Cash Flow Statement. \n\nHowever, the Income Statement does have \"Interest Income\", but that's not what we're looking for here. So, we can skip this for our current task.\n\n#### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nNow, let's look at the Cash Flow Statement for the \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\". \n\nHere's the relevant part:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Ending Balance  | 340378.06 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Increase  | -7659621.94 | 2024-01-29 |\n\nThe \"Net Increase\" shows the net change in cash and cash equivalents during the period, which is **-7659621.94**.\n\n### Verifying the Line Items\n\nJust to ensure we're correct:\n\n- **Interest Receivable (Balance Sheet)**: This is indeed the interest that has been earned but not yet received, matching our first requirement.\n  \n- **Net Increase (Cash Flow Statement)**: This represents the net change in cash and cash equivalents over the period, which is our second requirement.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling the two values:\n\n1. Interest accrued but not yet received (Interest Receivable): 1731.44\n2. Net addition in cash and cash equivalents (Net Increase): -7659621.94\n\nSo, the solution in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1731.44', 'value2': '-7659621.94'} }\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary\n\n1. **Identify Interest Receivable in Balance Sheet**:\n   - Located \"Interest Receivable\" with an End_amount of 1731.44.\n\n2. **Identify Net Increase in Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - Located \"Net Increase\" under Cash and Cash Equivalents with a value of -7659621.94.\n\n3. **Compile the Values**:\n   - value1: '1731.44'\n   - value2: '-7659621.94'\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1731.44', 'value2': '-7659621.94'}}\n```",
