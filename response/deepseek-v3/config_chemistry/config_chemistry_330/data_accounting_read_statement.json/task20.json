COGS represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company, including the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the goods.\n   \n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given income statement, we look for the line item labeled \"Cost of Goods Sold.\" This is the line that directly corresponds to the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: From the table, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item has an amount of `5540000.00`.\n\n4. **Verify**: To ensure this is correct, we can cross-check with the example provided. In the example, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" was the correct line item, and its value was extracted as the solution.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5540000.00'} }\n```",
