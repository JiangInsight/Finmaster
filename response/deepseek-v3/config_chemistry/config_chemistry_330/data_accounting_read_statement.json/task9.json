This typically refers to the \"Taxes Payable\" line item, which represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet. This line item represents taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Value**:\n   - The initial value is the amount under the \"Initial_amount\" column for the \"Taxes Payable\" line item.\n   - From the given balance sheet: \"Taxes Payable\" has an \"Initial_amount\" of \"0.00\".\n\n3. **Extract End Value**:\n   - The end value is the amount under the \"End_amount\" column for the \"Taxes Payable\" line item.\n   - From the given balance sheet: \"Taxes Payable\" has an \"End_amount\" of \"354996.05\".\n\n4. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - The solution should include the initial and end values for the \"Taxes Payable\" line item.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '354996.05'} }\n```",
