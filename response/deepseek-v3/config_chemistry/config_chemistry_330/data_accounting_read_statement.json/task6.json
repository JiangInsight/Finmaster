These items are typically classified as \"Fixed Assets\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Tangible Items for Production/Use/Rental/Administrative Purposes**:\n   - Tangible items used in production or supply of goods/services, for rental, or for administrative purposes are usually listed under \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet. This is because fixed assets include property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) which are tangible and used in operations.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Line Items**:\n   - In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Fixed Assets\" represents the tangible items held for use in production or supply of goods/services, rental, or administrative purposes.\n   - The \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item is related to fixed assets but represents the depreciation over time, not the tangible value itself. The net value after depreciation is reflected in \"Total Non-current Assets,\" but we are interested in the gross value of the fixed assets.\n\n3. **Extract Initial and Final Values**:\n   - The initial value of fixed assets is given as \"5000000.00\" as of the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n   - The end value of fixed assets is given as \"7265288.42\" as of the end date \"2024-01-29\".\n\n4. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value of fixed assets is consistent with the example provided in the task description.\n   - The end value of fixed assets is the gross value before accounting for accumulated depreciation, which is appropriate for this task.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '7265288.42'} }\n```",
