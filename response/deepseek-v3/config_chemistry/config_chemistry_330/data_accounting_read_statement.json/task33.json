In the given problem, this is clearly labeled as \"Main Business Revenue\" with an amount of \"7099920.95\".\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. In the given problem, this is labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with an amount of \"5540000.00\".\n\nThese two line items are the first two relevant items in the income statement, and they appear in the original order as required. \n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7099920.95', 'value2': '5540000.00'} }\n```",
