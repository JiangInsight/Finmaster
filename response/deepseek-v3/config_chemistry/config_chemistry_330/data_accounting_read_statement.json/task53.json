The COGS represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate the Income Statement**: The Income Statement provides details about revenues and expenses, including the Cost of Goods Sold.\n2. **Identify the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This line item directly represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n3. **Extract the Value**: In the given Income Statement, the value for \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is `5540000.00`.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5540000.00'} }\n```",
