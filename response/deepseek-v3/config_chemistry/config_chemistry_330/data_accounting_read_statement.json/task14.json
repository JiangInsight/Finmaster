These are typically classified as \"Current Liabilities\" on the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Liabilities**: \n   - Current liabilities are obligations that are expected to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually within one year). \n   - In the given balance sheet, the line items under \"Current Liabilities\" are:\n     - Accounts Payable\n     - Taxes Payable\n     - Total Current Liabilities\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Total Current Liabilities\" line item provides the aggregate value of all current liabilities at the initial and end dates.\n   - From the table:\n     - **Initial_amount** for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `0.00` (as of `2023-12-31`).\n     - **End_amount** for \"Total Current Liabilities\" is `3054996.05` (as of `2024-01-29`).\n\n3. **Verify Line Items**:\n   - The individual current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable) sum up to the \"Total Current Liabilities\":\n     - Accounts Payable: `2700000.00`\n     - Taxes Payable: `354996.05`\n     - Total: `2700000.00 + 354996.05 = 3054996.05` (matches the \"Total Current Liabilities\" value).\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3054996.05'} }\n```",
