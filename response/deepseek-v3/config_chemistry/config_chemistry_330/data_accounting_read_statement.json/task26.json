In an income statement, these are often listed under \"Financial Expenses\" or similar terms.\n2. **Reviewing the Income Statement**: Looking at the provided income statement, we can see a line item labeled \"Financial Expenses\" with an amount of \"410850.65\" dated \"2024-01-29\".\n3. **Verification**: This line item is the most relevant as it directly pertains to the costs incurred by the enterprise for raising funds. Other expenses like administrative or selling expenses are not related to financing costs.\n4. **Extraction**: The value to be extracted is \"410850.65\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '410850.65'}}\n```",
