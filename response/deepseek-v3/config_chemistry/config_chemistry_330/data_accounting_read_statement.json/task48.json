In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Net Profit.\"\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. In the cash flow statement, this is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Net Profit**:\n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Net Profit\" in the cash flow statement.\n   - In the given problem, the \"Net Profit\" line item has an amount of `-1175062.19`.\n\n2. **Identify Purchase of Fixed Assets**:\n   - Look for the line item labeled \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement.\n   - In the given problem, the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item has an amount of `2265288.42`.\n\n3. **Extract the Values**:\n   - The first value (`value1`) corresponds to \"Net Profit,\" which is `-1175062.19`.\n   - The second value (`value2`) corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is `2265288.42`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-1175062.19', 'value2': '2265288.42'}}\n```",
