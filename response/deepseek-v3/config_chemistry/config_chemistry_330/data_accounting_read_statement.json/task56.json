This refers to the depreciation expense recorded in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Depreciation in the Income Statement**:\n   - In the income statement, there is a line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with an amount of \"45765.70\" for the date \"2024-01-29\".\n\n2. **Verify Depreciation in the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\", there is a line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with the same amount of \"45765.70\" for the date \"2024-01-29\". This confirms the depreciation expense.\n\n3. **Check Accumulated Depreciation in the Balance Sheet**:\n   - The balance sheet shows \"Accumulated Depreciation\" under \"Fixed Assets\" with an \"End_amount\" of \"45765.70\" for the date \"2024-01-29\". This matches the depreciation expense, indicating the systematic allocation over the period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The depreciation expense for the period is consistently reported as \"45765.70\" across all relevant financial statements.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45765.70'}}\n```",
