This is typically reflected in the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item in the cash flow statement under the \"Operating Activities\" section.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Understand the Task**: The task asks for the value of the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit. This is directly related to the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item in the cash flow statement. A decrease in accounts receivable means that the entity has collected more cash from its customers than the credit sales made during the period, which is a positive cash flow. However, in the cash flow statement, an increase in accounts receivable is typically shown as a negative value (since it represents cash not yet received), and a decrease is shown as a positive value (since it represents cash received).\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: In the given problem, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present with a value of \"-3558301.64\". The negative sign indicates an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., amounts owed to the entity have increased, which is a use of cash). However, the task asks for the \"decrease\" in amounts owed. Since the value is negative, it actually represents an increase, not a decrease. \n\n   - If the task is interpreted as asking for the value of the line item that represents changes in amounts owed (regardless of increase or decrease), then the value is \"-3558301.64\". \n   - If the task is strictly asking for a decrease (positive value), there is no such value in the given data (since the value is negative). \n\n   Given the example provided in the task description, the solution extracted the value of \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" even though it was negative (indicating an increase). Thus, the task likely expects the raw value of the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item, regardless of whether it represents an increase or decrease.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value for \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is \"-3558301.64\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3558301.64'}}\n```",
