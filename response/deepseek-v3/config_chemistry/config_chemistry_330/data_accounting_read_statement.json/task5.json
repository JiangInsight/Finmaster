These assets are typically categorized under \"Inventory\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - From the given balance sheet, the line item that represents assets held for sale or in production is \"Inventory\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Amount**: The initial value of Inventory is listed as \"0.00\" on the initial date \"2023-12-31\".\n   - **End Amount**: The end value of Inventory is listed as \"3760000.00\" on the end date \"2024-01-29\".\n\n3. **Verify the Context**:\n   - The \"Inventory\" line item fits the description of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, as it represents goods that are either finished and ready for sale, in the process of being manufactured, or in production for sale.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3760000.00'} }\n```",
