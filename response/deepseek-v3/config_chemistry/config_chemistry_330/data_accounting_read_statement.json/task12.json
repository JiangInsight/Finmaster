These are typically referred to as \"Current Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within one year or the normal operating cycle of the business. In the given balance sheet, the line item \"Total Current Assets\" represents the sum of all such assets.\n\n2. **Locate Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is the value at the beginning of the period (initial value).\n   - The \"End_amount\" for \"Total Current Assets\" is the value at the end of the period (end value).\n\n3. **Extract Values**:\n   - From the problem, the \"Total Current Assets\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 8000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End_amount: 7660411.14 (as of 2024-01-29)\n\n4. **Verify**: \n   - The initial value is consistent with the sum of individual current assets (Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, etc.) at the start.\n   - The end value is consistent with the sum of individual current assets at the end.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7660411.14'}}\n```",
