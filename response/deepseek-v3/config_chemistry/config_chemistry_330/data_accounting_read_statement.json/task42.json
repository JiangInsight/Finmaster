This is typically found under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section of the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Section**: In the provided cash flow statement, the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section contains the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which represents cash payments for acquiring PP&E and other long-term assets.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The value associated with \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is the amount we need. In the given problem, this value is \"2265288.42\".\n\n4. **Verify the Context**: The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is negative (\"-2265288.42\"), which aligns with the outflow of cash for purchasing fixed assets. This confirms that \"2265288.42\" is the correct value to extract.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2265288.42'}}\n```",
