In the given problem, these are the first two line items under the \"Account\" column.\n2. **Tangible items that are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes**: This refers to \"Fixed Assets\" in the balance sheet.\n3. **The amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid**: This is represented by \"Taxes Payable\" in the balance sheet.\n\nWe will extract the initial and end amounts for these three line items in the order they appear in the balance sheet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Cash on Hand**:\n   - Initial amount: 3000000.00\n   - End amount: 145666.48\n\n2. **Bank Deposits**:\n   - Initial amount: 5000000.00\n   - End amount: 194711.58\n\n3. **Fixed Assets**:\n   - Initial amount: 5000000.00\n   - End amount: 7265288.42\n\n4. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - Initial amount: 0.00\n   - End amount: 354996.05\n\nHowever, the task specifies to extract only three line items. Based on the example provided, the three line items are:\n- Cash on Hand (representing cash available for day-to-day operations)\n- Fixed Assets (representing tangible items)\n- Taxes Payable (representing tax accrued but not yet paid)\n\nThus, we will ignore \"Bank Deposits\" and proceed with the three specified items.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '3000000.00', 'end valu1': '145666.48', 'initial value2': '5000000.00', 'end valu2': '7265288.42', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '354996.05'}}\n```",
