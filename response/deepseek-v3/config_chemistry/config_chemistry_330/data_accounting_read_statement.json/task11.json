This is typically found under \"Retained Earnings\" in the balance sheet. \n\nFrom the provided balance sheet, we can see the following entries for \"Retained Earnings\":\n- Initial_amount: 0.00 (Initial_date: 2023-12-31)\n- End_amount: -1175062.19 (End_date: 2024-01-29)\n\nThese values indicate the initial and final amounts of retained earnings, which represent the cumulative profits or losses retained in the entity.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '-1175062.19'} }\n```",
