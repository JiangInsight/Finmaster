This typically refers to the \"Accounts Payable\" line item in the financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   - The amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit is recorded under \"Accounts Payable\" in the balance sheet and \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" in the cash flow statement.\n\n2. **Check the Balance Sheet**:\n   - In the balance sheet provided, the \"Accounts Payable\" line shows:\n     - Initial_amount: 0.00\n     - End_amount: 2700000.00\n   - This indicates an increase of 2,700,000.00 in accounts payable during the period.\n\n3. **Verify with the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" shows:\n     - Amount: 2700000.00\n   - This confirms the increase in accounts payable during the period.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 2,700,000.00.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2700000.00'}}\n```",
