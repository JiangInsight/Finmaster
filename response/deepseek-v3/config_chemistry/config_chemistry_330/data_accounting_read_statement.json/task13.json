These are typically non-current assets, which include items like fixed assets, long-term investments, and intangible assets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Current Assets**: \n   - Non-current assets are assets that are not expected to be converted into cash or used up within the normal operating cycle of the business (usually one year). In the given balance sheet, the non-current assets are represented by \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Total Non-current Assets\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - The \"Fixed Assets\" line shows an initial value of `5000000.00` and an end value of `7265288.42`. However, this is before accounting for accumulated depreciation.\n   - The \"Total Non-current Assets\" line shows the net value after accounting for accumulated depreciation. The initial value is `5000000.00` and the end value is `7219522.72`. This is the correct value to use because it reflects the net book value of non-current assets.\n\n3. **Verify the Values**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is `5000000.00` (as of 2023-12-31).\n   - The end value of non-current assets is `7219522.72` (as of 2024-01-29), which is calculated as `Fixed Assets (7265288.42)` minus `Accumulated Depreciation (45765.70)`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The values to be extracted are the initial and end values of \"Total Non-current Assets\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '7219522.72'} }\n```",
