                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate three ratios based on the provided financial statements: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio.\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities here):** 3,054,996.05\n- **Total Owner's Equity:** 11,824,937.81\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,054,996.05}{11,824,937.81} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,054,996.05}{11,824,937.81} \\approx 0.258 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 0.26\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Net Profit:** -1,175,062.19\n- **Total Revenue:** 7,099,920.95\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,175,062.19}{7,099,920.95} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,175,062.19}{7,099,920.95} \\approx -0.1655 \\]\n\nMultiply by 100:\n\n\\[ -0.1655 \\times 100 \\approx -16.55\\% \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -5,394,333.52\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 3,054,996.05\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{-5,394,333.52}{3,054,996.05} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-5,394,333.52}{3,054,996.05} \\approx -1.766 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -1.77\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow, compiling all these calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.26', 'Net Profit Margin': '-16.55%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   - Liabilities: 3,054,996.05\n   - Equity: 11,824,937.81\n   - 3,054,996.05 / 11,824,937.81 ≈ 0.258 → 0.26 ✔\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin:**\n   - Net Profit: -1,175,062.19\n   - Revenue: 7,099,920.95\n   - (-1,175,062.19 / 7,099,920.95) * 100 ≈ -16.55% ✔\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio:**\n   - Operating Cash Flow: -5,394,333.52\n   - Current Liabilities: 3,054,996.05\n   - -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ -1.766 → -1.77 ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The calculations seem correct based on the provided data.",
