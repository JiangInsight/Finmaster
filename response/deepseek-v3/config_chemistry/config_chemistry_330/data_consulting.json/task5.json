                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Gross Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Gross Profit Margin is. From what I recall, the Gross Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce its goods or services.\n\nThe formula for Gross Profit Margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- **Gross Profit** = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n- **Total Revenue** is the total income from sales before any expenses are deducted.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 7,099,920.95\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 5,540,000.00\n- **Gross Profit**: 1,559,920.95 (This is already given, but just to confirm, it's Total Revenue - COGS = 7,099,920.95 - 5,540,000.00 = 1,559,920.95)\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,559,920.95}{7,099,920.95} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide Gross Profit by Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,559,920.95}{7,099,920.95} \\approx 0.2197 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ 0.2197 \\times 100 \\approx 21.97\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nLet me double-check the calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. Divide 1,559,920.95 by 7,099,920.95:\n   - 1,559,920.95 ÷ 7,099,920.95 ≈ 0.2197\n\n2. Multiply by 100:\n   - 0.2197 × 100 = 21.97%\n\nThis seems correct.\n\n### Comparing with the Example\n\nLooking back at the example provided:\n\n- Gross Profit: 1,021,018.59\n- Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Gross Profit Margin: 18.80%\n\nCalculating it:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,021,018.59}{5,431,018.59} \\approx 0.188 \\]\n\\[ 0.188 \\times 100 \\approx 18.80\\% \\]\n\nThis matches the given solution, so my method seems correct.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nApplying the same method to the problem at hand:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,559,920.95}{7,099,920.95} \\approx 0.2197 \\]\n\\[ 0.2197 \\times 100 \\approx 21.97\\% \\]\n\n### Rounding Considerations\n\nThe example had the Gross Profit Margin rounded to two decimal places (18.80%). Following the same convention, 21.97% is already to two decimal places, so no further rounding is needed.\n\n### Potential Missteps\n\nInitially, one might confuse Gross Profit with Net Profit or include other expenses in the calculation, but Gross Profit Margin specifically uses Gross Profit and Total Revenue, excluding other operating expenses, taxes, etc.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully going through the calculations and verifying each step, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately 21.97%.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '21.97%'}}\n```",
