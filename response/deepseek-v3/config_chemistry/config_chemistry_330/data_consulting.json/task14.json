Here, it is **7,099,920.95**.\n\n2. **Calculate Average Accounts Receivable**:\n   - **Beginning Accounts Receivable**: From the balance sheet's initial amount, it is **0.00** (since the initial amount is 0.00).\n   - **Ending Accounts Receivable**: From the balance sheet's end amount, it is **3,558,301.64**.\n   - **Average Accounts Receivable** = (Beginning AR + Ending AR) / 2 = (0.00 + 3,558,301.64) / 2 = **1,779,150.82**.\n\n3. **Compute the Ratio**:\n   - Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable\n   - Ratio = 7,099,920.95 / 1,779,150.82 ≈ **3.99**.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   ```json\n   {\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.99'}}\n   ```",
