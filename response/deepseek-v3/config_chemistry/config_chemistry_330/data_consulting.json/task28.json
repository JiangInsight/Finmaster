                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio, the Gross Profit Margin, and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. I'll go through each one, explaining how to find them using the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities (End_amount):** 3,054,996.05\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n- **Total Assets (End_amount):** 14,879,933.86\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,054,996.05}{14,879,933.86} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,054,996.05}{14,879,933.86} \\approx 0.2053 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.205 or 20.5%. But looking at the example, it's presented as a decimal, not a percentage, so we'll keep it as 0.21 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nWait, the example had '0.14', which is to two decimal places, so maybe we should keep it to two decimal places here as well: 0.21.\n\nBut let's check if there are any other liabilities. The balance sheet only shows \"Total Current Liabilities\" under liabilities, and nothing else, so it seems correct.\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit:** 1,559,920.95\n- **Total Revenue:** 7,099,920.95\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,559,920.95}{7,099,920.95} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nCalculating the division first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1,559,920.95}{7,099,920.95} \\approx 0.2197 \\]\n\nThen multiply by 100%:\n\n\\[ 0.2197 \\times 100\\% \\approx 21.97\\% \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 21.97%\n\nThe example had '18.80%', so similar format.\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow from operations. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** -5,394,333.52\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Liabilities:** 3,054,996.05\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-5,394,333.52}{3,054,996.05} \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-5,394,333.52}{3,054,996.05} \\approx -1.766 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: -1.77\n\nThe example had '-3.90', so similar format.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all three calculated ratios:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.21', 'Gross Profit Margin': '21.97%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77'}}\n```\n\nHowever, let's double-check the Debt to Asset Ratio calculation to ensure we didn't miss any liabilities.\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet:\n- Under liabilities, only \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\" are listed, summing to \"Total Current Liabilities.\"\n- There's no mention of long-term debt or other non-current liabilities.\n- So, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05.\n\nThus, the calculation seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for Gross Profit Margin, the numbers are directly from the income statement, and the calculation is straightforward.\n\nFor Operating Cash Flow Ratio, the numbers are correctly taken from the cash flow statement and balance sheet.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is accurate as calculated.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.21', 'Gross Profit Margin': '21.97%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77'}}\n```",
