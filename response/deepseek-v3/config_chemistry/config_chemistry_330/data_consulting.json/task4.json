                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio based on the given balance sheet. \n\n### Understanding the Debt to Equity Ratio\nFirst, what is the Debt to Equity Ratio? It's a financial metric that compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Shareholders' Equity}} \\]\n\nThis ratio tells us how much debt a company is using to finance its assets relative to the value of shareholders' equity.\n\n### Identifying the Components from the Balance Sheet\nFrom the given balance sheet, we need to identify:\n1. **Total Liabilities**: This is the sum of all the company's debts or obligations.\n2. **Total Shareholders' Equity**: This is the owners' claim after all liabilities have been paid off.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n\n#### Total Liabilities\nUnder the \"Account\" column, we see:\n- Accounts Payable: 2,700,000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 354,996.05\n- Total Current Liabilities: 3,054,996.05\n\nAre there any non-current liabilities? The table doesn't list any (like long-term debt), so we'll assume that \"Total Current Liabilities\" is the same as \"Total Liabilities\" in this case.\n\nSo, **Total Liabilities = 3,054,996.05**\n\n#### Total Shareholders' Equity\nUnder the \"Account\" column, we see:\n- Paid-in Capital: 13,000,000.00\n- Retained Earnings: -1,175,062.19\n- Total Owner's Equity: 11,824,937.81\n\nSo, **Total Shareholders' Equity = 11,824,937.81**\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\nNow, plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,054,996.05}{11,824,937.81} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,054,996.05}{11,824,937.81} \\approx 0.258 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, it's approximately 0.26.\n\n### Verifying with the Example\nLooking back at the example provided:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Total Owner's Equity: 11,354,858.57\n- Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 11,354,858.57 â‰ˆ 0.16\n\nThis matches the given solution, so our method seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nFor the given problem:\n- Total Liabilities: 3,054,996.05\n- Total Shareholders' Equity: 11,824,937.81\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.26\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.26'} }\n```",
