                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate two key ratios: the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio. \n\n### 1. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** Gross Profit Margin is a measure of a company's profitability, calculated as Gross Profit divided by Total Revenue, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 1,559,920.95\n- Total Revenue = 7,099,920.95\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{1,559,920.95}{7,099,920.95} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's do the math:\n\\[ \\frac{1,559,920.95}{7,099,920.95} \\approx 0.2197 \\]\n\\[ 0.2197 \\times 100 \\approx 21.97\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **21.97%**.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio measures a company's ability to cover its total debt with its operating cash flow. It's calculated as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by Total Debt (here, we'll use Total Current Liabilities as a proxy for debt since the balance sheet doesn't list long-term debt separately).\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,394,333.52\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-5,394,333.52}{3,054,996.05} \\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\\[ \\frac{-5,394,333.52}{3,054,996.05} \\approx -1.765 \\]\n\nSo, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately **-1.77**.\n\n### Verifying the Approach\n\nWait a minute, in the example provided, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio was calculated using Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by Total Current Liabilities, resulting in a negative value. That seems correct here as well since our operating cash flow is negative.\n\nHowever, sometimes \"debt\" might refer to total liabilities, but in this case, the balance sheet doesn't show any long-term liabilities, only current liabilities. So, using Total Current Liabilities seems appropriate.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter calculating both ratios:\n\n- Gross Profit Margin: 21.97%\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -1.77\n\nExpressed in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '21.97%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77'}}\n```",
