                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Net Profit Margin based on the given income statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst, I need to understand what Net Profit Margin is. From what I recall, Net Profit Margin is a financial metric that shows the percentage of revenue that remains as net profit after all expenses, taxes, and other costs are deducted. \n\nThe formula for Net Profit Margin is:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nThis will give us a percentage that tells us how much of each dollar earned by the company is actual profit.\n\n### Identifying the Given Values\nFrom the provided income statement, I can see the following relevant figures:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 7,099,920.95\n- **Net Profit**: -1,175,062.19\n\n(Note: The negative sign indicates a loss rather than a profit.)\n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\nNow, let's plug these numbers into the formula.\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,175,062.19}{7,099,920.95} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide the Net Profit by the Total Revenue:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1,175,062.19}{7,099,920.95} \\approx -0.1655 \\]\n\nThen, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\n\\[ -0.1655 \\times 100 = -16.55\\% \\]\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\nLet me double-check the division to ensure accuracy.\n\nCalculating \\( \\frac{1,175,062.19}{7,099,920.95} \\):\n\n- 7,099,920.95 divided into 1,175,062.19: \n  - 7,099,920.95 × 0.1 = 709,992.095\n  - Subtract from 1,175,062.19: 1,175,062.19 - 709,992.095 = 465,070.095\n  - Next, 7,099,920.95 × 0.06 = 425,995.257\n  - Subtract: 465,070.095 - 425,995.257 = 39,074.838\n  - Next, 7,099,920.95 × 0.005 = 35,499.60475\n  - Subtract: 39,074.838 - 35,499.60475 ≈ 3,575.23325\n  - Adding up the multipliers: 0.1 + 0.06 + 0.005 = 0.165\n  - The remainder is small, so the division is approximately 0.1655.\n\nSo, the division seems correct, leading to -16.55%.\n\n### Considering the Example\nLooking back at the provided example:\n\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Total Revenue: 5,431,018.59\n- Calculation: (-1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59) × 100 ≈ -30.29%\n\nThis matches the given solution, confirming that the method is correct.\n\n### Final Calculation for the Given Problem\nApplying the same method:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,175,062.19}{7,099,920.95} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx -16.55\\% \\]\n\n### Formatting the Answer\nThe solution should be presented in the specified JSON format with the Net Profit Margin rounded to two decimal places as a percentage.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '-16.55%'} }\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully performing the calculations and verifying each step, the Net Profit Margin for the given income statement is **-16.55%**. This means that for every dollar of revenue, the company is losing approximately 16.55 cents.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Profit Margin': '-16.55%'} }\n```",
