                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**: This shows how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n   \\]\n   Since we only have the ending inventory (no beginning inventory other than zero), we'll use the ending inventory as the average inventory for this calculation.\n\n### Extracting the Necessary Data\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n\n- **Total Current Assets**: 7,660,411.14\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 3,054,996.05\n- **Inventory (Ending)**: 3,760,000.00\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 5,540,000.00\n\n### Calculating the Current Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{7,660,411.14}{3,054,996.05}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7,660,411.14}{3,054,996.05} \\approx 2.507\n\\]\n\nSo, the Current Ratio is approximately **2.51**.\n\nWait a minute, but in the example provided, the Current Ratio was given as '4.27'. Let me double-check if I'm looking at the right numbers.\n\nLooking back at the example:\n\n- Example's Total Current Assets: 7,956,806.47\n- Example's Total Current Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Calculation: 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 4.27\n\nOkay, that checks out. In our problem:\n\n- Total Current Assets: 7,660,411.14\n- Total Current Liabilities: 3,054,996.05\n- 7,660,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ 2.507\n\nSo, it seems correct. Maybe the example had higher current assets relative to liabilities compared to our problem.\n\n### Calculating the Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{5,540,000.00}{3,760,000.00}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5,540,000.00}{3,760,000.00} \\approx 1.473\n\\]\n\nSo, the Inventory Turnover Ratio is approximately **1.47**.\n\nAgain, checking the example:\n\n- Example's COGS: 4,410,000.00\n- Example's Inventory: 5,090,000.00 (assuming ending inventory as average)\n- 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.866, but the given answer is '1.73'. Hmm, this doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the average inventory is calculated differently. If beginning inventory was 0 and ending is 5,090,000, average is (0 + 5,090,000)/2 = 2,545,000.\n\nThen:\n\n4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nAh, that makes sense! So, for average inventory, we should take (beginning + ending) / 2.\n\nIn our problem:\n\n- Beginning Inventory: 0.00 (from initial amount)\n- Ending Inventory: 3,760,000.00\n- Average Inventory: (0 + 3,760,000) / 2 = 1,880,000\n\nNow, Inventory Turnover:\n\n5,540,000 / 1,880,000 ≈ 2.947\n\nWait, but the example had:\n\nBeginning: 0, Ending: 5,090,000 → Avg: 2,545,000\nCOGS: 4,410,000 → 4,410,000 / 2,545,000 ≈ 1.73\n\nSimilarly, in our case:\n\nBeginning: 0, Ending: 3,760,000 → Avg: 1,880,000\nCOGS: 5,540,000 → 5,540,000 / 1,880,000 ≈ 2.947\n\nBut this seems higher than expected. Maybe the initial inventory isn't zero? Wait, in the balance sheet, initial inventory is listed as 0.00, and end amount is 3,760,000.00.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inventory at the beginning of the period is not zero, but not provided. The \"Initial_amount\" for Inventory is 0.00, and \"End_amount\" is 3,760,000.00. Maybe the initial amount is not the beginning inventory for the period but some other initial value.\n\nLooking at the example, initial inventory was also 0.00, and end was 5,090,000.00, and they used average as (0 + end)/2 to get 1.73.\n\nSimilarly, we should do (0 + 3,760,000)/2 = 1,880,000, then 5,540,000 / 1,880,000 ≈ 2.947.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the example's approach unless the example had a different COGS or inventory.\n\nWait, in the example, COGS was 4,410,000, inventory avg 2,545,000 → 1.73.\n\nHere, COGS is higher (5,540,000), inventory avg lower (1,880,000), so ratio higher (2.947).\n\nMaybe the example had a typo, or perhaps the inventory turnover is calculated differently (like using ending inventory only).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the period is such that average is just ending inventory.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and following the example where initial was 0 and end was given, and they likely did (beginning + end)/2, we'll do the same.\n\nSo, Inventory Turnover Ratio ≈ 2.95.\n\nBut the example's calculation seems to have used (COGS / ending inventory), not average:\n\n4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.866, but given as 1.73, which is double, suggesting (COGS / (ending/2)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inventory at the beginning of the period is not the \"Initial_amount\" in the balance sheet, but the balance sheet shows changes over a period where initial is start of that period.\n\nGiven that, and since the example seems to use (COGS / ending inventory) * 2 to get 1.73 (since 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.866, *2 ≈1.73), maybe the ratio is annualized or something.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with standard accounting practices.\n\nGiven that, and to match the example's approach, perhaps the Inventory Turnover is simply COGS / Ending Inventory:\n\n5,540,000 / 3,760,000 ≈ 1.473\n\nBut the example gave 1.73 for 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.866, which doesn't match unless multiplied by 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inventory turnover is COGS / ((beginning + ending)/2), where beginning is not zero but not provided.\n\nGiven the confusion, and since the initial inventory is listed as 0.00, and end as 3,760,000, the most straightforward is to assume average is (0 + end)/2 = 1,880,000, then:\n\n5,540,000 / 1,880,000 ≈ 2.947\n\nBut this contradicts the example where similar numbers gave 1.73.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial inventory is not zero, but the \"Initial_amount\" is zero at some earlier date, and the beginning inventory for the period is not shown.\n\nGiven that, and lacking beginning inventory, the safest is to use ending inventory as the denominator, giving:\n\n5,540,000 / 3,760,000 ≈ 1.47\n\nBut the example's similar calculation gave higher, so maybe it's COGS / ((beginning + ending)/2), with beginning not zero.\n\nGiven that, and since we can't determine beginning inventory other than initial being zero, perhaps the ratio is not calculable accurately, but given the example, maybe it's intended to use ending inventory.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the standard method: average inventory is (beginning + ending)/2, with beginning as initial_amount = 0, so average = ending/2.\n\nThus:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / (ending inventory / 2) = 5,540,000 / 1,880,000 ≈ 2.947\n\nBut since the example with similar numbers gave 1.73, which is COGS / ending inventory * 2, maybe the intended calculation is COGS / ending inventory, then multiply by 2 for some reason.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial_amount is not the beginning inventory for the period, but the balance sheet shows changes over a different period.\n\nGiven that, and to match the example's approach, perhaps the ratio is simply COGS / ending inventory:\n\n5,540,000 / 3,760,000 ≈ 1.47\n\nBut the example's was 4,410,000 / 5,090,000 ≈ 0.866, given as 1.73, which is double, suggesting COGS / (ending / 2).\n\nGiven that, and since initial is zero, ending is given, average is ending / 2, so:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / (ending / 2) = (5,540,000 * 2) / 3,760,000 ≈ 2.947\n\nBut the example's was 4,410,000 * 2 / 5,090,000 ≈ 1.73, which matches their given answer.\n\nSo, applying same method:\n\n(5,540,000 * 2) / 3,760,000 ≈ 2.947\n\nBut this seems high compared to example's 1.73, but mathematically correct based on their method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial_amount is not zero for inventory, but the balance sheet shows initial as zero, end as 3,760,000, implying beginning is zero, so average is 1,880,000, then COGS / average = 2.947.\n\nGiven that, and since the example likely had beginning inventory not zero (but initial_amount zero), leading to their calculation, perhaps in our case, beginning is also not zero, but not provided.\n\nGiven that, the most accurate with given data is to assume initial is beginning, so average is ending / 2, then ratio is COGS / (ending / 2) = 2.947.\n\nBut to match the example's presentation, perhaps it's rounded to two decimal places: 2.95.\n\nBut the example's was 1.73, which is lower, suggesting maybe our COGS is higher relative to inventory.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with:\n\nCurrent Ratio: 2.51\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio: 2.95\n\nBut the example's ratios were given with two decimal places, so I'll do the same.\n\nHowever, looking back, the example's Current Ratio was 4.27 (from 7,956,806.47 / 1,861,550.92), and ours is 7,660,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ 2.507 → 2.51.\n\nInventory Turnover in example: 4,410,000 / (5,090,000 / 2) ≈ 1.73\n\nOurs: 5,540,000 / (3,760,000 / 2) ≈ 2.95\n\nBut perhaps the initial_amount is not the beginning inventory for the period, but the balance sheet shows initial and end amounts over some period, and the income statement is for a different period.\n\nGiven that, and lacking clarity, I'll stick with the calculations based on given data.\n\n### Final Calculations\n\n1. **Current Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7,660,411.14}{3,054,996.05} \\approx 2.507 \\approx 2.51\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**:\n   - Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\n   - Beginning Inventory (initial_amount) = 0.00\n   - Ending Inventory = 3,760,000.00\n   - Average Inventory = (0 + 3,760,000) / 2 = 1,880,000\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5,540,000}{1,880,000} \\approx 2.947 \\approx 2.95\n   \\]\n\nBut the example seems to have used COGS / Ending Inventory * 2, which is the same as COGS / (Ending / 2), so our calculation is correct based on that method.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.51',
