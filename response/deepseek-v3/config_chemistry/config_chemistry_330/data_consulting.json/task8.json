                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the given cash flow statement. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\" is. From what I know, this ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income reported by the company. It's a measure of how well a company's net income is being converted into actual cash flow from operations.\n\nThe formula for this ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit (Net Income)}} \\]\n\n### Identifying the Required Values\n\nFrom the given problem, I can see two key pieces of information:\n\n1. **Net Profit (Net Income):** This is given as -1,175,062.19.\n2. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** This is given as -5,394,333.52.\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nNow, let's plug these numbers into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-5,394,333.52}{-1,175,062.19} \\]\n\nDividing these two negative numbers will give a positive result because a negative divided by a negative is positive.\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,394,333.52}{1,175,062.19} \\approx 4.59 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 4.59.\n\n### Verifying the Calculation\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let's verify:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -5,394,333.52\n- Net Profit: -1,175,062.19\n\nDividing the absolute values:\n\n5,394,333.52 ÷ 1,175,062.19 ≈ 4.59\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\n### Considering the Example\n\nLooking back at the provided example:\n\n- Net Profit: -1,645,141.43\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\n- Ratio given: 4.41\n\nCalculating:\n\n7,259,994.10 ÷ 1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nThis matches the given solution, so my approach seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio for the given problem is approximately 4.59.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '4.59'}}\n```",
