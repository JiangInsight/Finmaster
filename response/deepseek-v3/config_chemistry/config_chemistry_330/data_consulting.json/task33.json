                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio one by one using the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,394,333.52\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts):\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Cash Flow Ratio = -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ -1.77\n\n### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt\n\nFirst, we need to determine Total Debt. From the balance sheet, the only liabilities listed are:\n- Accounts Payable = 2,700,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 354,996.05\nTotal Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05 (which seems to be the total debt as there are no long-term liabilities listed)\n\nOperating Cash Flow = -5,394,333.52\n\nCalculation:\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio = -5,394,333.52 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ -1.77\n\n*Note: This seems the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio because in this case, total debt is equal to current liabilities. Maybe there's a different interpretation, but based on the given data, this is the calculation.*\n\n### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:** Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Cost of Goods Sold = 5,540,000.00\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Initial Inventory = 0.00\n- Ending Inventory = 3,760,000.00\nAverage Inventory = (0 + 3,760,000) / 2 = 1,880,000.00\n\nCalculation:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 5,540,000.00 / 1,880,000.00 ≈ 2.95\n\n*Wait a minute, in the example provided, the Inventory Turnover Ratio was calculated using only the ending inventory, not the average. Maybe the company expects us to use ending inventory only. Let me check:*\n\nIf using Ending Inventory only:\nInventory Turnover Ratio = 5,540,000.00 / 3,760,000.00 ≈ 1.47\n\nGiven that the example used ending inventory (5090000 and COGS was 4410000, giving 4410000/5090000 ≈ 0.87, but their answer was 1.73, which is COGS / ending inventory * 2 maybe? Not sure. Maybe it's COGS / average inventory where initial is zero, so average is half ending, hence multiply by 2. So 4410000 / (5090000/2) = 4410000 / 2545000 ≈ 1.73. So in our case: 5540000 / (3760000/2) = 5540000 / 1880000 ≈ 2.95. But their example had 1.73, which is COGS / ending inventory * 2. Maybe it's annualized? Not sure. Given the ambiguity, I'll stick with COGS / average inventory = 2.95.*\n\nBut looking back, their COGS was 4410000, ending inventory 5090000, and answer was 1.73. 4410000/5090000 ≈ 0.87, so maybe it's COGS / (ending inventory / 2) = 1.73. So for us: 5540000 / (3760000 / 2) = 5540000 / 1880000 ≈ 2.95.\n\nAlternatively, if it's COGS / ending inventory, then 5540000 / 3760000 ≈ 1.47.\n\nGiven the example's answer was higher than COGS/ending inventory, likely it's COGS / (ending/2). So I'll go with 2.95.\n\n### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:** Total Debt / Total Equity\n\nTotal Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\nTotal Equity = Total Owner's Equity = 11,824,937.81\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 3,054,996.05 / 11,824,937.81 ≈ 0.26\n\n### 5. Quick Ratio\n**Formula:** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 7,660,411.14\n- Inventory = 3,760,000.00\n- Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n\nCalculation:\nQuick Ratio = (7,660,411.14 - 3,760,000.00) / 3,054,996.05 = 3,900,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ 1.28\n\n### 6. Current Ratio\n**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nCurrent Assets = 7,660,411.14\nCurrent Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 7,660,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ 2.51\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '2.95', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.26', 'Quick Ratio': '1.28', 'Current Ratio': '2.51'}}\n```\n\n*Note: There's some ambiguity in the Inventory Turnover Ratio calculation based on the example provided. If the expected method is COGS / Ending Inventory (without averaging), then the ratio would be 1.47. However, based on the example's calculation leading to a higher number, I've used COGS / (Ending Inventory / 2), giving 2.95. Please clarify the intended method if this seems incorrect.*",
