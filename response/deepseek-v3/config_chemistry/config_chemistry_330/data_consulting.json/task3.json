In this case, it's the \"Total Current Liabilities\" because there are no non-current liabilities listed.\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n\n2. **Identify Total Assets**: This is already provided in the balance sheet.\n   - Total Assets = 14,879,933.86\n\n3. **Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio**: This ratio is calculated by dividing Total Liabilities by Total Assets.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{3,054,996.05}{14,879,933.86}\n   \\]\n   - Performing the division: 3,054,996.05 / 14,879,933.86 â‰ˆ 0.2053\n\n4. **Round the Result**: Rounding to two decimal places gives us 0.21.\n\n5. **Present the Answer**: The final answer should be presented as a string with two decimal places.\n\nHere is the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.21'} }\n```",
