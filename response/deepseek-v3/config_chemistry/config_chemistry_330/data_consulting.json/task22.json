                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate the Quick Ratio and the Net Profit Margin based on the provided financial statements. \n\n### Understanding the Terms\n\n**Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio):**\nThis measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable\n  (In this case, it seems we have Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Interest Receivable, and Accounts Receivable. Typically, Inventory is not included in quick assets because it's not as liquid.)\n\n**Net Profit Margin:**\nThis shows how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the balance sheet (end amounts for 2024-01-29):\n- Cash on Hand: 145,666.48\n- Bank Deposits: 194,711.58\n- Interest Receivable: 1,731.44\n- Accounts Receivable: 3,558,301.64\n- Total Current Liabilities: 3,054,996.05\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit: -1,175,062.19\n- Total Revenue: 7,099,920.95\n\n### Calculating Quick Ratio\n\nFirst, let's identify the quick assets:\n1. Cash on Hand: 145,666.48\n2. Bank Deposits: 194,711.58\n3. Interest Receivable: 1,731.44\n4. Accounts Receivable: 3,558,301.64\n\nAdding these up:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 145,666.48 + 194,711.58 + 1,731.44 + 3,558,301.64 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 145,666.48 + 194,711.58 = 340,378.06 \\]\n\\[ 340,378.06 + 1,731.44 = 342,109.50 \\]\n\\[ 342,109.50 + 3,558,301.64 = 3,900,411.14 \\]\n\nNow, the Quick Ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{3,900,411.14}{3,054,996.05} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} \\approx 1.276 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places: 1.28\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the quick ratio was calculated as 1.54, but their quick assets were Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable = 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,672.87 + 2,429,482.13 = 2,866,806.47, and current liabilities were 1,861,550.92, so 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54. \n\nSimilarly, in our case, the calculation seems correct. Maybe the quick assets are only Cash + Accounts Receivable sometimes? Let me check if Interest Receivable is typically included. \n\nUpon checking, quick assets usually include cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Interest receivable might be included if it's expected to be received within a short period, but sometimes it's excluded. For consistency with the example, let's include it.\n\nSo, our calculation seems correct: ~1.28.\n\nBut the example included all, so maybe I missed something. Wait, in the given data, is there any other current asset that's quick? \n\nLooking back, the balance sheet shows Total Current Assets as 7,660,411.14, which includes Inventory (3,760,000.00). So quick assets would be Total Current Assets - Inventory = 7,660,411.14 - 3,760,000.00 = 3,900,411.14, which matches our earlier sum. \n\nSo Quick Ratio = 3,900,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ 1.276, say 1.28.\n\nBut the example had a higher ratio, maybe due to higher receivables relative to liabilities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Bank Deposits are not included in quick assets? But usually, they are (as cash equivalents). \n\nGiven that, I think 1.28 is correct.\n\nBut the example had all included, so perhaps it's standard here to include all. \n\nLet me proceed with 1.28.\n\n### Calculating Net Profit Margin\n\nGiven:\nNet Profit = -1,175,062.19\nTotal Revenue = 7,099,920.95\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{-1,175,062.19}{7,099,920.95} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} \\approx \\left( -0.1655 \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} \\approx -16.55\\% \\]\n\nIn the example, it was:\nNet Profit = -1,645,141.43\nTotal Revenue = 5,431,018.59\n(-1,645,141.43 / 5,431,018.59) * 100 ≈ -30.29%\n\nSo our calculation seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully calculating:\n\n- Quick Ratio: 1.28\n- Net Profit Margin: -16.55%\n\nBut let me double-check the quick assets definition. Sometimes it's just Cash + Accounts Receivable, excluding Interest Receivable.\n\nIf we exclude Interest Receivable:\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable\n= 145,666.48 + 194,711.58 + 3,558,301.64\n= 145,666.48 + 194,711.58 = 340,378.06\n+ 3,558,301.64 = 3,898,679.70\n\nQuick Ratio = 3,898,679.70 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ 1.276 → still ~1.28\n\nAlternatively, maybe Bank Deposits are not included? Unlikely, as they are cash equivalents.\n\nGiven that, I think 1.28 is accurate.\n\nSimilarly, the example had:\n\nQuick Assets = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits + Interest Receivable + Accounts Receivable\n= 270,005.90 + 164,645.57 + 2,672.87 + 2,429,482.13 = 2,866,806.47\nCurrent Liabilities = 1,861,550.92\nQuick Ratio = 2,866,806.47 / 1,861,550.92 ≈ 1.54\n\nSimilarly, in our case, including all:\n\nQuick Assets = 145,666.48 + 194,711.58 + 1,731.44 + 3,558,301.64 = 3,900,411.14\nCurrent Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\nQuick Ratio = 3,900,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ 1.276 → 1.28\n\nSo, it's consistent with the example's method.\n\nNet Profit Margin is straightforward.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.28', 'Net Profit Margin': '-16.55%'} }\n```",
