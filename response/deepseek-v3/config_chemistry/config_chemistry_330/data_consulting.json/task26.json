                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial analysis step by step. We need to calculate three key financial ratios: Return on Equity (ROE), Debt to Asset Ratio, and Gross Profit Margin. I'll go through each one, explaining how to compute them based on the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n**Definition:** ROE measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the **income statement**, the Net Profit is:\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit} = -1,175,062.19 \\]\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**, the Total Owner's Equity at the end is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Owner's Equity} = 11,824,937.81 \\]\n\nNow, plug in the numbers:\n\\[ \\text{ROE} = \\frac{-1,175,062.19}{11,824,937.81} \\times 100 \\]\n\nCalculating the division:\n\\[ \\frac{-1,175,062.19}{11,824,937.81} \\approx -0.0994 \\]\n\nMultiply by 100 for percentage:\n\\[ -0.0994 \\times 100 \\approx -9.94\\% \\]\n\nSo, ROE is approximately **-9.94%**.\n\n### 2. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:** This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed through debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: 3,054,996.05\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n- Total Assets at the end: 14,879,933.86\n\nNow, calculate the ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,054,996.05}{14,879,933.86} \\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\\[ \\frac{3,054,996.05}{14,879,933.86} \\approx 0.205 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately **0.21**.\n\n*Note: Sometimes this ratio is expressed as a percentage, but typically it's left as a decimal. Since the example had it as a decimal, we'll keep it that way.*\n\n### 3. Gross Profit Margin\n\n**Definition:** This shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Gross Profit: 1,559,920.95\n- Total Revenue: 7,099,920.95\n\nNow, calculate:\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{1,559,920.95}{7,099,920.95} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFirst, divide:\n\\[ \\frac{1,559,920.95}{7,099,920.95} \\approx 0.2197 \\]\n\nMultiply by 100:\n\\[ 0.2197 \\times 100 \\approx 21.97\\% \\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **21.97%**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining all the calculated values:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Return on Equity (ROE)': '-9.94%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.21', 'Gross Profit Margin': '21.97%'} }\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify each calculation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **ROE**:\n   - Net Profit: -1,175,062.19\n   - Equity: 11,824,937.81\n   - -1,175,062.19 / 11,824,937.81 ≈ -0.0994 → -9.94% ✔\n\n2. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   - Total Liabilities: 3,054,996.05\n   - Total Assets: 14,879,933.86\n   - 3,054,996.05 / 14,879,933.86 ≈ 0.205 → 0.21 ✔\n\n3. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: 1,559,920.95\n   - Revenue: 7,099,920.95\n   - 1,559,920.95 / 7,099,920.95 ≈ 0.2197 → 21.97% ✔\n\nEverything checks out! The calculations seem correct based on the provided data.",
