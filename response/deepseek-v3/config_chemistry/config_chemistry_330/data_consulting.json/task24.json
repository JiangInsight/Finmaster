                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to break down each ratio to understand how to compute them based on the given financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- **Total Liabilities:** This is the sum of all liabilities. In the given balance sheet, under \"Total Current Liabilities,\" we have:\n  - Accounts Payable: 2,700,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: 354,996.05\n  - Total Current Liabilities: 3,054,996.05\n- There are no non-current liabilities listed, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n- **Total Assets:** 14,879,933.86\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,054,996.05}{14,879,933.86} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3,054,996.05}{14,879,933.86} \\approx 0.205 \\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.21 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\n*Wait a minute*, in the example provided, the ratio was given as '0.14', but let's see how they might have calculated it. Maybe they considered only certain liabilities or perhaps there's a different interpretation. But based on the standard definition and the data provided, it should be Total Liabilities / Total Assets.\n\nLooking back at the example:\n- Total Liabilities: 1,861,550.92\n- Total Assets: 13,216,409.49\n- Ratio: 1,861,550.92 / 13,216,409.49 ≈ 0.14\n\nThat matches the given solution. So, in our case, it's:\n\n3,054,996.05 / 14,879,933.86 ≈ 0.205\n\nBut since the example rounds to two decimal places, we'll do the same: 0.21.\n\n*Alternatively*, maybe \"Debt\" refers only to interest-bearing liabilities. In the given data, there's no mention of interest-bearing debt like loans or bonds, only Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable, which are typically non-interest-bearing. If that's the case, then Debt might be zero, making the ratio zero. But that doesn't align with the example where Accounts Payable was included.\n\nGiven that, I think it's safest to include all liabilities in \"Debt\" for this calculation, leading to 0.21.\n\nBut the example included Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable in liabilities, so I think our calculation is correct.\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Definition:**\nThis ratio compares the cash generated from operating activities to the net income. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -5,394,333.52\n- Net Income (from Income Statement): -1,175,062.19\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-5,394,333.52}{-1,175,062.19} \\]\n\nDividing two negatives gives a positive:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5,394,333.52}{1,175,062.19} \\approx 4.59 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 4.59.\n\nIn the example provided:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -7,259,994.10\n- Net Income: -1,645,141.43\n- Ratio: -7,259,994.10 / -1,645,141.43 ≈ 4.41\n\nOur calculation follows the same method, leading to 4.59.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining both ratios:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: 0.21\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: 4.59\n\nHowever, looking back at the example, the ratios were presented as strings with two decimal places. So, we'll format ours similarly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.21', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '4.59'} }\n```\n\n*Wait*, let me double-check the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio calculation to ensure no mistake.\n\nCalculating:\n\n5,394,333.52 / 1,175,062.19:\n\n- 1,175,062.19 * 4 = 4,700,248.76\n- Subtract from numerator: 5,394,333.52 - 4,700,248.76 = 694,084.76\n- Now, 1,175,062.19 * 0.5 = 587,531.095\n- 694,084.76 - 587,531.095 = 106,553.665\n- 1,175,062.19 * 0.09 = 105,755.5971\n- Remaining: 106,553.665 - 105,755.5971 ≈ 798.0679\n- So, 4 + 0.5 + 0.09 = 4.59\n\nYes, the calculation seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for Debt to Asset Ratio:\n\n3,054,996.05 / 14,879,933.86:\n\n- 14,879,933.86 * 0.2 = 2,975,986.772\n- Remaining: 3,054,996.05 - 2,975,986.772 = 79,009.278\n- 14,879,933.86 * 0.005 = 74,399.6693\n- Remaining: 79,009.278 - 74,399.6693 ≈ 4,609.6087\n- So, 0.2 + 0.005 = 0.205, which rounds to 0.21.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.21', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '4.59'} }\n```",
