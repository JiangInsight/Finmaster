                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. I'm going to calculate two key financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Gross Profit Margin and the Operating Cash Flow Ratio.\n\n### Understanding the Ratios\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**: This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). It's a measure of how efficiently a company uses its resources to produce goods.\n   \n   **Formula**: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: This ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its operations. It indicates the company's short-term liquidity.\n   \n   **Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n### Given Data\n\nFrom the **income statement**:\n- Total Revenue: \\$7,099,920.95\n- Cost of Goods Sold: \\$5,540,000.00\n- Gross Profit: \\$1,559,920.95\n\nFrom the **cash flow statement**:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$5,394,333.52\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**:\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\$3,054,996.05\n\n### Calculating Gross Profit Margin\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\$1,559,920.95}{\\$7,099,920.95} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division first:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\$1,559,920.95}{\\$7,099,920.95} \\approx 0.2197\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:\n\\[\n0.2197 \\times 100 \\approx 21.97\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the Gross Profit Margin is approximately **21.97%**.\n\n### Calculating Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-\\$5,394,333.52}{\\$3,054,996.05}\n\\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[\n\\frac{-\\$5,394,333.52}{\\$3,054,996.05} \\approx -1.766\n\\]\n\nSo, the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately **-1.77**.\n\n### Verifying the Calculations\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - Gross Profit: \\$1,559,920.95\n   - Total Revenue: \\$7,099,920.95\n   - \\$1,559,920.95 / \\$7,099,920.95 ≈ 0.2197 → 21.97%\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -\\$5,394,333.52\n   - Total Current Liabilities: \\$3,054,996.05\n   - -\\$5,394,333.52 / \\$3,054,996.05 ≈ -1.766\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '21.97%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.77'}}\n```\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- **Gross Profit Margin**: A margin of 21.97% means that for every dollar of revenue, the company retains about \\$0.22 after accounting for the cost of goods sold. This seems reasonable, but the actual health depends on industry standards.\n  \n- **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**: A negative ratio (-1.77) indicates that the company's operating activities are not generating enough cash to cover its current liabilities. This could be a sign of financial stress, especially if the negative trend continues. It's important to investigate why operating cash flow is negative—perhaps due to heavy investments in inventory or receivables, as seen in the cash flow statement where increases in accounts receivable and inventory are significant.\n\nUnderstanding these ratios helps in assessing the company's operational efficiency and liquidity position. The negative operating cash flow is concerning and would warrant a deeper dive into the company's operations and cash management strategies.",
