The \"Net Increase\" in the problem is `-7,659,621.94`. \n\nGiven the example's approach, it appears the FCF is equated to the \"Net Increase\" in Cash and Cash Equivalents. Therefore, we will follow the same approach here.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-7659621.94'} }\n```",
