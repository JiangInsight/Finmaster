There are no non-current liabilities listed, so the total debt is **3,054,996.05**.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:  \n   The formula is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]  \n   Plugging in the numbers:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-5,394,333.52}{3,054,996.05} = -1.77\n   \\]\n\n4. **Round the Result to Two Decimal Places**:  \n   The ratio is **-1.77**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```",
