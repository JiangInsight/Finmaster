                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial statement analysis step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the requested ratios one by one using the provided data. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### 1. Current Ratio\n**Definition:** Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount) = 7,660,411.14\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount) = 3,054,996.05\n\nCalculation:\nCurrent Ratio = 7,660,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ 2.51\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n**Definition:** Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 1,559,920.95\n- Total Revenue = 7,099,920.95\n\nCalculation:\nGross Profit Margin = (1,559,920.95 / 7,099,920.95) * 100 ≈ 21.97%\n\n### 3. Debt to Asset Ratio\n**Definition:** Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (since no long-term liabilities are listed) = 3,054,996.05\n- Total Assets = 14,879,933.86\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 3,054,996.05 / 14,879,933.86 ≈ 0.205 or 20.5%\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the example, the Debt to Asset Ratio was calculated as Total Current Liabilities / Total Assets, but traditionally, it's Total Liabilities / Total Assets. Here, since only current liabilities are present, it's the same. So, 0.205 or 20.5%.\n\nBut the example showed it as a decimal (0.14), not a percentage. So, I'll present it as 0.21.\n\n### 4. Net Profit Margin\n**Definition:** Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -1,175,062.19\n- Total Revenue = 7,099,920.95\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (-1,175,062.19 / 7,099,920.95) * 100 ≈ -16.55%\n\n### 5. Cash to Current Debt Ratio\n**Definition:** Cash to Current Debt Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Cash on Hand (End_amount) = 145,666.48\n- Bank Deposits (End_amount) = 194,711.58\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 145,666.48 + 194,711.58 = 340,378.06\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n\nCalculation:\nCash to Current Debt Ratio = 340,378.06 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ 0.111 or 0.11\n\n### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n**Definition:** Free Cash Flow is typically calculated as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures (Purchase of Fixed Assets).\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,394,333.52\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets (Investing Activities) = 2,265,288.42\n\nBut FCF is often calculated as Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures. Here, Operating Cash Flow is already net, and Capital Expenditures are the purchase of fixed assets.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the example, FCF was taken as the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents, which was -7,565,348.53.\n\nIn this problem:\nNet Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents = -7,659,621.94\n\nSo, following the example, FCF = -7,659,621.94\n\n### 7. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Definition:** ROA = (Net Profit / Total Assets) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -1,175,062.19\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 14,879,933.86\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (-1,175,062.19 / 14,879,933.86) * 100 ≈ -7.90%\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '2.51', 'Gross Profit Margin': '21.97%', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.21', 'Net Profit Margin': '-16.55%', 'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '0.11', 'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-7659621.94', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-7.90%'} }\n```\n\n### Verification:\nLet me double-check each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: 7,660,411.14 / 3,054,996.05 = 2.507 ≈ 2.51 ✅\n2. **Gross Profit Margin**: 1,559,920.95 / 7,099,920.95 = 0.2197 → 21.97% ✅\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: 3,054,996.05 / 14,879,933.86 ≈ 0.205 → 0.21 ✅\n4. **Net Profit Margin**: -1,175,062.19 / 7,099,920.95 ≈ -0.1655 → -16.55% ✅\n5. **Cash to Current Debt Ratio**: 340,378.06 / 3,054,996.05 ≈ 0.111 → 0.11 ✅\n6. **FCF**: Following the example, it's the net increase in cash: -7,659,621.94 ✅\n7. **ROA**: -1,175,062.19 / 14,879,933.86 ≈ -0.079 → -7.90% ✅\n\nEverything checks out! The final JSON is correct.",
