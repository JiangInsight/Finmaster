                        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this financial ratio calculation step by step. I'm going to calculate each of the four requested ratios based on the provided financial statements. Here's how I'll approach each one:\n\n### 1. Debt to Equity Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nDebt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (which seems to be the only liabilities listed) = 3,054,996.05\n- Total Owner's Equity = 11,824,937.81\n\nCalculation:\nDebt to Equity Ratio = 3,054,996.05 / 11,824,937.81 ≈ 0.258\n\n### 2. Net Profit Margin\n**Formula:**  \nNet Profit Margin = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) * 100\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = -1,175,062.19\n- Total Revenue = 7,099,920.95\n\nCalculation:\nNet Profit Margin = (-1,175,062.19 / 7,099,920.95) * 100 ≈ -16.55%\n\n### 3. Return on Assets (ROA)\n**Formula:**  \nROA = (Net Profit / Average Total Assets) * 100  \nSince we only have end-of-period assets, we'll use that as an approximation (though ideally, we'd average beginning and ending assets).\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets at end = 14,879,933.86\n- Net Profit = -1,175,062.19\n\nCalculation:\nROA = (-1,175,062.19 / 14,879,933.86) * 100 ≈ -7.90%\n\n### 4. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n**Formula:**  \nAccounts Receivable Turnover = Total Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable  \nAgain, using ending accounts receivable since initial is 0.\n\nFrom the income statement and balance sheet:\n- Total Revenue = 7,099,920.95\n- Accounts Receivable at end = 3,558,301.64\n- Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.00\n\nAverage Accounts Receivable = (0 + 3,558,301.64) / 2 = 1,779,150.82\n\nCalculation:\nAccounts Receivable Turnover = 7,099,920.95 / 1,779,150.82 ≈ 3.99\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.26', 'Net Profit Margin': '-16.55%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-7.90%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.99'}}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\nLet me double-check each calculation quickly.\n\n1. Debt to Equity: 3,054,996.05 / 11,824,937.81 ≈ 0.258 → 0.26 (rounded)\n2. Net Profit Margin: -1,175,062.19 / 7,099,920.95 ≈ -0.1655 → -16.55%\n3. ROA: -1,175,062.19 / 14,879,933.86 ≈ -0.079 → -7.90%\n4. AR Turnover: 7,099,920.95 / 1,779,150.82 ≈ 3.99\n\nEverything checks out! The slight differences from the example might be due to rounding or different assumptions (like using average vs. ending figures), but the methods are correct.",
