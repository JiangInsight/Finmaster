                        "content": "To generate a complete balance sheet based on the provided transaction data, we'll go through each type of account and calculate the initial and ending values based on the transactions.\n\n1. **Determine Initial Values**:\n   - Cash on Hand: $3,000,000\n   - Bank Deposits: $5,000,000\n   - Accounts Receivable: $0\n   - Interest Receivable: $0\n   - Inventory: $0\n   - Fixed Assets: $5,000,000\n   - Accumulated Depreciation: $0\n   - Accounts Payable: $0\n   - Taxes Payable: $0\n   - Shareholder's Equity (Paid-in Capital): $13,000,000\n   - Retained Earnings: $0\n\n   - Total Current Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable + Inventory = $8,000,000\n   - Total Non-current Assets = Fixed Assets - Accumulated Depreciation = $5,000,000\n   - Total Assets = Total Current Assets + Total Non-current Assets = $13,000,000\n   - Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = $0\n   - Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity = Total Current Liabilities + Paid-in Capital + Retained Earnings = $13,000,000\n\n2. **Process Transactions to Calculate Ending Values**:\n   - We will adjust cash and bank accounts for each cash transaction (inflows and outflows).\n   - Update inventory based on purchases and depreciation.\n   - Adjust accounts receivable based on sales.\n   - Update accounts payable based on purchases.\n   - Adjust for expenses and their impact on retained earnings.\n\n3. **Calculate Ending Values**:\n   - After processing all transactions, we arrive at the updated values.\n\n### Calculation Breakdown:\n\n**Cash Account**  \n- Initial Cash on Hand: $3,000,000  \n- Adjustments from transactions:\n  - Cash Payments: $222,671.64 (sum of all cash payments based on the categorized data)  \n  - Cash Receipts: $263,302.76 (sum of all cash receipts/transactions)  \n- Ending Cash = Initial Cash + Cash Receipts - Cash Payments = $3,000,000 + $263,302.76 - $222,671.64 = $3,040,631.12  \n\n**Bank Deposits Account**  \n- Initial Bank Deposits: $5,000,000  \n- Adjustments from transactions:\n  - Bank Payments: $1,702,456.67  \n  - Bank Receipts: $1,577,217.47  \n- Ending Bank Deposits = Initial Bank + Bank Receipts - Bank Payments = $5,000,000 + $1,577,217.47 - $1,702,456.67 = $4,874,760.80  \n\n**Accounts Receivable**  \n- Starting with $0, we add sales made on credit and increase based on unpaid invoices:\n  - Sales (credit) = $1,510,316 (this is derived as per each credit sale)  \n- Ending Accounts Receivable = $1,510,316  \n\n**Interest Receivable**  \n- Cumulative unpaid interest: $8,280.54\n- Ending Interest Receivable = Initial + Cumulative Unpaid Interest = $0 + $8,280.54 = $8,280.54  \n\n**Inventory**  \n- Starting inventory of $0 + Purchases - Cost of Goods Sold:\n- Total Purchases made = $1,745,000 (sum of all purchases)\n- Total Sales = $1,124,051 for items sold from inventory.\n- Ending Inventory = Purchases – COGS = $1,745,000 – $1,124,051 = $620,949.\n\n**Fixed Assets**  \n- Initial Fixed Assets: $5,000,000  \n- Post-purchase adjustment: - Depreciation = $53,586.02  \n- Ending Fixed Assets = Initial + Purchases - Depreciation = $5,000,000 + $0 - $53,586.02 = $4,946,413.98  \n\n**Accounts Payable**  \n- Total Purchases on credit (unpaid): $1,482,000 (sum of unpaid purchases)\n- Ending Accounts Payable = $1,482,000  \n\n**Total Assets**  \n- Total Current Assets = Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable + Inventory  \n- Total Non-current Assets = Fixed Assets  \n- Total Assets = Total Current Assets + Total Non-current Assets  \n\n**Total Liabilities**  \n- Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable: $1,482,000 + $0\n- Owner's Equity = Paid-in Capital + Retained Earnings:  \n- Ending Retained Earnings need to be adjusted by all expenses, which lead to reduction.\n\nNow putting everything in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    'Cash on Hand Initial Value': '3000000.00', \n    'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', \n    'Interest Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', \n    'Accounts Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', \n    'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', \n    'Total Current Assets Initial Value': '8000000.00', \n    'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', \n    'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', \n    'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', \n    'Total Assets Initial Value': '13000000.00', \n    'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', \n    'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', \n    'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', \n    'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', \n    'Retained Earnings Initial Value': '0.00', \n    \"Total Owner's Equity Initial Value\": '13000000.00', \n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value\": '13000000.00', \n    'Cash on Hand End Value': '304631.12', \n    'Bank Deposits End Value': '4874760.80', \n    'Interest Receivable End Value': '8280.54', \n    'Accounts Receivable End Value': '1510316.00', \n    'Inventory End Value': '620949.00', \n    'Total Current Assets End Value': '2048191.46', \n    'Fixed Assets End Value': '4946413.98', \n    'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '53586.02', \n    'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '4946413.98', \n    'Total Assets End Value': '2048191.46', \n    'Accounts Payable End Value': '1482000.00', \n    'Taxes Payable End Value': '0.00', \n    'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '1482000.00', \n    'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00', \n    'Retained Earnings End Value': '-1465684.34', \n    \"Total Owner's Equity End Value\": '11334315.66', \n    \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value\": '2048191.46'\n}}\n``` \n\nThe values in the final calculation will need to include checks against actual calculations during row processing to ensure they are reach credible outputs.
