From the provided data, we can see initial capital is represented by cash deposits, bank deposits, and fixed asset purchases. \n\nThe relevant entries are:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets purchase (considering it's a component of contributions): 5,000,000.0\n\n**Calculation for Initial Paid-in Capital:**\n```\nInitial Paid-in Capital = Cash deposit + Bank deposit + Fixed Assets purchase\n                        = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000\n                        = 13,000,000.0\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify End Paid-in Capital\n\nThe Paid-in Capital could be affected by purchases related to assets, which do not alter the paid-in capital but reflect investments in the firm's operations. Payments related to purchases, expenses, etc., do not contribute to the paid-in capital but instead affect the operational profits and losses.\n\nIn the provided dataset, there are no additional contributions or withdrawals that would change the initial Paid-in Capital amount.\n\nSince the recorded total follows the same original contributions without any further capital injections or payments back to investors, the End Paid-in Capital remains the same as the initial.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n```\nEnd Paid-in Capital = Initial Paid-in Capital = 13,000,000.0\n```\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the solution in the required format\n\nThe final values to be presented in the solution format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n``` \n\nHence, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
