                        "content": "To calculate the total owner's equity from the provided data, we will follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Initialization\nIdentify all records that contribute to the initial owner's equity and subsequent transactions that affect it:\n\n- **Initial Transactions**:\n  These are the entries categorized as deposits or contributions to equity, as well as any purchases that may impact available equity.\n\n- **Expenses**:\n  These reduce the owner's equity.\n\n- **Sales**:\n  These increase the owner’s equity.\n\n- **Interest Receivables**:\n  Depending on their status, they may or may not affect equity directly.\n\n### 2. Calculate Initial Owner’s Equity\nSum the initial deposits to find the starting owner's equity:\n\n- Cash Deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank Deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.0\n\n**Initial Owner’s Equity Calculation**:\n- \\( \\text{Initial Owner's Equity} = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.0 \\)\n\n### 3. Calculate Changes in Owner’s Equity\nNow, we summarize the changes to equity, using transactions:\n\n- **Total Expenses**:\n  Add all the 'expenses' amounts recorded.\n\n- **Total Sales**:\n  Add all the 'sales' amounts recorded.\n\n### 4. Expenses and Profits Calculation\n**Listing of Expenses**:\n- Administrative Expenses: 22,978.51 + 24,053.38 + ... (sum of all such entries)\n  \nCalculating all the listed expenses:\n- Total Expenses Amount: \n  - \\( 22,978.51 + 24,053.38 + 45,748.43 + ... = 228,709.10 \\)\n\n**Listing of Sales**:\n- Sale Records: \n  Originating from Sale records, summing those amounts:\n  \nCalculating the sales:\n- Total Sales Amount: \n  - \\( 36,215.84 + 59,124.48 + ... = 1,162,607.58 \\) (sum of all sales)\n\n### 5. Calculate Final Equity\nUsing the owner's equity accounting equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Final Owner's Equity} = \\text{Initial Owner's Equity} + \\text{Total Sales} - \\text{Total Expenses}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n- Initial Owner's Equity = 13,000,000.0\n- Total Sales Amount = 1,162,607.58\n- Total Expenses Amount = 228,709.10\n\n\\[\n\\text{Final Owner's Equity} = 13,000,000.0 + 1,162,607.58 - 228,709.10 = 13,932,898.48\n\\]\n\n### Final Output\nFormat the results as specified:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '13932898.48'}}\n```",
