We will take note of whether the amounts are positive or negative.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Interest Receivable Change**: We will sum up all recorded amounts to find the net change in interest receivable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nNow, letâ€™s extract the relevant transactions related to interest receivables from the provided data:\n\n- Interest Receivables Transactions:\n  1. Date: 2024-01-01, Amount: **417.41** (Unpaid)\n  2. Date: 2024-01-02, Amount: **379.14** (Unpaid)\n  3. Date: 2024-01-03, Amount: **340.97** (Unpaid)\n  4.

Date: 2024-01-07, Amount: **330.29** (Unpaid)\n  8. Date: 2024-01-08, Amount: **330.29** (Unpaid)\n  9. Date: 2024-01-09, Amount: **330.29** (Unpaid)\n  10. Date: 2024-01-10, Amount: **330.29** (Unpaid)\n  11. Date: 2024-01-11, Amount: **323.17** (Unpaid)\n  12. Date: 2024-01-12, Amount: **323.17** (Unpaid)\n  13. Date: 2024-01-13, Amount: **323.17** (Unpaid)\n  14. Date: 2024-01-14, Amount: **313.78** (Unpaid)\n  15. Date: 2024-01-15, Amount: **313.78** (Unpaid)\n  16. Date: 2024-01-16, Amount: **313.78** (Unpaid)\n  17. Date: 2024-01-17, Amount: **313.78** (Unpaid)\n  18. Date: 2024-01-18, Amount: **303.29** (Unpaid)\n  19. Date: 2024-01-19, Amount: **303.29** (Unpaid)\n  20. Date: 2024-01-20, Amount: **303.29** (Unpaid)\n  21. Date: 2024-01-21, Amount: **303.29** (Unpaid)\n  22. Date: 2024-01-22, Amount: **299.28** (Unpaid)\n  23. Date: 2024-01-23, Amount: **299.28** (Unpaid)\n  24. Date: 2024-01-24, Amount: **272.58** (Unpaid)\n  25. Date: 2024-01-25, Amount: **272.58** (Unpaid)\n  26. Date: 2024-01-26, Amount: **268.13** (Unpaid)\n  27. Date: 2024-01-27, Amount: **261.55** (Unpaid)\n\n### Total Calculation\n\nNow we will sum up all the recorded amounts:\n\n```\nTotal = 417.41 + 379.14 + 340.97 + 340.97 + 340.97 + 340.97 + 330.29 + 330.29 + \n        330.29 + 330.29 + 323.17 + 323.17 + 323.17 + 313.78 + 313.78 + 313.78 + \n        313.78 + 303.29 + 303.29 + 303.29 + 303.29 + 299.28 + 299.28 + 272.58 + \n        272.58 + 268.13 + 261.55\n```\n\nCalculating the sum gives:\n\nTotal Amount = 3921.16 (summed from all unpaid interest and treated as a positive amount).\n\n### Final Steps\n\nNow we will assess the total change in the interest receivable and express it for the cash flow statement context.\n\nNow considering this is an \"Increase\" of Interest Receivable:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '3921.16'} }\n```",
