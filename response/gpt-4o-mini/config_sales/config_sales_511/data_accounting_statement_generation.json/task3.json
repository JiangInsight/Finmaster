                        "content": "To calculate the inventory values, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify inventory purchases and sales from the transaction data.\n2. Calculate the total initial inventory value on the date specified, which is 2023-12-31.\n3. Calculate all the purchases made after that date until 2024-01-30, which realize the changes in inventory.\n4. Calculate all the sales made during that period which affect the inventory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n#### Initial Inventory Value (before any purchases)\nFrom the transactions, we can see there are a few purchases:\n- **For Chemical Product A (P001)** (10 units, total cost 50,000.0) on 2023-12-31\n- **For Chemical Product B (P002)** (10 units, total cost 100,000.0) on 2023-12-31\n- **For Chemical Product C (P003)** (8 units, total cost 160,000.0) on 2023-12-31\n- **For Chemical Product D (P004)** (5 units, total cost 250,000.0) on 2023-12-31\n\nThe total initial inventory value can be calculated simply as the sum of the total cost from the purchase entries:\n\n- Initial Inventory Value = 0 (No prior listed inventory)\n\n#### Purchases Made After 2023-12-31\nNext, we will look for purchases made after the 2023-12-31 to calculate the end inventory value.\n1. **P001 (Chemical Product A)**:\n   - 5 units purchased for 10,000.0 on 2023-12-31\n   - 3 units purchased for 5,000.0 on 2024-01-30\n   - Total units = 18 (10+5+3) \n   - Total cost = 50,000 + 10,000 + 15,000 = 75,000\n\n2. **P002 (Chemical Product B)**:\n   - 10 units purchased for 10,000.0 on 2023-12-31\n   - 4 units purchased for 10,000 on 2024-01-30\n   - Total units = 14 (10+4)\n   - Total cost = 100,000 + 10,000 = 110,000\n\n3. **P003 (Chemical Product C)**:\n   - 4 units purchased for 10,000 on 2023-12-31\n   - 4 units purchased for 10,000 on 2024-01-30\n   - Total units = 8 (8)\n   - Total cost = 160,000 + 20,000 = 180,000\n\n4. **P004 (Chemical Product D)**:\n   - 8 units purchased for 10,000.0 on 2023-12-31\n   - 7 units purchased for 10,000 on 2024-01-30\n   - Total units = 15 (5+10) \n   - Total cost = 250,000 + 40,000 = 290,000\n\n#### Total Sales Made Affecting Inventory\nNext, we will track the sales to understand what affects the end inventory. Sales transactions where products were sold:\n\n1. Sales affecting P001: \n   - Products sold = 1 unit (sold for 12,468.0, which is dismissed for end stock calculation twice if not part of inventory due to not being traded.).\n\n2. Sales affecting Products Prices:\n   - P002: 4 units are sold.\n   - P004: 3 units are sold.\n\n### Inventory Total Calculation\n1. **Total Purchases (calculated)**:\n   - P001 = 75,000\n   - P002 = 110,000\n   - P003 = 180,000\n   - P004 = 290,000\n   - Total Purchases = 75 + 110 + 180 + 290 = 655,000\n\n2. **Sales volumes** could be voided because the amounts do not affect the purchase price, and sold else out.\n\n#### Final Inventory valuation:\n- The final inventory value will depend on added stock, minus sales will give 5090000 as total assets from inventory.\n\nTo sum it up, the complete evaluations are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '655000.00'} }\n```",
