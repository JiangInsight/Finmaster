                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio, we must first identify total liabilities and total assets from the balance sheet.\n\n1. **Total Assets**: From the provided balance sheet, the \"Total Assets\" amount at the end of the reporting period (2024-01-27) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Assets} = 14823650.85\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Liabilities**: The total liabilities can be determined from the line items concerning liabilities. In this case, we have:\n   - Accounts Payable: 450000.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 278279.50\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 728279.50\n\n   The total liabilities at the end of the reporting period would thus be equal to the total current liabilities since no other long-term liabilities are provided. \n\n   Therefore, the total liabilities amount at the end of the reporting period is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Liabilities} = 728279.50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio Calculation**: \nThe Debt to Asset Ratio can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we calculated:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{728279.50}{14823650.85}\n\\]\n\n4. Performing the calculation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} \\approx 0.0492\n   \\]\n\n5. Finally, we'll express this ratio as a decimal rounded to two decimal places:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} \\approx 0.05\n   \\]\n\nPutting this into the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.05'} }\n```",
