                        "content": "To calculate the requested financial ratios, we will first pull the necessary figures from the provided financial statements (balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement). \n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThe Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n- Total Revenue = 5,565,589.48\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning Accounts Receivable + Ending Accounts Receivable) / 2\n  - Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (initial amount) \n  - Ending Accounts Receivable = 1,502,354.84\n  - Average Accounts Receivable = (0 + 1,502,354.84) / 2 = 751,177.42\n\nNow we can calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,565,589.48}{751,177.42} = 7.41\n\\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -81,548.37\n- Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n\nNow we can calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-81,548.37}{728,279.50} = -0.11\n\\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio. Therefore:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = -0.11\n\\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThe Total Asset Turnover Ratio is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n\\]\n- Total Revenue = 5,565,589.48\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2\n  - Beginning Total Assets = 13,000,000.00\n  - Ending Total Assets = 14,823,650.85\n  - Average Total Assets = (13,000,000.00 + 14,823,650.85) / 2 = 13,911,825.43\n\nNow we can calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,565,589.48}{13,911,825.43} \\approx 0.40\n\\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n\\]\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 728,279.50\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14,095,371.35\n\nNow we can calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{728,279.50}{14,095,371.35} \\approx 0.05\n\\]\n\n### Final Output\nNow we can compile all of these results into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.41', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.11', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.11', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.40', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05'}}\n```",
