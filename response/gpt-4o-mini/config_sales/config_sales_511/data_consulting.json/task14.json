In many cases, if not provided, we would assume that all revenues are on credit.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Average Accounts Receivable\n\n- The average accounts receivable is calculated as:\n  \\( \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Initial Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable}}{2} \\)\n\n- From the balance sheet, the Initial Accounts Receivable was **0** (2023-12-31), and the Ending Accounts Receivable is **1,502,354.84**.\n  \nSo, the Average Accounts Receivable is:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 1502354.84}{2} = \\frac{1502354.84}{2} = 751177.42\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\n- The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n- Net Credit Sales = **5,565,589.48**\n- Average Accounts Receivable = **751,177.42**\n\nSo, \n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5565589.48}{751177.42} \\approx 7.41\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Present the Solution\n\nFinally, we write the result in the given JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.41'}}\n```",
