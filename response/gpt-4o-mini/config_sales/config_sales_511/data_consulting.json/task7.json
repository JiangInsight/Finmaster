In this case:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = **-81,548.37**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Cash Flow from Investing Activities**\n\nThe cash flow from investing activities is also provided directly:\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = **-676,195.87**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF)**\n\nFree Cash Flow is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities} + \\text{Cash Flow from Investing Activities} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{FCF} = -81,548.37 + (-676,195.87)\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{FCF} = -81,548.37 - 676,195.87 = -757,744.24\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Present the Final Answer**\n\nNow that we have calculated the Free Cash Flow, we can format it in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-757744.24'} }\n```",
