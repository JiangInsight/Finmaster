This typically includes only the current liabilities in this case as no long-term liabilities were specified.\n\n3. **Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Use the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 1: Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nFrom the cash flow data provided:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: **-81,548.37**\n\n### Step 2: Total Debt\nFrom the balance sheet data:\n- Total Current Liabilities (which includes accounts payable and taxes payable): \n  - Accounts Payable: **450,000.00**\n  - Taxes Payable: **278,279.50**\n  \nSo, the Total Debt:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Debt} = 450,000.00 + 278,279.50 = 728,279.50\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio Calculation\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-81,548.37}{728,279.50} \\approx -0.1112\n\\]\n\nTo express this in a more readable format, it can be represented as:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} \\approx -0.11 (or -11.12\\%)\n\\]\n\nFinally, we will format the answer in JSON format as specified:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.11'}}\n```",
