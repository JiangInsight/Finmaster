The balance sheet provides the inventory on two dates:\n   - **End amount (current inventory)**: Inventory as of January 27, 2024:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ending Inventory} = 440000.00\n   \\]\n\n   Since there is no beginning inventory disclosed directly in the balance sheet, we will use the information indirectly available.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Average Inventory\n\nTo find the average inventory, we generally take the ending inventory and the previous period's inventory. However, in the absence of that historical data, we often might assume that the beginning inventory was zero or similar based on the data context given.\n\nSince the problem does not provide a beginning inventory figure, we can proceed with the ending inventory in its current state as a simplification:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Ending Inventory}}{2} (Assuming Beginning Inventory was around similar to current ending)\n\\]\nHowever, since our ending inventory indicates a specific point in time, we consider the entire year for the rotation for simplicity:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\text{Ending Inventory} = 440000.00\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Inventory Turnover Ratio\n\nNow we can calculate the inventory turnover using the simplified average:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} = \\frac{3020000}{440000}\n\\]\n\nNow we calculate the ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3020000}{440000} \\approx 6.86\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Present the Result\n\nNow we can present the solution as per instruction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '6.86'} }\n```",
