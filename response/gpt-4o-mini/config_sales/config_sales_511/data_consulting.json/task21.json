Given that we have the ending balance of current assets, we'll assume the initial amount is the previous year's ending balance. However, since the initial amounts aren't needed for the calculations directly, we will just use the ending balance for this calculation. \n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Current Assets (End Amount)**: `9193203.41`\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Total Revenue**: `5565589.48`\n\nNow calculating the Current Assets Turnover Ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5565589.48}{9193203.41} \\approx 0.605\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Final Presentation\n\nNow we summarize our results into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-757744.24', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.605'} }\n```\n\nThis presents the calculated FCF and Current Assets Turnover Ratio appropriately.",
