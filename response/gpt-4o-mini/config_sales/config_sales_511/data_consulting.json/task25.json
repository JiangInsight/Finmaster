                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate three financial metrics: the Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio. We will use the data provided in the balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement for these calculations.\n\n### Step 1: Debt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Liabilities by Total Owner's Equity.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity\n- Total Liabilities = 14823650.85 - 14095371.35 = 728279.50\n- Total Owner's Equity = 14095371.35\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} = \\frac{728279.50}{14095371.35} \\approx 0.0517\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Net Profit Margin\nThe Net Profit Margin is calculated by dividing Net Profit by Total Revenue.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 1095371.35\n- Total Revenue = 5565589.48\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 = \\frac{1095371.35}{5565589.48} \\times 100 \\approx 19.64\\%\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is calculated by dividing Cash Flow from Operating Activities by Total Current Liabilities.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -81548.37\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = 728279.50\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{-81548.37}{728279.50} \\approx -0.11197 \\approx -0.112\n\\]\n\nCombining all the results together:\n1. Debt to Equity Ratio ≈ 0.0517\n2. Net Profit Margin ≈ 19.64%\n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio ≈ -0.112\n\n### Final Answer\nWe will round and format the final output for the solution.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.64%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.11'}}\n```",
