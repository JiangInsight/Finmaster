The Purchase of Fixed Assets\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Profit**: In the cash flow statement, the line item for net profit is explicitly labeled as \"Net Profit\". The amount associated with it is **1095371.35**.\n\n2. **Identify the Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The line item that relates to the investment in long-term assets (property, plant, and equipment) is labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\". The amount associated with it is **676195.87**.\n\n3. **Maintaining Original Line Item Order**: \n   - The extracted values must retain the same order as they appear in the cash flow statement:\n     - First, we should list the Net Profit amount.\n     - Second, we should list the Purchase of Fixed Assets amount.\n\nNow, we can form our solution.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1095371.35', 'value2': '676195.87'}}\n```",
