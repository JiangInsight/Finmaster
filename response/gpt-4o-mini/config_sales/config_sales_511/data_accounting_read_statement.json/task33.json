The two required items are:\n\n1. **Main Business Revenue**: This represents the income arising from the entity's core operating activities.\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Extract the line for Main Business Revenue**: \n   - From the statement, we see the line:\n     - Main Business Revenue | 5565589.48 \n\n2. **Extract the line for Cost of Goods Sold**: \n   - From the statement, we see the line:\n     - Cost of Goods Sold | 3020000.00 \n\nNow that we have both the values, let's compile them into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5565589.48', 'value2': '3020000.00'} }\n``` \n\nThis output includes the values in the exact order specified in the problem statement (Main Business Revenue first followed by Cost of Goods Sold).",
