In this income statement, that line is present.\n\n2. **Extract the amount**: The amount associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) is provided as 3020000.00.\n\n3. **Formulate the solution**: Since we identified \"Cost of Goods Sold\" as the relevant line item reflecting the carrying amount of inventories sold, we will utilize the associated amount of 3020000.00 in our solution.\n\nThus, we format this information in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3020000.00'} }\n```",
