In this case, it is labeled as \"Tax Expense\".\n\n2. **Extract Value**: The value associated with the \"Tax Expense\" line item will represent the total amount of tax that the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period.\n\n3. **Record the Amount**: The amount recorded next to \"Tax Expense\" is 278279.50.\n\nNow, compiling this information into the required JSON format, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '278279.50'} }\n```",
