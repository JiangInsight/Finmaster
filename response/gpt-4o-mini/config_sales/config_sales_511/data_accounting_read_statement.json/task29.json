In the given data, the \"Total Revenue\" is:\n   - Value: **5565589.48**\n   \n2. **Constituent Line Items**: We have the following components that contribute to the Total Revenue:\n   - **Main Business Revenue**: 5565589.48\n\n3. **Decompose into Sub-Items**: There is one sub-item that contributes to the Total Revenue, which is \"Main Business Revenue\".\n\n4. **Initial and Final Values**: Since there is only one sub-item, its initial and final values are the same:\n   - Initial Value: **5565589.48**\n   - Final Value: **5565589.48**\n\nNow, we can format our findings in the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5565589.48', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '5565589.48'}} }\n```",
