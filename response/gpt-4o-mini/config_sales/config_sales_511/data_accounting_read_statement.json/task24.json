In this case, it's stated as \"Administrative Expenses\" with an amount of **278023.19**. This figure represents the costs associated with general management and administration.\n\nNo other line items appear to fall under the category of general management and administration. \n\n2. **Selling Expenses**, **Depreciation**, **Financial Expenses**, and other listed expenses either represent operational expenses or other types of costs that do not pertain directly to general management and administration.\n\nTherefore, the only relevant amount for costs of general management and administration is from the \"Administrative Expenses\" line.\n\nGiven this analysis, the extracted value is **278023.19**.\n\nThus, the final answer is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '278023.19'} }\n```",
