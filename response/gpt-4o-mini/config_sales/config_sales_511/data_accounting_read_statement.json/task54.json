This typically reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company.\n   - Additionally, we also consider **Selling Expenses**, which can include costs associated with selling, marketing, and delivering the products to customers.\n\n3. **Extracting Values from Income Statement**:\n   - From the provided income statement:\n     - **Cost of Goods Sold**: 3020000.00\n     - **Selling Expenses**: 662884.34\n\n4. **Calculating Total Costs**: \n   - These are key costs incurred in delivering goods/services to customers. Hence, we will sum these two values for a comprehensive look at the costs:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Costs} = \\text{Cost of Goods Sold} + \\text{Selling Expenses} = 3020000.00 + 662884.34 = 3682884.34\n     \\]\n\nHowever, since the task specifically requests for the line item value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services, we will extract the **Selling Expenses** value, as COGS is typically sufficient for deliveries.\n\n5. **Final Extraction**:\n   - The solution requires only the **Selling Expenses** value:\n     - Value = 662884.34\n\nPutting it into the required format yields:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '662884.34'} }\n```",
