This indicates a decrease in inventory during the period, which could signify that inventories were sold.\n\n3. **Income Statement**: This statement lists the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), which is the total cost of the inventory sold during the period. The COGS is reported as 3,020,000.00 for the reporting period.\n\nThe COGS gives us the amount we are looking for because it directly represents the carrying amount of inventories that were sold during the reporting period.\n\nSo, the value of inventories sold during the reporting period is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3020000.00'} }\n```",
