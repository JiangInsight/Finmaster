In the given balance sheet data, these include:\n   - Fixed Assets\n   - Accumulated Depreciation (although it's a contra asset, its inclusion will help understand net Fixed Assets).\n\n2. **Extraction of Values**:\n   - From the provided data:\n     - **Fixed Assets**: \n       - Initial Amount: 5,000,000.00 \n       - End Amount: 5,676,195.87 \n     - **Accumulated Depreciation**: \n       - Although \"Accumulated Depreciation\" may not seem like an asset on its own, it's crucial to understand the net corresponding value of the fixed assets. However, for our task, we'll focus primarily on Fixed Assets since they represent the total non-current assets relevant to our calculation.\n   - **Total Non-current Assets**:\n     - Initial Amount: 5,000,000.00 \n     - End Amount: 5,630,447.44 \n\nGiven the context of the problem, we should focus primarily on the **Total Non-current Assets** value extracted directly:\n\n- **Initial Value**: 5,000,000.00\n- **End Value**: 5,630,447.44\n\n3. **Final JSON Format**:\nWe'll format the final answer based on the requirements.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5630447.44'} }\n```",
