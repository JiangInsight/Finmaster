A negative value here indicates that accounts receivable has decreased, meaning that cash has been collected from customers who previously owed money for credit sales.\n\nLet's analyze the given cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Line Item Analysis**:\n    - The relevant line is \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" with a value of **-1502354.84**.\n\nSince this is a negative value, it indicates a decrease in accounts receivable, which aligns with the requirement of finding the amount owed that has decreased during the period.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, we can report our findings in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1502354.84'} }\n```",
