The value here is **8592.81**.\n11. **Profit Before Tax**: This is the profit made before tax considerations and isnâ€™t specifically the income from financial assets.\n12. **Tax Expense**: This reflects the tax obligations and does not reflect asset income.\n13. **Net Profit**: This is the final profit figure after all expenses and taxes, again not specifically indicating income from financial assets.\n\nBased on this breakdown, the line item we need directly identifying income from financial assets is \"Interest Income,\" which is **8592.81**.\n\nTherefore, the solution is structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8592.81'}}\n```",
