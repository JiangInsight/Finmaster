Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services (which corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold\").\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment, and other long-term assets (which corresponds to the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\").\n\nLet's go through each financial statement in the specified order:\n\n### Balance Sheet\n- This statement doesn't include any line items directly related to costs incurred for customer orders or cash payments for assets we're looking for.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: From the entry in the cash flow statement, it indicates a cash payment made for acquiring fixed assets and is valued at **676195.87**.\n\n### Income Statement\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: This entry shows the cost incurred for delivering the goods and services, valued at **3020000.00**.\n\nAfter summarizing, we have:\n\n- Costs incurred to deliver goods and services: **3020000.00**\n- Cash payments for acquiring fixed assets: **676195.87**\n\nNow, organizing the extracted values according to the requirements where:\n- `value1` is for costs incurred to deliver goods and services (Cost of Goods Sold).\n- `value2` is for cash payments for acquiring fixed assets.\n\nTherefore, the correct values are:\n- `value1` = 3020000.00\n- `value2` = 676195.87\n\nNow presenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3020000.00', 'value2': '676195.87'} }\n```",
