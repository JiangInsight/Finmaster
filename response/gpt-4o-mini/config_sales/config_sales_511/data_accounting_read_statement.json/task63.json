We can find the total Cash and Cash Equivalents in the Cash Flow Statement, but we need to ensure that it aligns with the totals found in the Balance Sheet.\n\n   - **Cash on Hand**: 4303451.63\n   - **Bank Deposits**: 2938804.13\n   - The total cash and cash equivalents (Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits) is:\n     ```\n     Cash and Cash Equivalents Total = 4303451.63 + 2938804.13 = 7242255.76\n     ```\n\n2. **Income Statement**: We are tasked with obtaining the total income arising from the ordinary activities of the entity. This can typically be represented by the \"Total Revenue\" line item. \n\n   - **Total Revenue**: 5565589.48\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**: The required line item here relates to the net cash flow generated from operating activities (which includes revenues and expenses but does not include financing or investing activities).\n\n   - **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -81548.37 (This is a negative cash flow but represents the overall impact of cash generated/lost from operations)\n\nTo summarize the extracted values:\n- Value 1: End amount of Taxes Payable from the Balance Sheet: **278279.50**\n- Value 2: Total Revenue from the Income Statement: **5565589.48**\n- Value 3: Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: **-81548.37**\n\nNow we can format this data in the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '278279.50', 'value2': '5565589.48', 'value3': '-81548.37'} }\n```",
