This indicates that the company has incurred new obligations to pay for goods and services received.\n   - This amount directly ties to the credit purchases made during the period.\n\n3. **Verify against the cash flow statement:**\n   - In the cash flow statement, we see an item:\n     - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 450,000.00\n   - This further confirms that the entity has incurred an additional obligation of 450,000.00 related to credit purchases during the period.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the specific value of the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 450,000.00, which corresponds to the balance reflected under Accounts Payable.\n\nThe final answer in the required format is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '450000.00'} }\n```",
