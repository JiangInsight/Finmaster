In the provided cash flow statement, this specific line item is labeled \"Net Profit.\"\n\nLet's analyze the provided cash flow statement step-by-step:\n\n1. The first section of the cash flow statement is titled \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n2. Within this section, we see an entry for \"Net Profit\" with the associated amount.\n3. The value of the \"Net Profit\" entry is clearly listed as **1095371.35**.\n\nThis amount represents the profit the entity retains after deducting all operating costs, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization from total revenue.\n\nNow, I will format the extracted value into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1095371.35'}}\n```",
