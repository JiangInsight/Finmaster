                        "content": "To extract the specific line items and values of costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers from the given income statement, we need to focus on two main account categories: **Cost of Goods Sold** and **Selling Expenses**.\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** This represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company. It includes the cost of materials and labor directly used to create the product.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses:** This includes costs directly associated with selling the company's products or services, which may encompass expenses related to marketing, advertising, and other costs incurred to secure customer orders.\n\nNow let's analyze the given income statement:\n\n```plaintext\n| Account                    | Amount      | Date        |\n| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| Main Business Revenue      | 5565589.48  | 2024-01-27  |\n| Total Revenue              | 5565589.48  | 2024-01-27  |\n| Cost of Goods Sold         | 3020000.00  | 2024-01-27  |  <--- This is part of costs incurred\n| Total Cost                 | 3020000.00  | 2024-01-27  |\n| Gross Profit               | 2545589.48  | 2024-01-27  |\n| Administrative Expenses     | 278023.19   | 2024-01-27  |\n| Selling Expenses            | 662884.34   | 2024-01-27  |  <--- This is part of costs incurred\n| Depreciation               | 45748.43    | 2024-01-27  |\n| Financial Expenses          | 193875.48   | 2024-01-27  |\n| Total Expenses              | 1180531.44  | 2024-01-27  |\n| Interest Income             | 8592.81     | 2024-01-27  |\n| Profit Before Tax          | 1373650.85  | 2024-01-27  |\n| Tax Expense                | 278279.50   | 2024-01-27  |\n| Net Profit                 | 1095371.35  | 2024-01-27  |\n```\n\nNext, we will sum the values of the costs we identified:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: **3020000.00**\n- Selling Expenses: **662884.34**\n\nNow we calculate the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services:\n\n**Total Costs** = COGS + Selling Expenses\n**Total Costs** = 3020000.00 + 662884.34 = 3682884.34\n\nSo, the total amount associated with the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services is 3682884.34.\n\nFinally, we format this value into the required JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3682884.34'} }\n```",
