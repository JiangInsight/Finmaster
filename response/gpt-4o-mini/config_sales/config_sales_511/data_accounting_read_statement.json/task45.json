The net cash flows identified here do not relate to investing or financing activities.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: \n   - From the statement: \n     - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -81,548.37\n   - This is the principal figure we need for the final \"value\".\n\n2. **Extracting Sub-item Values**: \n   - We need to extract the individual components that make up this net cash flow:\n     - Net Profit: 1,095,371.35\n     - Depreciation: 45,748.43\n     - (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable: -1,502,354.84\n     - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable: -8,592.81\n     - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -440,000.00\n     - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 450,000.00\n     - Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable: 278,279.50\n\n3. **Calculation of Net Cash Flow**:\n   - By summing up these components, we confirm the net cash flow computed as follows:\n     ```\n     Net Cash Flow From Operating Activities = \n     Net Profit + Depreciation + (Decrease in Accounts Receivable) + (Decrease in Interest Receivable) + (Decrease in Inventory) + (Increase in Accounts Payable) + (Increase in Tax Payable)\n\n     = 1,095,371.35 + 45,748.43 - 1,502,354.84 - 8,592.81 - 440,000.00 + 450,000.00 + 278,279.50\n     = -81,548.37\n     ```\n\n### Final Values:\nAfter our breakdown, we summarize the extracted values in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"value\": \"-81548.37\", \n    \"sub_items_sub_item value1\": \"1095371.35\", \n    \"sub_items_sub_item value2\": \"45748.43\", \n    \"sub_items_sub_item value3\": \"-1502354.84\", \n    \"sub_items_sub_item value4\": \"-8592.81\", \n    \"sub_items_sub_item value5\": \"-440000.00\", \n    \"sub_items_sub_item value6\": \"450000.00\", \n    \"sub_items_sub_item value7\": \"278279.50\"\n}}\n```",
