                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate two financial metrics based on the provided financial statements: Free Cash Flow (FCF) and Current Assets Turnover Ratio.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\nFree Cash Flow is calculated with the formula:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} \\]\nWhere:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** is taken from the cash flow statement.\n- **Capital Expenditures** can be derived from the cash flow statement as the **net cash flow from investing activities**, particularly focusing on the purchases of fixed assets.\n\nFrom the provided cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** is **803237.11**.\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets (Capital Expenditures)** is **437464.43**.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[ \\text{FCF} = 803237.11 - 437464.43 = 365772.68 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\nThe Current Assets Turnover Ratio measures how efficiently a company is using its current assets to generate revenue and is calculated with the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} \\]\nWhere:\n- **Total Revenue** is taken from the income statement, which is **5760023.09**.\n- **Average Current Assets** can be calculated by:\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Current Assets} + \\text{Ending Current Assets}}{2} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Beginning Total Current Assets (Initial Amount) is **8000000.00**.\n- Ending Total Current Assets (End Amount) is **10261562.67**.\n\nCalculating average:\n\\[ \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{8000000.00 + 10261562.67}{2} = \\frac{18261562.67}{2} = 9130781.34 \\]\n\nNow using the Average Current Assets in the turnover ratio formula:\n\\[ \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5760023.09}{9130781.34} \\approx 0.6319 \\]\n\n### Final Results\n\nNow we present the results in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '365772.68', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.63'}}\n``` \n\nNote: Itâ€™s important to round the Current Assets Turnover Ratio to two decimal places, so the final value is presented as `0.63`. \n\nTherefore, the final JSON output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '365772.68', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.63'}}\n```",
