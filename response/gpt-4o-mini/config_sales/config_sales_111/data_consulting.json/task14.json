                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we need the following information:\n\n1. **Net Credit Sales**: This is typically the revenue from sales made on credit. From the income statement, we can use the \"Total Revenue\" figure as a proxy for net credit sales, assuming all sales are on credit. In this case, the total revenue is 5760023.09.\n\n2. **Average Accounts Receivable**: This is calculated as the average of the accounts receivable at the start and end of the period. \n\n   - Looking at the balance sheet:\n     - Accounts Receivable at the start (initial amount): 0.00\n     - Accounts Receivable at the end (end amount): 1454443.80\n\n   The formula for Average Accounts Receivable is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0.00 + 1454443.80}{2} = \\frac{1454443.80}{2} = 727221.90\n   \\]\n\n3. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**: This is calculated using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the values we calculated:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5760023.09}{727221.90} \\approx 7.91\n   \\]\n\nNow that we have calculated the **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**, we will present it in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.91'} }\n```",
