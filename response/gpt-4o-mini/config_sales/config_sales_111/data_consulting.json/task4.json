                        "content": "To solve the problem and calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio from the provided balance sheet data, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Total Liabilities and Total Owner's Equity**:\n   - Total Liabilities can be determined by adding **Total Current Liabilities** to any other long-term liabilities. In this case, no long-term liabilities are mentioned, so we will consider **Total Current Liabilities** as Total Liabilities.\n   - Total Ownerâ€™s Equity is given directly in the balance sheet.\n\n2. **Extract the Values**:\n   - From the provided balance sheet:\n     - **Total Current Liabilities** = 1,548,001.20\n     - **Total Owner's Equity** = 14,105,265.77\n\n3. **Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio**:\n   - The Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values we have:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,548,001.20}{14,105,265.77}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   - Calculating the ratio:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} \\approx 0.1095\n     \\]\n\n5. **Format the Result**:\n   - To present the value of the Debt to Equity Ratio with appropriate significant figures, we can round it to two decimal places, resulting in approximately 0.11.\n\nNow, we will represent the final answer in JSON format as instructed:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11'} }\n```",
