The **Net Profit** after all expenses have been deducted, which represents the profit of the entity.\n2. The **Purchase of Fixed Assets**, which is a cash payment to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nNext, let's analyze the cash flow statement step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Line Items\nLooking through the cash flow statement, we can find:\n- **Net Profit**: Listed under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: Listed under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n\n### Step 2: Extract Their Values\n- **Net Profit**: The value is **1105265.77**.\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The value is **437464.43**.\n\n### Step 3: Format the Solution\nWe need to present the extracted values in the specified JSON format with the keys 'value1' and 'value2'. Here, 'value1' corresponds to the net profit, and 'value2' corresponds to the purchase of fixed assets.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1105265.77', 'value2': '437464.43'} }\n```",
