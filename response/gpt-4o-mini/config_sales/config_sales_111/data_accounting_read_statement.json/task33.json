The line item that corresponds to \"income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities\" is the **Main Business Revenue**. The value given for this line item in the income statement is **5760023.09**.\n\n2. The line item that represents the \"carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\" is the **Cost of Goods Sold** (COGS). The value provided for COGS in the income statement is **3140000.00**.\n\nAccording to the output formatting instructions, we should maintain the original line item order. Thus, the first value will be from the **Main Business Revenue**, followed by the value from **Cost of Goods Sold**.\n\nNow, we can represent the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5760023.09', 'value2': '3140000.00'}}\n```",
