It recognizes the wear and tear on the asset over time.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both line items confirm the systematic allocation of depreciation related to fixed assets, and the value is consistent across both statements.\n\nBased on this information, the value of the systematic allocation (depreciation amount) extracted from the financial statements is **45760.13**.\n\n### Final Output:\nThus, the solution in the required format would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45760.13'} }\n```",
