The two specific line items we need to extract are related to funds deposited into a bank and income earned from financial assets.\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - We look for the line item indicating funds deposited into a bank. The relevant line is **Bank Deposits**.\n   - The **End Amount** for Bank Deposits is **3502535.57**.\n   - We also look for any other line items that may be relevant, but for this case, \"Bank Deposits\" is the only one that fits the criteria.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - The line item related to income earned from financial assets is **Interest Income**.\n   - The **Amount** for Interest Income is **11346.19**.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In this case, there are no line items specifically indicating funds deposited into a bank or income earned from financial assets aside from those already noted in the Balance Sheet and Income Statement.\n\nNow we can present the extracted values for the solution:\n\n- Value1 (Bank Deposits End Amount): **3502535.57**\n- Value2 (Interest Income Amount): **11346.19**\n\nWe then format these values according to the required structure in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3502535.57', 'value2': '11346.19'} }\n```",
