The tax information can typically be found in the balance sheet under \"Taxes Payable\" and in the income statement under \"Tax Expense.\"\n\n### Step 2: Extract Tax Information\n1. **From the balance sheet**:\n   - There is a line item labeled \"Taxes Payable\" with a value of `288001.20` (for the end date of 2024-01-28).\n   \n2. **From the income statement**:\n   - There is a line item labeled \"Tax Expense\" with a value of `288001.20` (for the date of 2024-01-28).\n\n### Step 3: Aggregate the Values\nIn this case, both the balance sheet and income statement have the same value for tax-related items, which is `288001.20`.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the Solution\nWe will present the value we extracted in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '288001.20'} }\n```",
