Reviewing the provided cash flow statement, we look for line items under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n2. The relevant line item that indicates changes in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services is: \n   - **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**. This line reflects the change in amounts owed to the entity. A negative value indicates a decrease in accounts receivable, meaning that the entity collected receivables or had less owed to it compared to previous periods.\n3. The line item for **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable** shows an amount of **-1454443.80**.\n4. Since this value is negative, it means there was a decrease in accounts receivable, signifying that amounts owed to the entity have decreased.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the extracted value for the decrease in amounts owed to the entity is -1454443.80.\n\nPutting this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1454443.80'} }\n```",
