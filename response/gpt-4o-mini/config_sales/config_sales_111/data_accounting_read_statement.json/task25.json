For delivery of goods, COGS is a major component.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses**: This includes costs related to marketing and selling the company's products and services, which also contribute to securing customer orders.\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 3140000.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: 793728.19\n\nNow, to determine the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services, we need to sum these two values:\n\nTotal Costs = Cost of Goods Sold + Selling Expenses\nTotal Costs = 3140000.00 + 793728.19\nTotal Costs = 3933728.19\n\nNow we can format this into the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3933728.19'} }\n```",
