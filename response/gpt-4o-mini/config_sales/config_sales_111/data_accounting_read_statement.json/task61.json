Balance Sheet\nWe are looking for:\n- Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment, and other long-term assets.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Fixed Assets** (reflecting overall long-term investment)\n  \nAnalyzing the data:\n- The **End Amount** for Fixed Assets is 5437464.43.\n- This suggests the total value reported for Fixed Assets, but doesn't provide direct information about cash payments in itself.\n\n#### 2. Cash Flow Statement\nWe are looking for:\n- Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.\n- Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 437464.43 reflects cash payments to acquire fixed assets.\n- No other line item directly reflects costs related to customer orders from the cash flow statement.\n\n#### 3. Income Statement\nLooking for:\n- Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 3140000.00 directly represents the cost incurred to deliver goods/services to customers.\n\n### Step 2: Compile the Results\nWe found:\n- From the **Income Statement**: Cost of Goods Sold = 3140000.00 (this represents costs incurred to deliver goods and services).\n- From the **Cash Flow Statement**: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 437464.43 (this indicates cash payments to acquire long-term assets).\n\n### Final Answer\nWe will now present these values in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3140000.00', 'value2': '437464.43'} }\n```",
