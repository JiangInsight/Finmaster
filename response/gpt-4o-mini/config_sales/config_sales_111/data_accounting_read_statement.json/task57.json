Since the initial amount was 0.00, the entire end balance of 1,260,000.00 for the period is new credit extended to the entity.\n\n3. **Check Cash Flow Statement**: We see that there is an 'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable' entry which also confirms this amount:\n   - **Increase in Accounts Payable**: 1,260,000.00\n\n4. **Conclude the Calculation**: The amount owed, as indicated in both the balance sheet and the cash flow statement, is 1,260,000.00.\n\nFinally, we will present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1260000.00'} }\n```",
