Among these, the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" indicates the change in amounts owed to suppliers for goods and services received on credit.\n\n3. In the data provided:\n   - The line for **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** is recorded as **1260000.00**.\n\nThus, the value representing the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is **1260000.00**.\n\nNow, we can format our answer according to the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1260000.00'} }\n```",
