From the section **Cash Flow From Operating Activities**, the relevant line item is:\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: **1260000.00**\n\n2. From the section **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**, we need to look for:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: **437464.43**\n\n3. In the section **Cash and Cash Equivalents**, we identify the beginning balance:\n   - Beginning Balance: **8000000.00**\n\nNow we can compile these values into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1260000.00', 'value2': '437464.43', 'value3': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
