From the **income statement**, the key figure we need to assess is **\"Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\"**. This account generally encompasses the direct costs attributable to producing the goods sold by a company and includes costs related to obtaining customer orders and fulfilling those orders with physical goods.\n\n   - In our data, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is recorded as **3,140,000.00**. \n\n2. Additionally, we may also consider **\"Selling Expenses\"** from the income statement, as these may include costs directly related to securing customer orders, such as marketing, sales staff costs, and promotional expenses.\n\n   - The \"Selling Expenses\" figure here is **793,728.19**.\n\n3. To summarize our findings:\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold: 3,140,000.00**\n   - **Selling Expenses: 793,728.19**\n\nThe total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services would therefore be the combination of these two figures:\n\n   Total Costs = COGS + Selling Expenses  \n   Total Costs = 3,140,000.00 + 793,728.19 = 3,933,728.19\n\nHowever, if the task requests only one specific line item associated directly with delivering goods, then \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) is the key figure we want to report.\n\nGiven that:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3140000.00'}}\n``` \n\nThis value represents the cost directly associated with delivering goods to customers according to the financial statement provided.",
