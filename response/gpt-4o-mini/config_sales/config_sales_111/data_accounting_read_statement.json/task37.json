This line item in financial reports is typically labeled as \"Depreciation.\"\n\nNow let's analyze the provided cash flow statement:\n\n1. We have multiple sections, but we are interested in the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" where depreciation is typically listed.\n2. Under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities,\" we see the following relevant lines:\n   - Net Profit\n   - Depreciation\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n   - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\n3. Among these, the line that stands out as the systematic allocation of the value of an asset is \"Depreciation\" with the amount of 45760.13.\n\nNow, we will extract just the value for the \"Depreciation\" line item:\n\n- Value: 45760.13\n\nFinally, we present our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45760.13'} }\n```",
