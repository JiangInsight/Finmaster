Based on the typical balance sheet format, the relevant entries for tangible assets would be:\n     - Inventory\n     - Fixed Assets\n     - Total Non-current Assets (though this also includes accumulated depreciation)\n\n2. **Extract Values**:\n   - For the identified line items:\n     - **Inventory**: \n       - Initial Amount: 0.00\n       - End Amount: 430000.00\n     - **Fixed Assets**:\n       - Initial Amount: 5000000.00\n       - End Amount: 5437464.43\n\n3. **Calculate Initial and Final Values**: \n   - The tangible items relevant to our extraction here are:\n     - Fixed Assets:\n       - Initial: 5000000.00\n       - End: 5437464.43\n     - Inventory:\n       - Initial: 0.00 (not needed for initial values)\n       - End: 430000.00 (this does add to the total but is less significant compared to the fixed assets.)\n\n4. **Total Values**:\n   - The combined initial value of tangible items is thus:\n     - Total Initial for tangible items = 5000000.00 (Fixed Assets)\n   - The combined end value of tangible items is:\n     - Total End for tangible items = 5437464.43 + 430000.00 = 5867464.43\n\nHowever, since the task only specifies to return specific values, here we will focus on the significant asset (fixed assets). \n\n5. **Final Output**:\n   - The result must be formatted according to the prompt.\n\nSo, the final JSON output reflecting the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5437464.43'}}\n```\nThis reflects the relevant fixed assets only based on the problem statement regarding the tangible items held for uses mentioned.",
