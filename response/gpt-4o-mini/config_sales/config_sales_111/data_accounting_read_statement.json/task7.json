Common items might include:\n   - Accumulated Depreciation (though it's not a direct expense, it represents the expense recognized over time)\n   - Taxes Payable (indicates taxes owed, which reflects earlier expenses)\n   \n   Based on the current data available, Accumulated Depreciation is the only line item that directly indicates an expense recognized.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and Final Values**:\n   - For **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n     - Initial amount: `0.00`\n     - End amount: `45760.13`\n\nUsing these values, I will format the answer per the requested JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45760.13'}}\n```",
