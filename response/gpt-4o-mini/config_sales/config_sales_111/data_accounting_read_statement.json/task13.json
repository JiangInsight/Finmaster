We will exclude these when considering items not meant for sale or consumption.\n   - **Non-current Assets**: This includes fixed assets and accumulated depreciation, which are not realized in the normal operating cycle but are used over the long term.\n   \n3. **Line Items and Their Values**:\n   - **Fixed Assets**:\n     - Initial Amount: 5,000,000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End Amount: 5,437,464.43 (as of 2024-01-28)\n     \n   - **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n     - This reduces the value of fixed assets but is not an asset itself in the sense of being available for sale or consumption.\n     - Initial Amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End Amount: 45,760.13 (as of 2024-01-28). However, this is a contra asset and not counted for asset value.\n\n4. **Total Non-current Assets Calculation**:\n   - Total Non-current Assets = Initial Fixed Assets (5,000,000.00) + Accumulated Depreciation (0.00 at initial) = Only Fixed Assets matter here.\n   - Non-current assets as observed in the balance sheet: \n     - Total Non-current Assets (Initial): 5,000,000.00\n     - Total Non-current Assets (End): 5,391,704.30\n\n5. **Final Consideration**: \n   - Since we only focus on fixed assets for the calculation of total non-current assets:\n   - Initial value of Non-current assets = 5,000,000.00 \n   - End value of Non-current assets = 5,391,704.30\n\n### Conclusion:\nWe are interested only in Fixed Assets for the relevant line items. Thus the extraction is for Non-current Assets values.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5391704.30'}}\n```",
