The relevant columns are Account, Amount, and Date.\n2. We are looking for line items that represent financing costs. In this case, the line item explicitly labeled as \"Financial Expenses\" indicates the costs incurred for financing activities.\n\nFrom the income statement provided:\n\n- **Financial Expenses** is listed with an amount of **112130.48**.\n\nThus, we can conclude that this is the financing cost incurred by the enterprise.\n\nNow, I will present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '112130.48'} }\n```",
