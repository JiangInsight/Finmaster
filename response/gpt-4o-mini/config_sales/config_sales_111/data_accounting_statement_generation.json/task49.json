                        "content": "To create a cash flow statement from the provided transactions, we need to analyze the different types of transactions and how they impact cash flow:\n\n1. **Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\n   - We will start by calculating the net profit based on sales and expenses.\n   - Include depreciation as a non-cash expense that needs to be added back.\n   - Adjust for changes in accounts receivable, interest receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and tax payable.\n\n2. **Cash Flow from Investing Activities:**\n   - This typically involves cash transactions related to the purchase or sale of fixed assets.\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow:** \n   - This is the sum of cash flows from operating and investing activities.\n   - Add the initial cash balance to find the ending cash balance.\n\nLet's carry out the calculations step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Determine Net Profit\n- **Total Sales = 104707.68 + 25578.75 + 25862.64 + 116350.08 + 92066.84 + 38564.61 + 9184.31 + 18310.19 + 70177.82 + 34140.7 + 39223.4 + 104272.98 + 115284.81 + 65378.47 = 882154.2200000001**\n- **Total Expenses = 3623.3 + 20805.83 + 27596.64 + 45760.130000000005 + 441.44 + 3623.3 + 20805.83 + 27596.64 + 45760.130000000005 + 441.44 + 26250.83 + 12164.38 + 11794.37 + 18000.68 + 27231.346 + 21386.451 + 46258.36 = 629318.81**\n- **Net Profit = Total Sales - Total Expenses = 882154.2200000001 - 629318.81 = 252835.41**\n\n### Step 2: Adjust for Non-Cash and Working Capital Changes\n- **Depreciation:** Add back $45760.13.\n- **Change in Accounts Receivable:** Total Accounts Receivable changes need to subtract amounts not received ($24800 + $35800 + $81200 ... = $482000). Therefore, subtract $482000.\n- **Change in Interest Receivable:** (-) $445.21.\n- **Change in Inventory:** Total inventory increase $600000 (from purchases) - amount moved to COGS (sold, $250000) = decrease (-) $350000.\n- **Change in Accounts Payable:** Increase by unpaid purchases ($60000 + $60000 + $30000 + $250000 + $150000 = $50000). Therefore, add $50000.\n- **Change in Tax Payable:** No change indicated so stable.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nPutting all together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit} = 252835.41 + 45760.13 - 482000 - 445.21 - 350000 + 50000\n\\]\n\nThis calculates cash flow from operating activities.\n\n### Step 4: Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- **Total Purchase of Fixed Assets:** $321724.42 + $115740.01.\n- Total Investing Activities = $(321724.42 + 115740.01) = -437464.43.\n\n### Step 5: Overall Cash Flow Calculation\n- Starting cash balance is $8000000.\n- Cash from Operating Activities + Cash from Investing Activities + Beginning Cash gives ending balance.\n\nWe compile our results as follows into the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    'Cash Flow From Operating Activities': '-482000.00', \n    'Net Profit': '252835.41', \n    'Depreciation': '45760.13', \n    '(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-482000.00', \n    '(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-445.21', \n    '(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-350000.00', \n    'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '50000.00', \n    'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '0.00', \n    'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-335990.67', \n    'Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-437464.43', \n    'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '437464.43', \n    'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-437464.43', \n    'Cash and Cash Equivalents': '0.00', \n    'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00', \n    'Ending Balance': '7521545.10', \n    'Net Increase': '-487454.90'} }\n```",
