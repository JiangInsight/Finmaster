Conversely, it decreases when customers pay off their outstanding debts (paid sales).\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Transactions**:\n    - We need to look specifically for transactions denoting sales (both unpaid and paid) to capture the changes in the accounts receivable.\n    - For entries with the status \"Unpaid\", we increment our accounts receivable.\n    - For entries with the status \"Paid\", we decrement our accounts receivable.\n\n3. **Analyzing Transactions**:\n    - We will sum the amounts for all \"Sale\" entries, separating them into two categories: unpaid (which will increase accounts receivable) and paid (which will decrease accounts receivable).\n\n4. **Calculating the Change in Accounts Receivable**:\n   - Extract amounts from:\n     - **Unpaid Sales**: These increase the accounts receivable.\n     - **Paid Sales**: These decrease the accounts receivable.\n   - Since we need the final change in accounts receivable, the formula will be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Increase in A/R} = \\text{Sum of Unpaid Sales} - \\text{Sum of Paid Sales}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute these sums based on the provided data.\n\n### Processing the provided data:\n- **Unpaid Sales** (adding to accounts receivable):\n  - Sale on 2024-01-02: 25862.64\n  - Sale on 2024-01-03: 116350.08\n  - Sale on 2024-01-07: 72420.34\n  - Sale on 2024-01-07: 17299.30\n  - Sale on 2024-01-09: 8585.48\n  - Sale on 2024-01-12: 9056.94\n  - Sale on 2024-01-13: 37955.74\n  - Sale on 2024-01-14: 15125.46\n  - Sale on 2024-01-17: 28908.73\n  - Sale on 2024-01-18: 182159.24\n  - Sale on 2024-01-21: 8657.27\n  - Sale on 2024-01-22: 19669.54\n  - Sale on 2024-01-23: 114947.1\n  - Sale on 2024-01-24: 17284.38\n  - Sale on 2024-01-25: 98695.47\n  - Sale on 2024-01-26: 268474.8\n\nTotal Unpaid Sales = \n\\[\n25862.64 + 116350.08 + 72420.34 + 17299.30 + 8585.48 + 9056.94 + 37955.74 + 11860.42 + 8657.27 + 19669.54 + 114947.1 + 17284.38 + 98695.47 + 268474.8 = 725704.58\n\\]\n\n- **Paid Sales** (subtracting from accounts receivable):\n  - Sale on 2024-01-02: 104707.68\n  - Sale on 2024-01-02: 25578.75\n  - Sale on 2024-01-03: 92066.84\n  - Sale on 2024-01-03: 38564.61\n  - Sale on 2024-01-06: 38390.92\n  - Sale on 2024-01-06: 95027.97\n  - Sale on 2024-01-11: 39223.4\n  - Sale on 2024-01-11: 104272.98\n  - Sale on 2024-01-12: 178308.04\n  - Sale on 2024-01-18: 88728.79\n  - Sale on 2024-01-20: 19830.74\n  - Sale on 2024-01-21: 34140.7\n  - Sale on 2024-01-23: 9369.54\n  - Sale on 2024-01-23: 39865.25\n  - Sale on 2024-01-24: 184902.76\n\nTotal Paid Sales = \n\\[\n104707.68 + 25578.75 + 92066.84 + 38564.61 + 38390.92 + 95027.97 + 39223.4 + 104272.98 + 178308.04 + 88728.79 + 19830.74 + 34140.7 + 9369.54 + 39865.25 + 184902.76 =  909752.46 \n\\]\n\n### Final Calculation:\nNow we can compute the change in accounts receivable (A/R):\n\\[\n\\text{(Increase) Decrease in A/R} = \\text{Total Unpaid Sales} - \\text{Total Paid Sales} = 725704.58 - 909752.46 = -184047.88\n\\]\n\nThe change in accounts receivable is thus a net decrease of approximately $184047.88.\n\nThe final output will be in the specified format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-184047.88'}} \n```",
