The transactions will generally include:\n   - Cash deposits increase the bank account balance.\n   - Purchases made through bank transfer reduce this balance.\n   - Sales that occur can increase the deposit if paid via cash or bank transfer.\n\n3. **Calculate the Final Bank Deposit Value**: We sum all transactions affecting these deposits to get the final value.\n\nNow, let's go through the transactions systematically:\n\n### Initialization for Bank Deposits\nFrom the provided transactions:\n\n- The **Initial Bank Deposit Value** as of `2023-12-31` is `5,000,000.00`.\n\n### Analyzing Transactions\n\nNext, we will analyze the subsequent transactions that affect bank deposits:\n\n- **Cash Deposits**: None mentioned post-initial value.\n  \n- **Purchases Paid via Bank Transfer**:\n    - `Purchase20231231006` amount is `500,000.0` (Paid).\n    - `Purchase20231231007` amount is `70,000.0` (Paid).\n    - `Purchase20231231008` amount is `200,000.0` (Paid).\n    - `Purchase20231231020` amount is `250,000.0` (Paid).\n    - `Purchase20231231015` amount is `180,000.0` (Paid).\n  \n  The total amount deducted for purchases is:\n  \\[\n   500,000 + 70,000 + 200,000 + 250,000 + 180,000 = 1,200,000\n  \\]\n\n- **Sales Transactions**:\n  We focus only on those that are marked as \"Paid\" and involve bank transfers or cash:\n  \n    - `Sale20240102003` amount is `104,707.68` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240102004` amount is `25,578.75` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240103009` amount is `92,066.84` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240103010` amount is `38,564.61` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240111040` amount is `39,223.4` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240111041` amount is `104,272.98` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240112044` amount is `178,308.04` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240112001` amount is `18,806.62` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240115056` amount is `17,622.36` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240115057` amount is `68,815.0` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240115058` amount is `18,852.77` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240116061` amount is `36,507.61` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240116062` amount is `113,277.99` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240117063` amount is `284,707.14` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240117064` amount is `104,527.53` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240117065` amount is `38,960.69` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240119074` amount is `35,690.12` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240119075` amount is `71,523.06` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240120079` amount is `19,830.74` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240120081` amount is `26,980.47` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240122088` amount is `85,414.29` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240122089` amount is `93,377.7` (Paid).\n    - `Sale20240124101` amount is `184,902.76` (Paid).\n\nSumming these paid amounts gives:\n\\[\n  104,707.68 + 25,578.75 + 92,066.84 + 38,564.61 + 39,223.4 + 104,272.98 + 178,308.04 + 18806.62 + 17,622.36 + 68,815.0 + 18,852.77 + 36,507.61 + 113,277.99 + 284,707.14 + 104,527.53 + 38,960.69 + 35,690.12 + 71,523.06 + 19,830.74 + 26,980.47 + 85,414.29 + 93,377.7 + 184,902.76 =  1,213,460.66\n\\]\n\n### Final Calculation\nNow, subtract the total purchases and add the total sales:\n- Final Bank Deposit Value = Initial Value + Total Sales - Total Purchases\n\\[\n\\text{Final Value} = 5,000,000 + 1,213,460.66 - 1,200,000 = 5,013,460.66 \n\\]\n\n### Summary\nThe required solution in the specified format is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Bank Deposits Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Bank Deposits End Value': '5013460.66'} }\n```",
