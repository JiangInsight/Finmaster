These typically include sales transactions (where tax is applied on revenue) and purchases that can affect tax deductions.\n\n2. **Compute Tax Amounts:** For each sale, we'll add the tax amounts that will increase tax liabilities. For purchases, we'll deduct tax amounts that can decrease tax liabilities.\n\n3. **Keep Track of Values:**\n    - **Tax from Sales**: Summing up the `tax_amount` from sale entries adds to the total tax liability.\n    - **Tax from Purchases**: Summing up the `tax_amount` from purchase entries reduces the total tax liability.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:** After gathering all the tax amounts from sales and purchases, we'll compute the difference to determine the net change in tax payable.\n\nNow, let's compute based on the transactions from your input:\n\n**Relevant Transactions:**\n- **Sales Transactions**\n    -
