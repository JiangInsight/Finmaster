For the purpose of this task, we round this value to two decimal places for conventional financial reporting.\n\n4. **Format Result**:\n   Now, the required output for the depreciation needs to be formatted as per the specified JSON structure.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the following solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45760.13'} }\n``` \n\nThis indicates the final depreciation amount represented in the final income statement.",
