                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio, we need to identify the total liabilities and total assets from the provided balance sheet data.\n\n1. **Identify Total Assets**:\n   From the balance sheet problem, the reported value for Total Assets is provided as:\n   ```\n   Total Assets = 15200446.16\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Total Liabilities**:\n   We can find Total Liabilities by summing the Current Liabilities:\n   - Accounts Payable: 1240000.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 253246.99\n   \n   Thus, Total Current Liabilities will be calculated as follows:\n   ```\n   Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable\n                            = 1240000.00 + 253246.99\n                            = 1493246.99\n   ```\n\n3. **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity**:\n   Since we want the total liabilities for the calculations, it's clear that:\n   - In this problem context, Total Liabilities is equal to Total Current Liabilities, as we have not been given any long-term liabilities.\n\n4. **Calculate Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   The Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n   ```\n   Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n   ```\n\n   Plugging in our values:\n   ```\n   Debt to Asset Ratio = 1493246.99 / 15200446.16\n                        ≈ 0.0981\n   ```\n\n5. **Format the Ratio**:\n   To match the given specification, we will round the ratio to two decimal places and convert it to a string format. Thus:\n   ```\n   Debt to Asset Ratio ≈ 0.10\n   ```\n\nNow, we can present our answer in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10'}}\n```",
