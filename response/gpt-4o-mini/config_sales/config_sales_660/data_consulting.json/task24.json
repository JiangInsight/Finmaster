                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio, we'll need to extract numbers from the given three financial statements: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Debt and Total Assets\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Assets: `15200446.16`\n- Total Current Liabilities (part of total debt): `1493246.99`\n\nSince we don't have information about long-term liabilities, we assume Total Current Liabilities represents Total Debt in this context for the calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nThe formula for Debt to Asset Ratio is:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{1493246.99}{15200446.16} \\approx 0.0981\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Operating Cash Flow from the Cash Flow Statement\n\n**From the Cash Flow Statement:**\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: `-64099.10`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Net Income from the Income Statement\n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Net Profit (Net Income): `707199.17`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThe formula for Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-64099.10}{707199.17} \\approx -0.0906\n\\]\n\n### Final Step: Formatting the Output\n\nFollowing the calculations, we'll provide the values formatted according to the specified JSON format. As we've obtained the Debt to Asset Ratio as approximately 0.0981 and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio as approximately -0.0906.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.10', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.09'}}\n```",
