                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: This figure is noted in the cash flow statement. Specifically, we are interested in the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\".\n\n2. **Calculate Total Debt**: The Total Debt will generally consist of Total Liabilities. We can find Total Liabilities by examining the balance sheet, looking for current liabilities and non-current liabilities.\n\n3. **Compute Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: The formula is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 1: Identify Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, we find:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -64099.10\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Debt\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Accounts Payable**: 1240000.00\n- **Taxes Payable**: 253246.99\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 1493246.99 (this figure already sums up Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable)\n\nSince there are no notes or long-term debts mentioned in the balance sheet, we can conclude that the **Total Liabilities** = **Total Debt** = **Total Current Liabilities** = 1493246.99.\n\n### Step 3: Compute Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-64099.10}{1493246.99}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this value:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} \\approx -0.04295\n\\]\n\nConverting to a more interpretable ratio by rounding:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} \\approx -0.043\n\\]\n\nSince itâ€™s common to express this rounded ratio in two decimal places for financial analyses:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} \\approx -0.04\n\\]\n\n### Final Result \n\nLet's structure the final result in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.04'}}\n```",
