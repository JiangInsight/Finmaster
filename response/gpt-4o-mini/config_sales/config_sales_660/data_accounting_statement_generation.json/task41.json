Therefore, we do not subtract anything for paid transactions in this instance as they are already settled and do not factor into the change for the current accounts payable status.\n\n### Final Calculation:\n\nTotal Increase in Accounts Payable = 1095000.00\n\n### Final Answer in Required Format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '1095000.00'} }\n```",
