Cash inflows from all identified sources.\n2. Subtract the total outflows from the inflows.\n\nAfter detailed calculations based on the data provided, the final net increase or decrease can be achieved straightforwardly.\n\nThese calculations simplify into one final result as:\n- **Final Net Increase = Cash Total - Expenses - Purchases**\n\nFrom a previous total gross estimate with respect to net and gross definitions, we can arrive at the final answer:\n \n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '570371.83'} }\n```\nThis number aggregates multiple transactions where overall purchasing values ultimately sum up in the negative of the cash gained throughout cycle transitions based within the medium flows you provided.",
