The tax amounts from sales and purchases will determine the tax payable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Sales Transactions**:\n   We will sum up the `tax_amount` calculated from the sales transactions. These amounts represent the tax collected that needs to be paid to tax authorities.\n\n2. **Identify Purchase Transactions**:\n   We will also sum up the `tax_amount` from purchase transactions. These amounts represent the tax paid on purchases which can be deducted from the total tax payable.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Tax from Sales**:\n   We will sum the `tax_amount` from all sales records.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Tax from Purchases**:\n   We will sum the `tax_amount` from all purchase records.\n\n5. **Calculate Final Tax Payable**:\n   The final tax payable will be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Tax Payable} = \\text{Total Tax from Sales} - \\text{Total Tax from Purchases}\n   \\]\n\n### Perform Calculations:\n\n- **Sales Tax Calculation**:\n  \n  Sales:\n  - Sale20240102003: Tax = 5271.39\n  - Sale20240102004: Tax = 3653.32\n  - Sale20240103007: Tax = 495.96\n  - Sale20240103008: Tax = 1937.95\n  - Sale20240103009: Tax = 1987.52\n  - Sale20240103010: Tax = 1949.85\n  - Sale20240104012: Tax = 3522.82\n  - Sale20240104013: Tax = 1842.86\n  - Sale20240105015: Tax = 3546.3\n  - Sale20240105016: Tax = 8744.18\n  - Sale20240105017: Tax = 1839.57\n  - Sale20240108025: Tax = 13569.1\n  - Sale20240108026: Tax = 1887.68\n  - Sale20240108027: Tax = 1886.87\n  - Sale20240108028: Tax = 992.74\n  - Sale20240109031: Tax = 466.83\n  - Sale20240110034: Tax = 2995.7\n  - Sale20240110035: Tax = 872.42\n  - Sale20240111037: Tax = 4418.7\n  - Sale20240112038: Tax = 8921.84\n  - Sale20240112039: Tax = 974.41\n  - Sale20240112040: Tax = 5294.57\n  - Sale20240112041: Tax = 1908.2\n  - Sale20240121077: Tax = 1821.06\n  - Sale20240121078: Tax = 13871.07\n  - Sale20240121079: Tax = 1280.92\n  - Sale20240121080: Tax = 2866.87\n  - Sale20240122083: Tax = 9977.03\n  - Sale20240122084: Tax = 993.01\n  - Sale20240122085: Tax = 4784.53\n  - Sale20240123087: Tax = 972.04\n  - Sale20240123088: Tax = 994.92\n  - Sale20240123089: Tax = 3810.53\n  - Sale20240123090: Tax = 3999.01\n  - Sale20240125097: Tax = 13429.76\n  - Sale20240126099: Tax = 989.05\n  - Sale20240126100: Tax = 932.32\n  - Sale20240127102: Tax = 3719.35\n  - Sale20240127103: Tax = 3800.08\n  - Sale20240127104: Tax = 5260.85\n\n  Total Sales Tax = \\(5271.39 + 3653.32 + 495.96 + 1937.95 + 1987.52 + 1949.85 + 3522.82 + 1842.86 + 3546.3 + 8744.18 + 1839.57 + 13569.1 + 1887.68 + 1886.87 + 992.74 + 466.83 + 2995.7 + 872.42 + 4418.7 + 8921.84 + 974.41 + 5294.57 + 1908.2 + 1821.06 + 13871.07 + 1280.92 + 2866.87 + 9977.03 + 993.01 + 4784.53 + 972.04 + 994.92 + 3810.53 + 3999.01 + 13429.76 + 989.05 + 932.32 + 3719.35 + 3800.08 + 5260.85\\)\n\n  \\(= 114882.73\\)\n\n- **Purchases Tax Calculation**:\n  \n  Purchases:\n  - Purchase20231231001: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231002: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231003: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231004: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231005: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231006: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231007: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231008: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231009: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231010: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231011: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231012: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231013: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231014: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231015: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231016: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231017: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231018: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231019: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231020: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231021: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231022: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231023: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231024: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231025: Tax = 0\n  - Purchase20231231026: Tax = 0\n\n  Total Purchases Tax = 0\n\n### Calculate Final Tax Payable:\n\nFinal Tax Payable = Total Sales Tax - Total Purchases Tax\n= \\( 114882.73 - 0 = 114882.73\\)\n\n### Present the Answer:\n\nBased on the above calculation, the final amount to be stated would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '114882.73'}}\n```",
