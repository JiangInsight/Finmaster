The relevant entries are those marked with \"Unpaid\".\n\nBased on the transactions provided:\n\n1. Purchase on 2023-12-31 for **140,000.00**, payment status **Unpaid**.\n2. Purchase on 2023-12-31 for **40,000.00**, payment status **Unpaid**.\n3. Purchase on 2023-12-31 for **50,000.00**, payment status **Unpaid**.\n4. Purchase on 2023-12-31 for **70,000.00**, payment status **Unpaid**.\n5. Purchase on 2023-12-31 for **60,000.00**, payment status **Unpaid**.\n\nCalculating the total amount of these unpaid liabilities:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities End Value = 140,000.00 + 40,000.00 + 50,000.00 + 70,000.00 + 60,000.00 \n= **360,000.00**\n\n**Step 3: Present the final results**\n\nNow, we can compile our findings into the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '360000.00'}}\n```",
