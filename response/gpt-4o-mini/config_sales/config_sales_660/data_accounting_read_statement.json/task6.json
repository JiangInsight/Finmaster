Common line items that fit this description include \"Inventory\" and \"Fixed Assets\". \n\n1. **Identifying Tangible Items:**\n   - **Fixed Assets**: Refers to long-term tangible assets used in the operations of the business, often including equipment, buildings, etc.\n   - **Inventory**: Refers to goods available for sale or raw materials to be used in production.\n\n2. **Extracting Initial and End Values:**\n   - **Fixed Assets**:\n     - Initial Amount: **5000000.00**\n     - End Amount: **5528936.17**\n   - **Inventory**:\n     - Initial Amount: **0.00**\n     - End Amount: **450000.00**\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Value for Tangible Assets:**\n   - Total tangible items consist of Fixed Assets and Inventory. \n   - The initial value of tangible items: \n     - Fixed Assets: 5000000.00\n     - Inventory: 0.00\n     - Thus, initial value = 5000000.00 + 0.00 = **5000000.00**\n   - The end value of tangible items:\n     - Fixed Assets: 5528936.17\n     - Inventory: 450000.00\n     - Thus, end value = 5528936.17 + 450000.00 = **5978936.17**\n\n4. **Final Representation:**\n   - Though one might consider not to count \"Inventory\" since its initial value is zero, it is still a tangible asset, hence will contribute to the total end value.\n\nFinally, we can frame our solution as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5978936.17'}}\n```",
