Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit (Accounts Receivable).\n2. Financing costs incurred by the enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation (Financial Expenses).\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets (Purchase of Fixed Assets).\n\nI will categorize these extracted values based on the provided order of financial statements: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extracting amounts from the Balance Sheet**\n- Accounts Receivable: This represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit. \n  - **Value1 (Accounts Receivable)** = 1851327.29.\n\n**Step 2: Extracting amounts from the Income Statement**\n- Financial Expenses: These are costs incurred for financing. \n  - **Value2 (Financial Expenses)** = 226258.90.\n\n**Step 3: Extracting amounts from the Cash Flow Statement**\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: This reflects cash payments to acquire long-term assets.\n  - **Value3 (Purchase of Fixed Assets)** = 528936.17.\n\nNow that we've identified the relevant values, I will compile them into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1851327.29', 'value2': '226258.90', 'value3': '528936.17'} }\n```",
