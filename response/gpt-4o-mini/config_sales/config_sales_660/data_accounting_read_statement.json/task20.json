                        "content": "To solve the task of extracting the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period based on the provided income statement, we need to identify the relevant line item associated with inventories sold.\n\nIn the income statement, the line item that typically indicates the cost associated with the goods that have been sold is labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS). This line item represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company, which includes the cost of the inventory that was sold during the reporting period.\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided income statement:\n\n```\n| Account                   | Amount      | Date        |\n| ------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| Main Business Revenue     | 5064939.23  | 2024-01-29  |\n| Total Revenue             | 5064939.23  | 2024-01-29  |\n| Cost of Goods Sold        | 2735000.00  | 2024-01-29  |\n| Total Cost                | 2735000.00  | 2024-01-29  |\n| Gross Profit              | 2329939.23  | 2024-01-29  |\n| Administrative Expenses    | 250651.94   | 2024-01-29  |\n| Selling Expenses          | 855800.20   | 2024-01-29  |\n| Depreciation             | 45749.47    | 2024-01-29  |\n| Financial Expenses        | 226258.90   | 2024-01-29  |\n| Total Expenses            | 1378460.51  | 2024-01-29  |\n| Interest Income           | 8967.44     | 2024-01-29  |\n| Profit Before Tax         | 960446.16   | 2024-01-29  |\n| Tax Expense               | 253246.99   | 2024-01-29  |\n| Net Profit                | 707199.17   | 2024-01-29  |\n```\n\nThe line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" has an amount of 2735000.00. This value represents the carrying amount of inventories that were sold during the reporting period.\n\nBased on this analysis, the solution to the task can be presented in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2735000.00'} }\n```",
