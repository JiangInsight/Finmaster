Looking at the provided balance sheet, we focus on the liabilities section, specifically:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**: Amount owed for goods/services received on credit.\n2. **Taxes Payable**: This can imply amounts owed for taxes, but isn't directly related to goods/services purchased on credit.\n\nFor this specific task, we only focus on the **Accounts Payable** line item since it explicitly represents amounts owed for goods/services received on credit.\n\nWe will now extract the initial and end values for the **Accounts Payable** line item:\n\n- **Initial_amount**: 0.00 (on 2023-12-31)\n- **End_amount**: 1240000.00 (on 2024-01-29)\n\nNow we can format this information according to the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1240000.00'}}\n```",
