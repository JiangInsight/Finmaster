Depreciation represents this systematic allocation.\n\nHere are the relevant sections to analyze:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - The balance sheet includes a line item \"Accumulated Depreciation\" with a value of 45749.47. However, this does not represent the systematic allocation for the current period; it's the total accumulated amount up to that point.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The cash flow statement includes a line for \"Depreciation\" with a value of 45749.47. This represents the depreciation expense in the context of cash flow.\n\n3. **Income Statement**:\n   - The income statement also has a line item \"Depreciation\" with a value of 45749.47. This shows the total depreciation recognized as an expense for the period.\n\nGiven that all references to depreciation across the statements point to the same value of 45749.47, we can conclude that this is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount over its useful life for the current reporting period.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45749.47'} }\n```",
