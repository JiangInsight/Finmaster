Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services to customers - typically represented as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the Income Statement.\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment, and other long-term assets - typically represented as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\nNow, letâ€™s extract these values step by step from each respective financial statement.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Income Statement\nIn the Income Statement, we need the cost incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services, which is:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 2735000.00\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Cash Flow Statement\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, we need the cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment, which is:\n\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 528936.17\n\n### Step 3: Compile the Results\nBased on the analyzed data:\n\n- From the Income Statement, the identified value is \"2735000.00\" for Cost of Goods Sold.\n- From the Cash Flow Statement, the identified value is \"528936.17\" for Purchase of Fixed Assets.\n\n### Final Output:\nNow we can format the output as required.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2735000.00', 'value2': '528936.17'}}\n```",
