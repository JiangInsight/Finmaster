In this case, we should look at \"Fixed Assets\" and any related items.\n\nLet's analyze the balance sheet:\n\n1. **Cash on Hand** - This is a current asset and can be realized in the operating cycle.\n2. **Bank Deposits** - Current asset as well.\n3. **Interest Receivable** - Current asset.\n4. **Accounts Receivable** - Current asset.\n5. **Inventory** - Current asset.\n6. **Total Current Assets** - Summation of the above, hence a current asset.\n7. **Fixed Assets** - These are long-term assets; they are not expected to be realized in the normal course of the entity's operations and thus qualify as non-current assets.\n8. **Accumulated Depreciation** - This is a contra asset account related to fixed assets but does not represent an asset itself.\n9. **Total Non-current Assets** - This includes fixed assets, which is our focus.\n10. **Total Assets** - Overall total but not specific to non-current.\n\nFocusing primarily on \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Total Non-current Assets\", we find:\n\n- **Fixed Assets**:\n  - Initial amount = 5000000.00\n  - End amount = 5528936.17\n\n- **Total Non-current Assets**:\n  - Initial amount = 5000000.00\n  - End amount = 5483186.70\n\nFor the solution, we will select the “Fixed Assets” as it represents the specific non-current assets that are not expected to be realized in the operating cycle. Therefore, we will present the initial and end values for \"Fixed Assets\".\n\nHere is the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5528936.17'}}\n```",
