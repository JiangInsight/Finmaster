The four specific line items we need to find are:\n\n1. The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life (Depreciation).\n2. The reduction in the amount of assets held for sale or in production for sale (which here indicates an increase or decrease in Inventory).\n3. The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities).\n4. The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period (Net Increase).\n\nNow, I'll examine the provided cash flow statement to find the corresponding values. Let's list them out:\n\n1. **Depreciation**: 45749.47\n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: -450000.00\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: -528936.17\n4. **Net Increase**: -593035.27\n\nWe will place these values into the formatted JSON as per the requirement.\n\nHere's the resulting JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '45749.47', 'value2': '-450000.00', 'value3': '-528936.17', 'value4': '-593035.27'} }\n```",
