This includes the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver the goods.\n- **Selling Expenses**: This typically includes costs related to selling, such as advertising, sales commissions, and shipping costs associated with fulfilling customer orders.\n\nFor the solution to specifically identify costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods and services:\n1. The **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** directly reflects the costs to produce and sell the goods, which aligns with delivering the goods to customers.\n2. The **Selling Expenses** may also be counted as they relate to obtaining customer orders.\n\nBy inspecting the income statement, we see:\n- Cost of Goods Sold: **2735000.00**\n- Selling Expenses: **855800.20**\n\nThe **Selling Expenses** can be interpreted as costs related to securing orders directly, but the most direct reflection of delivery costs in the financial statements appears under **Cost of Goods Sold**.\n\nThus, the most appropriate value to extract for the task is **Cost of Goods Sold**: 2735000.00, as it directly correlates to the costs incurred to deliver goods and services to customers.\n\nThus, the answer formatted in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2735000.00'} }\n```",
