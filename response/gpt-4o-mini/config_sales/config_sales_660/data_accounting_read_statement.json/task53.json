This indicates the value of inventory held at the end of this reporting period.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The cash flow statement indicates a line item: \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with an amount of -450,000.00. This implies that inventory decreased by 450,000 during the period. This is indicative of inventory being sold out.\n\n3. **Income Statement**:\n   - The income statement provides a \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) of 2,735,000.00 for the same reporting period. This represents the cost of inventories that were sold during the period. \n\nTo ascertain the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, we can directly take the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" value because it captures the costs associated with inventory that has been sold.\n\nThus, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is **2,735,000.00**.\n\nNow, formatting this into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2735000.00'} }\n```",
