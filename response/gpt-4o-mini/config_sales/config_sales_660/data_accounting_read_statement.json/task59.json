We will follow the order of financial statements as directed: first the Balance Sheet, then the Income Statement, and lastly the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n1. **Balance Sheet Analysis**:\n   - The relevant line item for interest accrued but not yet received is \"Interest Receivable\".\n   - From the balance sheet, the end value of \"Interest Receivable\" is **8967.44**.\n  \n2. **Income Statement Analysis**:\n   - The relevant line item for interest income (which represents the interest accrued but not yet received) is \"Interest Income\".\n   - From the income statement, the amount for \"Interest Income\" is also **8967.44**.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement Analysis**:\n   - The relevant line item for the net increase in cash and cash equivalents is \"Net Increase\".\n   - From the cash flow statement, the \"Net Increase\" value is **-593035.27**.\n\nWe will summarize our findings:\n- **Interest accrued but not yet received** (measured as \"Interest Receivable\"): **8967.44**\n- **Net increase in cash and cash equivalents** (measured as \"Net Increase\"): **-593035.27**\n\nNow we will format this in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '8967.44', 'value2': '-593035.27'} }\n```",
