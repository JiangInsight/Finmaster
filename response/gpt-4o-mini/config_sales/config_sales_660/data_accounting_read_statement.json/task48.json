In the dataset, this amount is:\n\n   - Net Profit: **707199.17**\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This line item relates to the cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets. In the dataset, the amount for this item is:\n\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: **528936.17**\n\nNow, we will present our solution in the required JSON format, maintaining the original order as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '707199.17', 'value2': '528936.17'}}\n```",
