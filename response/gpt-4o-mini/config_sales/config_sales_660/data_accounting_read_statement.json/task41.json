An important part of this statement is recognizing any increases in liabilities, such as tax payables, which represents taxes owed but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Review the Provided Data**: The given problem contains a cash flow statement structured in a tabular format. We need to look for the line item that reflects the increase (or decrease) in tax payable.\n\n3. **Find the Relevant Line Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, we see the line:\n   ```\n   | Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 253246.99 | 2024-01-29 |\n   ```\n   This line indicates an increase in tax payable, meaning there is an increase in the amount of tax accrued but not yet paid.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The amount associated with this line item is `253246.99`.\n\n5. **Format the Solution**: The solution needs to be presented in a specific JSON format with the extracted value.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final solution will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '253246.99'} }\n```",
