                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to extract the line item from the cash flow statement that represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, which is typically indicated as \"Depreciation.\"\n\nLet's follow the steps:\n\n1. Examine the cash flow statement provided in the problem.\n2. Identify the section that discusses cash flow from operating activities.\n3. Look for the specific line item labeled \"Depreciation.\"\n4. Extract the value associated with depreciation.\n\nLet's analyze the cash flow statement:\n\n```\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Profit  | 707199.17 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Depreciation  | 45749.47 | 2024-01-29 |   <--- This is the line item we need\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -1851327.29 | 2024-01-29 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -8967.44 | 2024-01-29 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -450000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 1240000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 253246.99 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -64099.10 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 528936.17 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -528936.17 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Ending Balance  | 7406964.73 | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Increase  | -593035.27 | 2024-01-29 |\n```\n\nWe can see that the line item for \"Depreciation\" shows a value of **45749.47**.\n\nNow, we will format our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45749.47'}}\n```",
