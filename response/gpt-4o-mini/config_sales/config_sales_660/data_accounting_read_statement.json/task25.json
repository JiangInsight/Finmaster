In this instance, it is:\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: 2735000.00\n\n2. **Selling Expenses** - These are expenses incurred to promote and sell products or services. This generally includes costs related to sales staff salaries, advertising, and other sales-related activities. Here, it is:\n   - Selling Expenses: 855800.20\n\nNow, we need to sum these costs to get the total cost incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers.\n\nTotal Cost:\n- COGS: 2735000.00\n- Selling Expenses: 855800.20\n\nCalculating the total:\nTotal Cost = COGS + Selling Expenses \nTotal Cost = 2735000.00 + 855800.20 \nTotal Cost = 3590800.20\n\nOur final extraction, based on the income statement provided, must focus on these calculated values.\n\nNow let's format this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3590800.20'} }\n```",
