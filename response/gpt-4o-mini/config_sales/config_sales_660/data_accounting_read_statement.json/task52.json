The accounts typically include \"Paid-in Capital\" and may also include components of \"Total Owner's Equity\".\n\n2. **Extract Initial and Final Values**:\n   - The relevant line item in this case is **Paid-in Capital**:\n     - **Initial Value**: 13000000.00\n     - **End Value**: 13000000.00\n\n3. **Verification**: \n   - Check if there are any changes in the Paid-in Capital: In this case, both the initial and ending amounts are the same, indicating no changes in capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares during this period.\n\n4. **Construct the Solution**:\n   - Flatten the information into the required JSON format, noting both initial and end values.\n\nHere's the final structured solution in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
