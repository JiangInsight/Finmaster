Here we have only one related sub-item, which is:\n   - \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"\n\n5. **Final Value for Sub-Items**: \n   - The value of the sub-item is **528936.17**.\n\n6. **Formulating the Output**: \n   - Now we format this information into the required JSON structure.\n\nFinal result:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-528936.17', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '528936.17'} }\n```",
