We will mainly look at the \"Accounts Payable\" entry from the balance sheet and the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" entry from the cash flow statement to determine these amounts.\n\nHereâ€™s the breakdown of the data:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet Analysis**:\n   - The line item \"Accounts Payable\" indicates the amount owed by the entity at the end of the reporting period (January 29, 2024).\n   - From the provided balance sheet, the \"Accounts Payable\" shows a value of **1,240,000.00** as of January 29, 2024. This implies that this is the amount owed for goods or services received.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement Analysis**:\n   - The cash flow statement indicates an \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" of **1,240,000.00**. This figure shows how much the accounts payable has increased during the period, indicating that the entity purchased additional goods or services on credit.\n\nIn summary, both the balance sheet and cash flow statement corroborate that the addition to the account due to goods or services received on credit during this particular period is as follows:\n- Total amount increase in \"Accounts Payable\" = **1,240,000.00**.\n\nBased on these findings, we can construct the final answer in the required format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1240000.00'} }\n```",
