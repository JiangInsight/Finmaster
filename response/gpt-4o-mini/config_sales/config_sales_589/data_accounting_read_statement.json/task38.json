This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Receivable\" line item.\n\nHereâ€™s how to analyze the provided cash flow statement step by step:\n\n1. **Locate the Relevant Section**: We check the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section for entries related to accounts receivable, which indicates amounts owed for credit sales.\n\n2. **Find the Specific Line Item**: \n   - The line item we are interested in is **\"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"**\n\n3. **Identify the Value**: \n   - In the provided cash flow statement:\n     - **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable = -1562598.26**\n\n4. **Interpret the Result**: \n   - The negative sign in the amount indicates a decrease in accounts receivable, which corresponds to cash collections from customers. This is the value we need to report.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period is **-1562598.26**.\n\nNow, we will present the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1562598.26'} }\n```",
