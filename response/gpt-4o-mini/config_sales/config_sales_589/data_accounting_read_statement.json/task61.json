Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers.\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Financial Statements\n\n#### Balance Sheet\n1. There are no specific line items for costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods in the Balance Sheet.\n2. However, we do see the \"Fixed Assets\" line, which may relate to property, plant, and equipment.\n\n#### Income Statement\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This line item is directly related to costs incurred to deliver goods and services to customers, making it our **value1**. The amount is **3085000.00**.\n2. The other expenses, such as Administrative and Selling, do not directly relate to the costs specified, as they are broader operational costs.\n\n#### Cash Flow Statement\n1. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This line item is relevant for cash payments to acquire property and equipment. It is our **value2**, with an amount of **106218.20**.\n\n### Step 2: Organize Extracted Values\nThe values which we have extracted are:\n- value1 = Cost of Goods Sold = **3085000.00** (Income Statement)\n- value2 = Purchase of Fixed Assets = **106218.20** (Cash Flow Statement)\n\n### Step 3: Format the Response\nNow we will format the extracted values into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3085000.00', 'value2': '106218.20'} }\n```",
