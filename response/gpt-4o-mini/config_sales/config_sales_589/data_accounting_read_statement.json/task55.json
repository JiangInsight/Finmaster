This indicates the tax liability at the end of the period.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - Within this sheet, there's a line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" of **284755.77**. This entry indicates how taxes payable have changed as a result of operations in the reporting period.\n\n3. **Income Statement**:\n   - Here, we find \"Tax Expense\" listed as **284755.77**. This indicates the tax expense for the given period.\n\nBased on these observations, we see that the amount of tax that is expected to be paid during the reporting period is consistently shown as **284755.77** across the different financial statements.\n\nNow, since we found the same value across the relevant sections, we can confidently state that the total amount of tax the entity expects to pay or recover during the reporting period is **284755.77**.\n\nNow, we can format our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '284755.77'} }\n```",
