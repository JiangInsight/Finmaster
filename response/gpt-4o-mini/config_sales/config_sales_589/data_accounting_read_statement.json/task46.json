This usually falls under \"Investing Activities.\"\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant sections:**\n   - The section titled **\"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\"** contains relevant information about the acquisition of fixed assets.\n\n2. **Extract the cash flow values:**\n   - In this case, we see the following entry under `Cash Flow from Investing Activities`:\n     - **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 106218.20\n   - This is a cash outflow, which means it is decreasing our cash.\n\n3. **Calculate the net amount for cash flow from investing:**\n   - Since the only entry in investing activities relates to the purchase (which is a cash outflow), the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities** is:\n     - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -106218.20 (calculated from the purchase of fixed assets).\n\n4. **Neither Interest nor Dividends were mentioned in any entries, which leaves us with only the relevant line item (Purchase of Fixed Assets).**\n   - Therefore, there are no additional components stemming from interest or dividends.\n\n5. **Present the findings in the required JSON format.**\n   - The total cash flow is a negative value indicating a cash outflow, and the sub-item (purchase of fixed assets) reflects that cash outflow.\n\nHere is the JSON output for the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-106218.20', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '106218.20'}}\n```",
