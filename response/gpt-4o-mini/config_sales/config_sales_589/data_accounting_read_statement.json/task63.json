We can take either; however, Main Business Revenue is typically used for specific business income.\n  \n### Step 3: Extracting from the Cash Flow Statement\nFinally, we need the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities that are not investing or financing, which typically refers to the cash generated from operating activities.\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: From the cash flow statement, it is reported as **-224133.22**. Since this is a negative value, it indicates a cash outflow, but we still capture this as the required value.\n\n### Combining the Values\nNow we combine these extracted values according to the specification:\n1. From the balance sheet: **Taxes Payable** = **284755.77**\n2. From the income statement: **Main Business Revenue** = **5695115.02**\n3. From the cash flow statement: **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** = **-224133.22**\n\n### Final JSON Output\nWe need to format these values into the required JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '284755.77', 'value2': '5695115.02', 'value3': '-224133.22'} }\n```",
