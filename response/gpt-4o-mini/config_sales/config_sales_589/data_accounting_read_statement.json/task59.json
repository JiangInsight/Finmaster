We will take the \"End_amount\" from the balance sheet for \"Interest Receivable.\"\n\n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This amount is represented by \"Net Increase\" from the cash flow statement under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents.\"\n\nNow, let's parse the provided financial statements:\n\n### Balance Sheet\n- **Interest Receivable**: \n  - End_amount = **10811.11**\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\n- **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: \n  - Net Increase = **-330351.42**\n\n### Income Statement\n- **Interest Income** is also mentioned, but we only need the value from the balance sheet for \"Interest Receivable.\" So, we will not use this line item to fulfill the requirement.\n\nWe compile our findings according to the structure specified in the task:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10811.11', 'value2': '-330351.42'}}\n```",
