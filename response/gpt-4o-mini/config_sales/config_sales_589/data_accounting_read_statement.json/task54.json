Hereâ€™s how we will do it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Financial Statements**:\n   - The problem provides three financial statements: Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, and Income Statement.\n\n2. **Locate Costs Related to Orders and Deliveries**:\n   - In the Income Statement, the relevant item typically associated with securing customer orders and delivering goods and services is the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n3. **Extract the Value of COGS**:\n   - According to the Income Statement, the value for \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is:\n     ```\n     Cost of Goods Sold | 3085000.00 | 2024-01-28\n     ```\n\n4. **Format the Solution**:\n   - Based on our findings, we will present this value in the required JSON format.\n\nPutting it all together, our solution will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3085000.00'} }\n```",
