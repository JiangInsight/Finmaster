However, in this case, we want to focus on the net value of the fixed assets post-depreciation. \n   - **Initial Amount**: 0.00 (not applicable for our extraction as we are only looking at Fixed Assets for tangible value)\n   - **End Amount**: 45,749.30 (this subtracts from our Fixed Assets for net calculation but does not contribute directly to our numbers per the instruction of tangible assets)\n\nNow let's determine the net value of the Fixed Assets by subtracting the Accumulated Depreciation from the Fixed Assets at the end date:\n\n### Net Value Calculation:\n- **Net Fixed Assets End Value** = **Fixed Assets End Amount** - **Accumulated Depreciation End Amount**  \n= 5,106,218.20 - 45,749.30 = 5,060,468.90 (This represents the effective initial value of Fixed Assets held by the company.)\n\nAfter identifying the amounts, we will record the initial and end values of Fixed Assets for our output.\n\n### Final Values to Include:\n- Initial Fixed Assets Value: 5,000,000.00\n- End Fixed Assets Value: 5,106,218.20\n\nAlthough we recognized the concept of accumulated depreciation, the core task only requested initial and final values of tangible items. \n\nNow, present this in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5106218.20'}}\n```",
