These are expected to be realized or consumed in the normal operating cycle.\n   - **Non-current Assets**: This primarily includes fixed assets. These are not intended for immediate sale or consumption and would classify as assets that are not expected to be realized in the normal operating cycle.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Non-current Asset Information**:\n   - From the provided data, the accounts that fall under non-current assets are:\n     - Fixed Assets\n     - Total Non-current Assets\n   \n   The initial and end amounts for these accounts are:\n   - **Initial Total Non-current Assets**: 5000000.00\n   - **End Total Non-current Assets**: 5060468.90\n\n4. **Prepare the Solution**:\n   According to the above identification and classifications, we can fill out the JSON with the relevant values for initial and end amount of non-current assets.\n\nThe formatted solution would be:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5060468.90'}}\n```",
