                        "content": "To identify the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers from the income statement, we can analyze the relevant line items:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** - This line item reflects the direct costs associated with the production of the goods that a company sells and is indeed a key cost for delivering products to customers. It is a significant component that represents costs incurred to secure customer orders as well.\n   \n2. **Selling Expenses** - This line item includes costs related to the selling of goods and services, such as sales commissions, advertising, and other related expenses. This is also relevant to the costs incurred to secure orders.\n\nNext, we extract the COGS and Selling Expenses values from the income statement:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 3085000.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: 555218.93\n\nNow, summing these two amounts gives us the total costs incurred to secure orders and deliver goods/services:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Costs} = \\text{Cost of Goods Sold} + \\text{Selling Expenses} = 3085000.00 + 555218.93 = 3640218.93\n\\]\n\nHowever, since we only need the Selling Expenses as a separate figure that represents a specific component of the costs incurred to secure customer orders, we will focus on the Selling Expenses value of 555218.93 in the answer.\n\nThus, the final answer will include the Selling Expenses value as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '555218.93'} }\n```",
