Assuming that the decrease in inventory indicates a reduction in assets available for sale, we can confirm that:\n     - The value of reduction in inventory (assets held for sale) during the period is **-720000.00**.\n\n4. **Formulate the Solution**:\n   - Based on the analysis, we will structure the output in the required JSON format.\n\nFinal solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-720000.00'} }\n```",
