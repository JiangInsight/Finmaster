This represents the total cost of inventories sold during this period. \n\nFrom the analysis:\n\n- The balance sheet confirms the change in inventory, indicating that inventories were sold, which aligns with the COGS.\n- The value of COGS directly reflects the carrying amount of inventories that were sold.\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is given by the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3085000.00'}}\n```",
