The required line items are:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life (Depreciation)**.\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business (Increase/Decrease in Inventory)**.\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities)**.\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period (Net Increase)**.\n\nNow, let's find these values in the provided cash flow statement.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the values\n\n1. **Depreciation**: This is listed as `45749.30` in the cash flow from operating activities.\n2. **Increase (Decrease) in Inventory**: This is listed as `-720000.00`.\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This is recorded as `-106218.20`.\n4. **Net Increase**: This is recorded as `-330351.42`.\n\n### Step 2: Create the JSON output\n\nWe will now populate the JSON format with the identified values, while maintaining the specified order.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '45749.30', 'value2': '-720000.00', 'value3': '-106218.20', 'value4': '-330351.42'}}\n``` \n\nThis output contains all four required line items along with their corresponding values extracted from the cash flow statement.",
