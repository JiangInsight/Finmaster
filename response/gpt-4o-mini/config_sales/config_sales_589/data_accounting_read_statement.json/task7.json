However, the provided information is formatted more like a traditional accounting balance sheet rather than a statement of profit or loss, which usually includes direct expenses such as cost of goods sold, administrative expenses, or operating expenses.\n\nIn this case, we can focus on the line items that typically correlate with expenses. The most relevant items from the balance sheet that can be considered as related to expenses are \"Accumulated Depreciation\" and changes in \"Accounts Payable\" (which can sometimes include expenses accruals).\n\nHere's how we analyze the relevant line item:\n\n1. **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - Initial Value: 0.00\n   - End Value: 45749.30 (as of the end date)\n\nThere are no additional accounts listed that suggest direct expenses; \"Accounts Payable\" is a liability rather than a direct expense but may indicate unpaid expenses.\n\nSince \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is the only clear expense-related account, we can present it.\n\nNow let's put the findings in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45749.30'}}\n```",
