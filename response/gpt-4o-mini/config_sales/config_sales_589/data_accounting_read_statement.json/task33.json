In this case, both line items have the same value, which is **5695115.02**.\n\n2. **Identify the carrying amount of inventories sold**: \n   - This is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\". The value here is **3085000.00**.\n\nBased on the order of the line items in the original statement, we extract:\n- `value1`: The revenue from core operating activities, which is **5695115.02**.\n- `value2`: The carrying amount of inventories sold, which is **3085000.00**.\n\nNow, we will structure our answer according to the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5695115.02', 'value2': '3085000.00'} }\n```",
