Based on the income statement, the line items that contribute to total income are:\n\n- **Main Business Revenue**: 5695115.02\n\nNow let's arrange our final output. The total income is given as the value from the \"Total Revenue\" line item and its sub-item is the \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\nFinally, formatting according to the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5695115.02', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '5695115.02'}} }\n```",
