Our goal is to identify and extract two specific line items: the \"End Amount\" of funds deposited into a bank (Bank Deposits) and the income earned by an entity from financial assets (Interest Income).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Balance Sheet\nFrom the Balance Sheet section, we look for the line that indicates the bank deposits:\n- **Bank Deposits:** The End amount for this line item is **3938781.80**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Income Statement\nIn the Income Statement, we need to find the line item that indicates interest income:\n- **Interest Income:** The amount for this line item is **10811.11**.\n\n### Step 3: Gather Data\nNow we summarize the findings:\n- Value of funds deposited into a bank (bank deposits): 3938781.80\n- Income earned from financial assets (interest income): 10811.11\n\n### Step 4: Format the Solution\nWe need to present our findings in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3938781.80', 'value2': '10811.11'} }\n```\n\nThis contains the end amount for bank deposits (value1) and the income from interest (value2) from the respective financial statements.",
