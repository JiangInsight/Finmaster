Identify the required line items:\nWe need to extract three specific line items:\n- Profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense (this is found in the Income Statement as \"Profit Before Tax\").\n- The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period (this can be found on the Balance Sheet as \"Accounts Payable\").\n- Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (this is found on the Balance Sheet as \"Paid-in Capital\").\n\n### 2. Locate these items in the provided statements:\n**Balance Sheet:**\n- Accounts Payable: 545000.00\n- Paid-in Capital: 13000000.00\n\n**Income Statement:**\n- Profit Before Tax: 1478526.85\n\n### 3. Prepare output in the required format:\nWe will group these values by financial statement type as specified in the task.\n\nSince we need to maintain the original order and group the values, we structure the solution as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1478526.85', 'value3': '545000.00'}}\n```\n\n### Summary of extracted data:\n- **Value 1** corresponds to the Paid-in Capital from the Balance Sheet.\n- **Value 2** corresponds to the Profit Before Tax from the Income Statement.\n- **Value 3** corresponds to the Accounts Payable from the Balance Sheet.\n\nThis provides a clear answer that adheres to the task's requirements.",
