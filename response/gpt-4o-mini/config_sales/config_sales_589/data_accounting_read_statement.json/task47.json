We will also extract the relevant financial data for the computation and break it down into sub-items which represent the starting cash balance and the ending cash balance.\n\n1. **Identify Net Increase**: \n   - From the problem, the \"Net Increase\" value is `-330351.42`.\n   \n2. **Identify Sub-Items**:\n   - The sub-items that contribute to this net increase in cash and cash equivalents are:\n     - **Begin Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents**: `8000000.00`\n     - **Ending Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents**: `7669648.58`\n   \n   We'll confirm:\n   - The net cash increase can be calculated as \n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Increase} = \\text{Ending Balance} - \\text{Beginning Balance} = 7669648.58 - 8000000.00 = -330351.42\n     \\]\n   - This matches with the provided \"Net Increase\", confirming correctness.\n\n3. **Compile Solutions**: \n   Having identified the net increase and the related values, we can consolidate this into the required JSON format.\n\nThe final value is `-330351.42`, the sub-item value1 is `8000000.00`, and the sub-item value2 is `7669648.58`.\n\nThus, the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-330351.42', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '7669648.58'}}\n```",
