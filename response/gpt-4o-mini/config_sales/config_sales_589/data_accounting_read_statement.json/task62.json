                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to extract three specific line items from various financial statements: the amount owed to the entity for credit sales (found in Accounts Receivable), the financing costs incurred (found in Financial Expenses), and cash payments for property, plant, and equipment (found in Purchase of Fixed Assets). We will organize our findings by financial statement type as requested.\n\n### Step 1: Extracting Information from the Balance Sheet\nFrom the balance sheet, we identify the relevant line items:\n\n- **Accounts Receivable** (amount owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit):\n  - End Amount: **1,562,598.26**\n  \n### Step 2: Extracting Information from the Income Statement\nFrom the income statement, we find the relevant line item for financing costs:\n\n- **Financial Expenses** (financing costs incurred by the enterprise to raise funds):\n  - Amount: **142,115.24**\n\n### Step 3: Extracting Information from the Cash Flow Statement\nFrom the cash flow statement, we identify the cash outflow for the acquisition of fixed assets:\n\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets** (cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment):\n  - Amount: **106,218.20**\n\n### Step 4: Formatting the Result\nNow we format the extracted values into the requested JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1562598.26', 'value2': '142115.24', 'value3': '106218.20'}}\n```\n\nThus, the final solution is as stated above.",
