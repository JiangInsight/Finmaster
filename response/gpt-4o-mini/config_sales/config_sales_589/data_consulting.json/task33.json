                        "content": "To solve for the required financial ratios based on the provided financial statements, we need to derive each ratio using the relevant figures from the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement.\n\n### 1. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\nThis ratio measures liquidity by comparing cash generated from operations to current liabilities.\n- **Formula**: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n- **Operating Cash Flow**: From cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -224133.22\n- **Current Liabilities**: From balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities = 829755.77\n- **Calculation**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-224133.22}{829755.77} = -0.27\n  \\]\n\n### 2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\nThis ratio indicates the company's ability to cover total debt with cash flow from operations.\n- **Formula**: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total Liabilities\n- **Total Liabilities**: From balance sheet, Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity = 15023526.85 - 14193771.08 = 829755.77\n- **Calculation**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-224133.22}{829755.77} = -0.27\n  \\]\n\n### 3. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**\nThis ratio indicates how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period.\n- **Formula**: Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: From income statement, COGS = 3085000.00\n- **Average Inventory**: Since no previous year inventory is given, we will use the end inventory directly.\n- **Calculation**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3085000.00}{720000.00} = 4.29\n  \\]\n\n### 4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\nThis ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets.\n- **Formula**: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n- **Calculation**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{829755.77}{14193771.08} = 0.058\n  \\]\n\n### 5. **Quick Ratio**\nThis ratio evaluates a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n- **Formula**: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n- **Current Assets**: From balance sheet, Total Current Assets = 9963057.95\n- **Calculation**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9963057.95 - 720000.00}{829755.77} = 10.89\n  \\]\n\n### 6. **Current Ratio**\nThis ratio assesses a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with current assets.\n- **Formula**: Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n- **Calculation**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{9963057.95}{829755.77} = 12.00\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nNow we compile our results into the JSON format specified:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.27', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.27', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '4.29', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06', 'Quick Ratio': '10.89', 'Current Ratio': '12.00'}}\n```",
