                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: \n   We look at the cash flow statement to find the net cash flow from operating activities. According to the provided cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} = -224133.22\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Debt**:\n   Total Debt is typically calculated as Total Liabilities minus Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable, which represent the short-term liabilities, while the remaining represents the underlying long-term debt.\n   \n   From the balance sheet, we can find the Total Liabilities:\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 829755.77 (this includes Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable)\n   \n   Total Liabilities can be extracted directly from the balance sheet in this case:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Liabilities} = 1200000.00 \\quad \\text{(for context if more non-current liabilities exist)}\n   \\]\n   \n   For our calculation here, we can assume Total Liabilities is simply the sum of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable, which can be further expanded to include all forms of debt. Here, we designate the entire liability sum for simplicity in this specific scenario.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Debt} = \\text{Accounts Payable} + \\text{Taxes Payable} = 545000 + 284755.77 = 829755.77\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values we gathered:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-224133.22}{829755.77} \\approx -0.270\n   \\]\n\nAfter calculating, we round this to two decimal points, which results in:\n\\[\n-0.27\n\\]\n\nFinally, we present this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.27'}}\n```",
