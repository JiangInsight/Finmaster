                        "content": "To calculate the requested financial ratios, we will use data from the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement. Let's break down each step.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\nThis ratio shows how many times a company collects its average accounts receivable during a period. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the data provided:\n- **Total Revenue** = 5695115.02 (from income statement)\n- **Accounts Receivable at End of Period** = 1562598.26 (from balance sheet)\n- **Accounts Receivable at Beginning of Period** = 0.00\n\nCalculating the average accounts receivable:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 1562598.26}{2} = 781299.13\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting into the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5695115.02}{781299.13} \\approx 7.29\n\\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio \n\nThis ratio measures the ability of a company to cover its current liabilities with the cash generated from its operating activities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the data:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** = -224133.22 (from cash flow statement)\n- **Total Current Liabilities** = 829755.77 (from balance sheet)\n\nSubstituting values into the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-224133.22}{829755.77} \\approx -0.27\n\\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThis is similar to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio, but it emphasizes the cash flow in relation to current liabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nSince this ratio utilizes the same figures as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio, it remains the same:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} \\approx -0.27\n\\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\nThis ratio shows how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate revenue:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the data:\n- **Total Revenue** = 5695115.02 \n- **Total Assets at End of Period** = 15023526.85\n- **Total Assets at Beginning of Period** = 13000000.00 \n\nCalculating the average total assets:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{13000000.00 + 15023526.85}{2} = 14011763.43\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting into the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5695115.02}{14011763.43} \\approx 0.41\n\\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nThis ratio measures a companyâ€™s financial leverage, indicating the proportion of debt relative to equity:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Liabilities** = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity\n- **Total Owner's Equity (End)** = 14193771.08\n- **Total Assets (End)** = 15023526.85\n- **Total Liabilities (End)** = 15023526.85 - 14193771.08 = 829755.77\n\nFinally, calculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{829755.77}{14193771.08} \\approx 0.06\n\\]\n\n### Summary\n\nNow we summarize the calculations into the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.29', \n    'operating cash flow ratio': '-0.27', \n    'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.27', \n    'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.41', \n    'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06'\n}}\n```",
