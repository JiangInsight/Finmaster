                        "content": "To calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio, we need to understand the two components involved in this calculation:  \n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow (OCF)**: This figure represents the cash generated from normal business operations. From the cash flow statement, the OCF can be represented by the “Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities”.\n\n2. **Current Liabilities**: Current liabilities generally include accounts payable, taxes payable, and any other liabilities that are due within the next 12 months. From the balance sheet, we can sum these up to find the total current liabilities.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Operating Cash Flow (OCF)\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -224133.22\n\n### Step 2: Identify Current Liabilities\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Accounts Payable = 545000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 284755.77\n- Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 545000.00 + 284755.77 = 829755.77\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in our figures:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-224133.22}{829755.77}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the value:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} \\approx -0.2705\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the result in the specified JSON format\nWe need to present this result in the required format. \n\nThus, the final answer will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.27'} }\n``` \n\nThis maintains two decimal places, consistent with typical financial reporting standards.",
