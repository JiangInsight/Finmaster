Here's how to approach the task:\n\n1. **Identify transactions that contribute to accounts receivable:**\n   - Look for transactions with the `payment/receipt_status` as \"Unpaid.\" These transactions represent sales that have added to accounts receivable.\n\n2. **Calculate total amounts that increase accounts receivable:**\n   - Each unpaid sale increases the accounts receivable.\n\n3. **Identify transactions that reduce accounts receivable:**\n   - Look for transactions with the `payment/receipt_status` as \"Paid.\" These transactions represent sales that have been settled and thus reduce accounts receivable.\n\n4. **Calculate total amounts that decrease accounts receivable:**\n   - Each paid sale reduces the accounts receivable.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The overall change in accounts receivable is calculated by subtracting the total amount decreased from the total amount increased.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Data\nNow, letâ€™s summarize the calculations:\n\n#### **Sales and Accounts Receivable Analysis:**\n\n- **Sales that Increase Accounts Receivable (Unpaid Transactions):**\n  - Sale20240102004: Amount = 37626.38\n  - Sale20240103007: Amount = 38445.68\n  - Sale20240105015: Amount = 35631.18\n  - Sale20240105058: Amount = 38068.12\n  - Sale20240109030: Amount = 18677.88\n  - Sale20240110036: Amount = 56061.81\n  - Sale20240111040: Amount = 105728.19\n  - Sale20240114053: Amount = 90231.82\n  - Sale20240114054: Amount = 51088.44\n  - Sale20240115058: Amount = 38068.12\n  - Sale20240117065: Amount = 37557.79\n  - Sale20240117067: Amount = 26920.14\n  - Sale20240120078: Amount = 58291.95\n  - Sale20240121081: Amount = 55928.04\n  - Sale20240124090: Amount = 261905.28\n  - Sale20240124092: Amount = 29437.83\n  - Sale20240126097: Amount = 39113.14\n  - Sale20240127002: Amount = 36474.74\n  - Sale20240128009: Amount = 268538.4\n\n  Total increase in accounts receivable = \n  \\( 37626.38 + 38445.68 + 35631.18 + 38068.12 + 18677.88 + 56061.81 + 105728.19 + 90231.82 + 51088.44 + 38068.12 + 37557.79 + 26920.14 + 58291.95 + 55928.04 + 261905.28 + 29437.83 + 39113.14 + 36474.74 + 268538.4 \\)\n\n  = **1,084,186.73**\n\n- **Sales that Decrease Accounts Receivable (Paid Transactions):**\n  - Sale20240102003: Amount = 86364.37\n  - Sale20240103006: Amount = 52195.47\n  - Sale20240105014: Amount = 97747.17\n  - Sale20240105016: Amount = 52194.45\n  - Sale20240107022: Amount = 34907.97\n  - Sale20240107023: Amount = 34536.92\n  - Sale20240108025: Amount = 96880.03\n  - Sale20240108027: Amount = 8630.0\n  - Sale20240109029: Amount = 283990.68\n  - Sale20240109031: Amount = 34288.34\n  - Sale20240109032: Amount = 58095.09\n  - Sale20240110035: Amount = 27641.55\n  - Sale20240110037: Amount = 27073.41\n  - Sale20240111039: Amount = 18414.34\n  - Sale20240111041: Amount = 19778.28\n  - Sale20240111042: Amount = 37069.99\n  - Sale20240112044: Amount = 17929.87\n  - Sale20240112045: Amount = 177577.94\n  - Sale20240112085: Amount = 78129.82\n  - Sale20240125094: Amount = 117253.26\n\n  Total decrease in accounts receivable =\n  \\( 86364.37 + 52195.47 + 97747.17 + 52194.45 + 34907.97 + 34536.92 + 96880.03 + 8630.0 + 283990.68 + 34288.34 + 58095.09 + 27641.55 + 27073.41 + 18414.34 + 19778.28 + 37069.99 + 17929.87 + 177577.94 + 78129.82 + 117253.26 \\)\n\n  = **1,163,556.64**\n\n### Final Calculation:\n- **Increase in Accounts Receivable:** 1,084,186.73\n- **Decrease in Accounts Receivable:** 1,163,556.64\n\nThe final change in accounts receivable is:\n\\[\n\\text{Change} = \\text{Total Increase} - \\text{Total Decrease} = 1,084,186.73 - 1,163,556.64 = -79,369.91\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-79369.91'}}\n```",
