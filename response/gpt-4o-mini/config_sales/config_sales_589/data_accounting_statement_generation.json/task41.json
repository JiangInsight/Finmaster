We will sum the amounts from these transactions.\n\n2. **Calculate Increases in Accounts Payable from Purchases**:\n   - **Unpaid Purchases**:\n     - Purchase of Product B from Supplier 2: 90,000.00\n     - Purchase of Product A from Supplier 3: 30,000.00\n     - Purchase of Product B from Supplier 2: 60,000.00\n     - Purchase of Product B from Supplier 8: 200,000.00\n     - Purchase of Product B from Supplier 10: 140,000.00\n\n   Total Increase from Unpaid Purchases:\n   \\[\n   90,000 + 30,000 + 60,000 + 200,000 + 140,000 = 520,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Decreases in Accounts Payable from Payments**:\n   - **Paid Purchases**:\n     - (There are other paid purchases, but they do not decrease accounts payable since they have been paid off. We will only account for unpaid purchases.)\n   - There are no decreases from paid purchases; hence no adjustments will be made from this category.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The total increase in accounts payable is simply the sum of all unpaid purchases.\n\n### Final Calculation Result\nThe total increase in accounts payable is **520,000.00**.\n\n### JSON Output\nWe will format the answer in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '520000.00'} }\n```",
