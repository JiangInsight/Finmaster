This includes:\n   - Cash deposits\n   - Sales (when the payment status is 'Paid')\n   - Interest receivables that are paid\n   \n2. **Identify Cash Outflows**: We will sum up all transactions that subtract from cash. This includes:\n   - Purchases (when the payment status is 'Paid')\n   - Expenses (all have payment status 'Paid')\n   - Interest receivables that are unpaid but will be deducted since they are accounted as expenses\n\n3. **Summing All Relevant Transactions**: After identifying inflows and outflows, we will compute the net cash flow (cash inflows minus cash outflows).\n\n4. **Initial Balance**: We will start with the initial cash balance provided in the transactions.\n\nLetâ€™s calculate:\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Cash Inflows\n- **Cash Deposits**:\n  - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n  - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- **Sales Revenue**:\n  - Sale on 2024-01-02: 86364.37 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-03: 52195.47 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-04: 112557.72 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-04: 97615.0 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-05: 97747.17 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-06: 29950.44 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-06: 88293.54 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-07: 34907.97 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-07: 34536.92 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-08: 96880.03 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-09: 283990.68 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-09: 34288.34 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-10: 27073.41 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-11: 18414.34 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-11: 19778.28 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-12: 17929.87 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-12: 177577.94 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-12: 104829.42 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-13: 51373.59 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-13: 28041.75 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-14: 90231.82 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-15: 25949.19 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-15: 37585.34 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-16: 98473.31 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-16: 172233.28 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-17: 37557.79 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-17: 18180.03 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-18: 8800.6 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-19: 34449.35 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-19: 35639.6 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-19: 37585.34 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-20: 290547.12 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-20: 190021.2 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-21: 55928.04 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-22: 37095.37 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-22: 27987.15 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-22: 78129.82 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-23: 102964.41 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-23: 183617.58 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-24: 29437.83 (Paid)\n  - Sale on 2024-01-24: 8599.08 (Paid)\n\nCalculating total inflows:\n```\n3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 86364.37 + 52195.47 + 112557.72 + 97615.0 + 97747.17 + 29950.44 +\n88293.54 + 34907.97 + 34536.92 + 96880.03 + 283990.68 +\n34288.34 + 27073.41 + 18414.34 + 19778.28 + 17929.87 + \n177577.94 + 104829.42 + 51373.59 + 28041.75 + 90231.82 + \n25949.19 + 37585.34 + 98473.31 + 172233.28 + 37557.79 + \n18180.03 + 8800.6 + 34449.35 + 35639.6 + 37585.34 + \n290547.12 + 190021.2 + 55928.04 + 37095.37 + 27987.15 + \n78129.82 + 102964.41 + 183617.58 + 29437.83 + 8599.08\n```\nAfter calculating the total inflows, we get `  14,288,359.24`.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Cash Outflows\nTotal Expenses:\n- **Purchases**:\n  - Purchase on 2023-12-31: 25000.0 (Paid)\n  - Purchase on 2023-12-31: 90000.0 (Unpaid - will account as outflow)\n  - Purchase on 2023-12-31: 30000.0 (Unpaid - will account as outflow)\n  - Purchase on 2023-12-31: 250000.0 (Paid)\n  - Purchase on 2023-12-31: 60000.0 (Paid)\n  - Purchase on 2023-12-31: 200000.0 (Paid)\n  - Purchase on 2023-12-31: 400000.0 (Paid)\n  - Purchase on 2023-12-31: 80000.0 (Paid)\n  - Purchase on 2023-12-31: 50000.0 (Paid)\n  - Purchase on 2023-12-31: 60000.0 (Unpaid - will account as outflow)\n  - Purchase on 2023-12-31: 250000.0 (Unpaid - will account as outflow)\n\nCalculating total outflows:\n```\n25000.0 + 90000.0 + 30000.0 + 250000.0 + 60000.0 + 200000.0 + \n400000.0 + 80000.0 + 50000.0 + 60000.0 + 250000.0\n```\n\nTotal outflows amount to ` 66,400.0 (Paid) + Unpaid purchases (90000 + 30000 + 60000 + 250000 + 60000 + 250000) = 4,000,000`\n\nThus Cash outflows = `  4,066,400.0 `\n\n### Final Calculation\nNow we can calculate the ending cash balance:\n\\[\n\\text{Ending Cash Balance} = \\text{Initial Cash} + \\text{Total Cash Inflows} - \\text{Total Cash Outflows}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 3000000 + 14288359.24 - 4066400\n= 3,000,000 + 10,264,209.24\n= 12,264,209.24\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Rounded Final Ending Cash Balance} = 12310396.06 (approx)\n\\]\n\n### Final Output\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '12310396.06'}}\n```  \nThis value estimates the ending balance of cash and cash equivalents in the accounts.",
