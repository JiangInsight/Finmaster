We will not differentiate between paid and unpaid purchases for this calculation since they contribute to the asset value.\n\n3. **Identify Depreciation:** We will subtract any depreciation recorded during the period from the total fixed assets amount.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:** The end value of fixed assets will be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Fixed Assets} = \\text{Initial Fixed Assets} + \\text{Total Purchases} - \\text{Total Depreciation}\n   \\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Initial Fixed Assets Amount:**\n   - From the initial entries:\n     - Fixed Assets Amount: **$5,000,000.00**\n\n2. **Fixed Asset Purchases:**\n   - Identifying all purchases that qualify as fixed assets:\n     - **FixedAsset20231231001**: $106,218.20 \n\n   Total Purchases:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Purchases} = 106,218.20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Depreciation Amount:**\n   - From the depreciation entries:\n     - Depreciation recorded: **$45,749.30**\n\n4. **Final Fixed Assets Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Fixed Assets} = 5,000,000 + 106,218.20 - 45,749.30 = 5,060,468.90\n   \\]\n\n### Presenting the Solution:\nNow that we have calculated the initial and final values of the fixed assets, we can present the solution in the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Fixed Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Fixed Assets End Value': '5060468.90'}}\n```",
