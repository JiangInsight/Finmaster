                        "content": "To calculate the Total Non-current Assets Initial Value and the Total Non-current Assets End Value based on the provided data, we need to consider the \"Fixed Assets\" and the \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" entries.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Initial Non-current Assets Value\n\nFrom the dataset provided, we identify the initial fixed assets entries:\n- **Fixed Assets (Initial)**: 5,000,000.00 (recorded on 2023-12-31)\n\nFor initial fixed assets, we can add any other purchases that were made that also count towards non-current assets:\n- **Purchase** entries that are related directly to non-current assets:\n  - Fixed Asset Purchase: 106,218.20 (recorded on 2023-12-31)\n\nSo, the total initial value is calculated as follows:\n\n#### Initial Total Non-current Assets Value:\n\\[\n\\text{Initial Total Non-current Assets} = \\text{Fixed Assets} + \\text{Fixed Asset Purchase}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial Total Non-current Assets} = 5,000,000.00 + 106,218.20 = 5,106,218.20\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Ending Non-current Assets Value\n\nNext, we will sum all purchases of non-current assets and consider any depreciation that may have taken place.\n\nWe only care about fixed assets that signify long-term capital assets. The entries that contribute to this are:\n- Fixed Asset Purchase\n- Fixed Assets (if there were adjustments in the sales or depreciation)\n\nThe purchase amounts and the depreciation entries beyond the initial timestamp must be summed up:\n- **Sales** will not be considered for fixed assets as they reduce the values.\n- **Depreciation** recorded entries must be summed to reduce the asset value correspondingly.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n1. We sum the amounts for fixed asset purchases.\n2. We subtract depreciation.\n\n#### Calculating Total Non-current Assets:\n- Fixed Asset Purchase recorded: 106218.20 from fixed assets.\n- The total depreciation should be summed. For example:\n  - Depreciation Amount: 45749.30 (recorded on 2024-01-01)\n\nSo now we can sum everything that counts as a non-current asset, adjust for any depreciation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Non-current Assets End Value} = \\text{Initial Value} + \\text{New Purchases} - \\text{Depreciation}\n\\]\n\nConsidering the purchase adjustments and depreciation:\n\\[\n\\text{End Total Non-current Assets} = 5,106,218.20 + 106218.20 - 45749.30\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n1. Initial Value: \\( 5,000,000 + 106,218.20 = 5,106,218.20 \\)\n2. Subtracting Depreciation: \n   - \\( 5,106,218.20 - 45749.30 = 5,060,468.90 .\\)\n\n### Final Values:\n1. **Initial Total Non-current Assets Value**: 5,106,218.20\n2. **Ending Total Non-current Assets Value**: 5,060,468.90\n\n### JSON Output\nNow, we format this into the required JSON format for the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5106218.20', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5060468.90'}}\n```",
