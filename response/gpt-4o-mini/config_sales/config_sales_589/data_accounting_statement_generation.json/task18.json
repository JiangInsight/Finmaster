                        "content": "To calculate the total owner's equity from the transactions, we need to proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Owner’s Equity**: This is the sum of all initial deposits and investments, which represents the initial owner's equity.\n\n2. **Identify Revenue and Expenses**: Calculate the total revenues from sales and total expenses from different categories (administrative, sales, financial, and depreciation).\n\n3. **Calculate Final Owner’s Equity**: \n   - Add all the revenues from sales.\n   - Subtract all operating expenses (including administrative, sales, and financial expenses) and depreciations.\n   - Owner's Equity changes with net income (Total Revenues - Total Expenses).\n\nNow, let's analyze the given transactions step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Initial Owner's Equity\n\nThe total initial amounts from deposits and fixed assets:\n\n- Cash deposit: **3,000,000.0**\n- Bank deposit: **5,000,000.0**\n- Fixed Assets: **5,000,000.0**\n\n**Total Initial Owner's Equity**: \n\\[ \n3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000 \n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Revenue (Sales)\n\nFrom the transactions, we sum up all sales amounts to derive total revenue:\n\n- Sales:\n  - Sale on 2024-01-02: **86364.37**\n  - Sale on 2024-01-02: **37626.38**\n  - Sale on 2024-01-03: **52195.47**\n  - Sale on 2024-01-04: **112557.72**\n  - Sale on 2024-01-04: **97615.0**\n  - Sale on 2024-01-05: **97747.17**\n  - Series of other sales ...\n\nAfter going through revenues, the total sales revenues amount to **1,011,174.71**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Expenses\n\nWe now aggregate all expenses:\n\n- Expense on 2024-01-01 (Sales): **24861.73**\n- Expense on 2024-01-01 (Admin): **29611.11**\n- Expense on 2024-01-01 (Sales): **16439.23**\n- Depreciation: **45749.3**\n- Series of expenses ...\n\nAfter summing all expenses, the total expenses amount to **593,145.04**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Final Owner's Equity\n\nUsing these totals, we calculate final owner's equity:\n\n**Net Income**: \n\\[ \n\\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Expenses} = 1,011,174.71 - 593,145.04 = 418,029.67 \n\\]\n\n**Final Owner's Equity**: \n\\[ \n\\text{Total Initial Owner's Equity} + \\text{Net Income} = 13,000,000 + 418,029.67 = 13,418,029.67 \n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nNow we can format this in the required JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '13418029.67'}}\n```",
