However, in this dataset, all other transactions primarily represent operating expenses, sales, or purchases, rather than changes in equity through new capital or withdrawals.\n\n4. **Calculate Paid-in Capital End Value**: As examined, there are no other transactions that directly impact the paid-in capital. It remains unchanged, at **13,000,000.0**, as there are no new capitalizations or capital withdrawals specified in the dataset.\n\nLastly, the values are consolidated into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
