                        "content": "To generate the balance sheet based on the provided transaction data, we first need to summarize the impact of all transactions on the initial and ending values of various accounts involved.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation\n\n#### Initial Values\n\n1. **Cash on Hand Initial Value**: The initial cash deposit is indicated as **3,000,000.00**.\n2. **Bank Deposits Initial Value**: The initial bank deposit is **5,000,000.00**.\n3. **Interest Receivable Initial Value**: Starting with zero as there are no transactions affecting it yet.\n4. **Accounts Receivable Initial Value**: Initially set to zero; no sales have been recorded at the start.\n5. **Inventory Initial Value**: No inventory recorded at the beginning, so it’s **0.00**.\n6. **Total Current Assets Initial Value**: Sum of cash, bank deposits, interest receivables, accounts receivable, and inventory which equals:\n   - 3,000,000.00 (cash) + 5,000,000.00 (bank) + 0.00 (interest) + 0.00 (accounts receivable) + 0.00 (inventory) = **8,000,000.00**.\n7. **Fixed Assets Initial Value**: Fixed assets were recorded at **5,000,000.00**.\n8. **Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value**: Starting at **0.00** since depreciation hasn’t begun yet.\n9. **Total Non-current Assets Initial Value**: Equal to fixed assets - accumulated depreciation = **5,000,000.00**.\n10. **Total Assets Initial Value**: Sum of current and non-current assets = 8,000,000.00 (current) + 5,000,000.00 (non-current) = **13,000,000.00**.\n11. **Accounts Payable Initial Value**: No recorded liabilities at the start, hence it’s **0.00**.\n12. **Taxes Payable Initial Value**: Also starts at **0.00**.\n13. **Total Current Liabilities Initial Value**: Sum of accounts payable and taxes payable = **0.00**.\n14. **Paid-in Capital Initial Value**: Same as total assets initially as no changes indicating retained earnings <> 0: **13,000,000.00**.\n15. **Retained Earnings Initial Value**: Starting at **0.00**; no profits have been recorded initially.\n16. **Total Owner's Equity Initial Value**: Equals paid-in capital + retained earnings = 13,000,000.00 (paid-in) + 0.00 (retained) = **13,000,000.00**.\n17. **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity Initial Value**: Total current liabilities + total owner’s equity = 0.00 (liabilities) + 13,000,000.00 = **13,000,000.00**.\n\n#### Transactions Impact\n\nNow, we proceed through the transactions list, updating totals for end values according to the specified account types.\n\n- **Cash Transactions** include cash deposits or receipts from sales, payments for expenses, and cash used for purchases.\n- **Bank Deposits Transactions** include any deposits recorded.\n- **Accounts Receivable Transactions** will increase as sales are recorded (on credit).\n- **Interest Receivable** values will be updated as new interest amounts are added.\n- **Inventory** adjusts based on purchases recorded.\n- **Accounts Payable** increases with unpaid purchase transactions, and is reduced when payments are made.\n\n#### Ending Values Calculation\n\nAfter processing all transactions:\n- **Cash on Hand End Value**: Calculate the cash received (total from sales) and amounts paid for expenses and purchases.\n- **Bank Deposits End Value**: Calculate any changes from bank deposits and withdrawals.\n- **Interest Receivable End Value**: Consider all the newly accrued interests.\n- **Accounts Receivable End Value**: Sum of new sales made on credit.\n- **Inventory End Value**: All earnings from purchases.\n- **Total Current Assets End Value**: Sum of all current assets.\n- **Fixed Assets End Value**: Original fixed assets minus depreciation accumulated.\n- **Accumulated Depreciation End Value**: Sum of depreciation costs.\n- **Total Non-current Assets End Value**: Equals fixed assets end value minus accumulated depreciation.\n- **Total Assets End Value**: Sum of total current and non-current assets.\n- **Accounts Payable End Value**: Sum all unpaid purchases.\n- **Taxes Payable**: Total taxes incurred up to this point.\n- **Total Current Liabilities End Value**: Sum of accounts and taxes payable.\n- **Paid-in Capital End Value**: Remains unchanged.\n- **Retained Earnings End Value**: Based on profit/losses calculated from sales minus expenses, taxes, and depreciation.\n- **Total Owner's Equity End Value**: Total paid-in capital plus retained earnings.\n- **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity End Value**: Sum of total liabilities and total equity.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nAll values are computed based on summarizing all transactions.
