                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Cash Flow from Operating Activities**:\n   From the cash flow statements provided:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is `1598438.00`.\n\n2. **Identify Total Debt**:\n   Total Debt can be understood as total liabilities. From the balance sheet provided, we can see:\n   - **Total Current Liabilities** consists of:\n     - Accounts Payable: `1820000.00`\n     - Taxes Payable: `290671.05`\n     Thus, Total Current Liabilities = `1820000.00 + 290671.05 = 2110671.05`.\n\n   In this case, we don't have additional long-term liabilities provided, hence, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = `2110671.05`.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{1598438.00}{2110671.05} \\approx 0.756\n   \\]\n\n4. **Presenting the Result**:\n   We round this to two decimal places for representation, which gives us approximately `0.76`.\n\nFollowing this reasoning, the answer in the required JSON format will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.76'}}\n```",
