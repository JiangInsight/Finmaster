                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we need two main pieces of information: \n\n1. **Net Credit Sales**: This can typically be derived from total sales. For this analysis, we'll assume that the total revenue reported in the income statement represents net credit sales.\n\n2. **Average Accounts Receivable**: This is calculated as the average of the beginning and ending balances of accounts receivable during the period.\n\n### Step 1: Determine Net Credit Sales\nFrom the income statement provided, the total revenue (which we'll consider as net credit sales) is:\n\n- Total Revenue = **5,813,420.67**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Average Accounts Receivable\nNext, we need the beginning and ending balances for accounts receivable:\n\n- Beginning Accounts Receivable (as of 2023-12-31): **0.00**\n- Ending Accounts Receivable (as of 2024-01-28): **1,355,463.34**\n\nNow we calculate the average accounts receivable:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning AR} + \\text{Ending AR}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 1355463.34}{2} = 677,731.67\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThe Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5813420.67}{677731.67} \\approx 8.57\n\\]\n\n### Final Output\nNow we present the result in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '8.57'}}\n```",
