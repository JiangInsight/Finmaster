This amount reflects the additional liability incurred by the entity for goods or services on credit.\n\n3. **Finalizing the Solution**: \n   This extracted value will be the answer needed for the solution. \n\nTherefore, the value of the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is 1,820,000.00.\n\nNow we format this into the required JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1820000.00'} }\n```",
