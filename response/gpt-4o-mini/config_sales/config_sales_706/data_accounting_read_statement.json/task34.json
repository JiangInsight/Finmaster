Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities.\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole.\n\nFrom the given income statement:\n\n1. **Total Income:** This could correspond to the \"Total Revenue\" or the \"Main Business Revenue.\" In this case, both values appear to be the same, so we can use either. Here, I'll use \"Total Revenue\" as the total income. \n   - Total Revenue: **5813420.67**\n\n2. **Carrying Amount of Inventories Sold:** This is typically indicated by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS). \n   - Cost of Goods Sold: **3175000.00**\n\n3. **Costs of General Management and Administration:** This is usually represented by \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n   - Administrative Expenses: **191069.49**\n\nNow let's compile these values into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5813420.67', 'value2': '3175000.00', 'value3': '191069.49'}}\n```",
