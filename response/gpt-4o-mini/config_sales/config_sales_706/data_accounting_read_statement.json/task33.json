In this case, the relevant line items we can consider are:\n   - **Main Business Revenue**: This is typically the primary source of income from the company's core operations.\n   - **Total Revenue**: While this can include other income sources, in this instance, it is the same as the Main Business Revenue.\n\n   Since both are the same, we will select **Main Business Revenue** as the line item of interest.\n\n2. **Identify Carrying Amount of Inventories Sold**: This is commonly represented as:\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This line item reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company.\n\nNow, based on the identified line items, we extract their respective values:\n\n- **Main Business Revenue**: 5813420.67\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 3175000.00\n\nGiven this analysis, we will form the solution in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5813420.67', 'value2': '3175000.00'}}\n```",
