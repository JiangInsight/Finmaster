In this context, we specifically look for two types of liabilities mentioned: \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\".\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Items**:\n   - From the balance sheet, we can identify the following line items related to current liabilities:\n     - Accounts Payable\n     - Taxes Payable\n     - Total Current Liabilities (this represents the sum of the above)\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Accounts Payable**:\n     - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n     - End Amount: `1,820,000.00`\n   - **Taxes Payable**:\n     - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n     - End Amount: `290,671.05`\n   - **Total Current Liabilities**:\n     - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n     - End Amount: `2,110,671.05` (which is the sum of the end amounts of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable)\n\n3. **Determine the Initial and End Values for Total Current Liabilities**:\n   - The initial value of Total Current Liabilities is `0.00` as indicated in the balance sheet.\n   - The end value of Total Current Liabilities is directly taken from the end amounts, which is `2,110,671.05`.\n\n### Final Output:\nNow we can present this structured in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2110671.05'} }\n```",
