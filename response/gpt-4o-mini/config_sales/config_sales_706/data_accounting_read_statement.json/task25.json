                        "content": "To determine the specific line items and their values related to costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers from the income statement provided, we need to identify relevant accounts.\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. It includes costs that are directly tied to the creation of products sold by the company, such as labor and materials.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses**: This category typically includes costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver products, such as advertising expenses, sales force salaries, and distribution expenses.\n\nNow, looking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold** is listed as **3,175,000.00**.\n- **Selling Expenses** is listed as **731,171.32**.\n\nThe total of the relevant costs (as these are the costs that can be tied to securing orders and delivering goods) is the sum of COGS and Selling Expenses:\n\n- Total Costs related to securing and delivering: \n   - COGS: 3,175,000.00\n   - Selling Expenses: 731,171.32\n   - **Total** = 3,175,000.00 + 731,171.32 = **3,906,171.32**\n\nHowever, since the problem specifically asks for costs incurred to secure customer orders (Selling Expenses) versus delivering goods (Cost of Goods Sold), I will provide the sum of Selling Expenses only for the requested solution format.\n\nFrom analyzing the statement closely, the specific cost incurred to secure customer orders would be captured entirely under Selling Expenses, which is explicitly listed.\n\nThus, the extracted value to solve the task is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '731171.32'} }\n```",
