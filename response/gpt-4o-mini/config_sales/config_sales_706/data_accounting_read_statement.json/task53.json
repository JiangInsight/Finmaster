Balance Sheet\n2. Cash Flow Statement\n3. Income Statement\n\n### Step 2: Locate Inventory Values\n- **Balance Sheet**:\n  - The inventory account shows a carrying amount of 295000.00 at the end of the reporting period.\n  \n- **Income Statement**:\n  - Here, there is a line item labeled \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which is typically where the costs of inventories sold are recorded. The value listed is 3175000.00. \n\n### Step 3: Determine the Value of Inventories Sold\nThe line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" represents the value of inventory that has been sold during the reporting period. Therefore, we can consider this as the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 3175000.00. \n\n### Final Answer\nNow, we can format the answer according to the instruction given:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3175000.00'}}\n```",
