The line item of interest is \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\".\n2. In the provided cash flow statement, this line item indicates amounts owed to the entity. A decrease in accounts receivable suggests that the entity has received cash for sales that were previously made on credit, hence positively affecting cash flow.\n3. The amount for this line item is given as **-1355463.34**. \n\nWhen analyzing this, we find that -1355463.34 indicates a cash inflow due to collections of accounts receivable, reflecting a decrease in amounts owed.\n\nThus, we will present this identified value in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1355463.34'} }\n```",
