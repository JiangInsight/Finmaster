                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to extract three specific line items from the cash flow statement related to:\n\n1. The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period (i.e., increase in accounts payable).\n2. The acquisition of property, plant, and equipment (i.e., purchase of fixed assets).\n3. The cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\nWe will go through the cash flow statement step-by-step and pick out the relevant line items based on their descriptions.\n\n1. For the line item related to the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period:\n   - The relevant entry is:\n     ```plaintext\n     Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 1820000.00\n     ```\n   This indicates that the entity's accounts payable increased by 1,820,000.00, which is the addition owed by the entity during the period.\n\n2. For the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment:\n   - The relevant entry is:\n     ```plaintext\n     Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 352857.55\n     ```\n   This indicates that the entity purchased fixed assets worth 352,857.55 during the period.\n\n3. For cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period:\n   - The relevant entry is:\n     ```plaintext\n     Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00\n     ```\n   This indicates that the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period amounted to 8,000,000.00.\n\nNow that we have the values for the three specific line items, we can format our answer as requested.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1820000.00', 'value2': '352857.55', 'value3': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
