We scan through the line items listed under \"Account\" in the problem statement to locate any line item that relates to financing costs.\n  \n2. The line items in the income statement include several categories like Main Business Revenue, Cost of Goods Sold, and Expenses. We're specifically interested in finding a category associated with financial or financing costs.\n\n3. Upon review, we find the line item that explicitly mentions \"Financial Expenses\". This is typically where companies record costs related to borrowing, such as interest on loans and other financing activities.\n\n4. The amount corresponding to \"Financial Expenses\" is 287278.52.\n\n5. We'll format the solution as specified in the instruction.\n\nThus, our final answer will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '287278.52'} }\n```",
