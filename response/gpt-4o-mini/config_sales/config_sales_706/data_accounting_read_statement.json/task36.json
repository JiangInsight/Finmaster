Cash Flow From Operating Activities\n2. **Net Profit: 1103190.60** - This line item indicates the profit retained after all deductions.\n3. Other line items related to depreciation, changes in accounts receivable, interest receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and tax payable.\n4. Additional sections for investing activities and cash equivalents, but these do not affect the determination of net profit.\n\nConsidering the position of \"Net Profit\" in the context of the cash flow statement, we confirm:\n\n- The value for \"Net Profit\" is clearly stated as **1103190.60**.\n\nNow we prepare the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1103190.60'} }\n```",
