We'll look at each financial statement in the order specified: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement.\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - The line item of interest is \"Interest Receivable\":\n     - End amount = **10710.07** (This is the interest accrued but not yet received).\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - The applicable line item is \"Interest Income\":\n     - The amount is **10710.07**, but this represents interest that has been recognized during the period rather than accrued but not yet received, so we won't extract it from here.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - We look for the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents:\n   - The line item is \"Net Increase\":\n     - This shows a **1245580.45** addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\nNow integrating these two values into the required JSON format:\n\n- Value1 (Interest accrued but not yet received from the balance sheet): **10710.07**\n- Value2 (Net increase in cash and cash equivalents from the cash flow statement): **1245580.45**\n\nHereâ€™s the formatted solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10710.07', 'value2': '1245580.45'} }\n```",
