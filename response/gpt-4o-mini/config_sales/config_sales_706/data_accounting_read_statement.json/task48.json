The **Net Profit** amount, which represents the profit retained after all expenses (including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) have been deducted from total revenue.\n2. The **Purchase of Fixed Assets** amount, which indicates the cash paid for capital expenditures on long-term assets like property, plant, and equipment.\n\nNow, let's go through the cash flow statement provided step by step to identify these amounts:\n\n1. The first relevant line item we encounter is **Net Profit**:\n   - According to the data, the **Net Profit** is **1103190.60**.\n\n2. The next relevant line item is **Purchase of Fixed Assets**:\n   - In the cash flow from investing activities, the line item **Purchase of Fixed Assets** indicates an amount of **352857.55**.\n\nAfter identifying both amounts, we can summarize them as follows:\n\n- **value1** (Net Profit) = **1103190.60**\n- **value2** (Purchase of Fixed Assets) = **352857.55**\n\nThus, we can format the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1103190.60', 'value2': '352857.55'}}\n```",
