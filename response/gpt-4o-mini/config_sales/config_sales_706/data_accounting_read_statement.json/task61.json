                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify and extract specific line items from the three financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement). The line items of interest are:\n\n1. Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers (this corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the Income Statement).\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets (this corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement).\n\nNow, let's look at the statements provided and find the necessary values:\n\n### Balance Sheet\nThe Balance Sheet includes:\n- Cash on Hand\n- Bank Deposits\n- Interest Receivable\n- Accounts Receivable\n- Inventory\n- Total Current Assets\n- Fixed Assets\n- Accumulated Depreciation\n- Total Non-current Assets\n- Total Assets\n- Accounts Payable\n- Taxes Payable\n- Total Current Liabilities\n- Paid-in Capital\n- Retained Earnings\n- Total Owner's Equity\n- Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\n\nNone of the required values are present in the Balance Sheet.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\nThe Cash Flow Statement includes:\n- Cash Flow From Operating Activities\n- Net Profit\n- Depreciation\n- (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n- (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n- (Increase) Decrease in Inventory\n- Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n- Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n- Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: **352857.55** (this is our required value for cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment)\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents\n- Beginning Balance\n- Ending Balance\n- Net Increase\n\nWe've identified the value related to cash payments for fixed assets.\n\n### Income Statement\nThe Income Statement includes:\n- Main Business Revenue\n- Total Revenue\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: **3175000.00** (this is our required value for costs incurred to secure customer orders)\n- Total Cost\n- Gross Profit\n- Administrative Expenses\n- Selling Expenses\n- Depreciation\n- Financial Expenses\n- Total Expenses\n- Interest Income\n- Profit Before Tax\n- Tax Expense\n- Net Profit\n\nWe've identified the value related to the cost of goods sold.\n\n### Summary of Extracted Values:\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold** (Income Statement) = **3175000.00**\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets** (Cash Flow Statement) = **352857.55**\n\n### Final Step\nNow we will compile these values in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3175000.00', 'value2': '352857.55'} }\n```",
