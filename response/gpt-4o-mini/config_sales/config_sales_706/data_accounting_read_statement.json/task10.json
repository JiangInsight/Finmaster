This account reflects the amount shareholders have directly contributed in exchange for shares issued.\n\n1. Locate the \"Paid-in Capital\" line item in the balance sheet:\n   - From the data provided, we identify \"Paid-in Capital\" with an initial amount of 13000000.00 on 2023-12-31 and an end amount of 13000000.00 on 2024-01-28.\n\n2. Record the initial and final values:\n   - The initial value of \"Paid-in Capital\" is 13000000.00.\n   - The end value of \"Paid-in Capital\" is also 13000000.00.\n\n3. Structure the solution:\n   - According to the required JSON format, we create a solution object that includes both the initial and end values of the \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\nNow, combining these findings, we get the final solution as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
