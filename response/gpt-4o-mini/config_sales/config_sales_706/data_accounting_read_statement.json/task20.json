In general, the line item that directly relates to the cost of goods sold (COGS) reflects the expense incurred for the inventory that was sold.\n\nBy reviewing the income statement provided in the problem, we will locate the entry for \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\nHere are the steps taken:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Accounts**: Look for terminology like \"Cost of Goods Sold\" which is normally indicative of the value of inventory sold.\n2. **Locate the Value**: Find the corresponding amount for that line item in the statement.\n\nIn the provided income statement:\n\n- The line **\"Cost of Goods Sold\"** is present.\n- Its value is **3175000.00**.\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is equivalent to the Cost of Goods Sold.\n\nNow we can format our answer according to the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3175000.00'} }\n```",
