The line:\n\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**: -10710.07 (indicating an increase in the interest receivable balance by this amount)\n\n### Step 4: Prepare the Final Results\nBased on the extracted data, we can summarize the findings:\n\n- **Initial Value**: 0.00\n- **End Value**: 10710.07\n\nNow we can present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '10710.07'}}\n```",
