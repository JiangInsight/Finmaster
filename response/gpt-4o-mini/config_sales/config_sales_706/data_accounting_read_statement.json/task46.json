(Here, the negative sign shows cash outflow.)\n   - There are no other cash inflows from receipts of dividends or interest in the provided statement.\n\n3. **Final Value Calculation:**\n   - The overall net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets corresponds to the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**, which is **-352857.55**.\n\n4. **Decomposing into Sub-items:**\n   - Since there's only one main line item that fits our criteria, we treat the **Purchase of Fixed Assets** as a sub-item:\n     - **Sub-item Value**: 352857.55\n\nThis leads us directly to the final structured response.\n\nHere is the JSON formatted response as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-352857.55', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '352857.55'} }\n```",
