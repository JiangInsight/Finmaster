In the balance sheet provided:\n   ```\n   | Taxes Payable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 290671.05 | 2024-01-28 |\n   ```\n   - The end amount of taxes payable is **290671.05**.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**: This statement provides insight into the changes in tax liability. It includes:\n   ```\n   | Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable | 290671.05 | 2024-01-28 |\n   ```\n   This indicates that there has been an increase in tax payable, which reinforces the figure found in the balance sheet.\n\n3. **Income Statement**: The line item for tax expense directly shows:\n   ```\n   | Tax Expense | 290671.05 | 2024-01-28 |\n   ```\n   This also confirms the tax amount that the entity is expected to pay.\n\nAll three documents consistently show that the total amount of tax expense for the reporting period is **290671.05**.\n\nThus, combining this data, we conclude that the expected total amount of tax to be paid is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '290671.05'} }\n```",
