In this case, we assume the initial accounts receivable is zero based on the information given in the balance sheet context.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Transactions**: We need to extract all transactions that impact accounts receivable. This includes:\n   - Sales transactions where payment has not been received.\n   - Interest receivables which also contribute to accounts receivable.\n\n3. **Calculate the End Value**: For the accounts receivable, we will sum up the `amount` for all unpaid sales and interest receivables at the end of the period.\n\n### Transactions Analysis\n\nBased on the provided data, we will extract the necessary information:\n\n- **Sales Entries Contributing to Accounts Receivable** (unpaid sales):\n    - Sale20240103006: 17983.04 (unpaid)\n    - Sale20240114046: 9378.67 (unpaid)\n    - Sale20240115050: 8654.65 (unpaid)\n    - Sale20240116055: 73421.4 (unpaid)\n    - Sale20240116056: 75197.88 (unpaid)\n    - Sale20240119070: 37955.84 (unpaid)\n    - Sale20240120073: 76630.94 (unpaid)\n    - Sale20240122080: 257505.69 (unpaid)\n    - Sale20240125094: 105017.58 (unpaid)\n    - Sale20240126103: 9865.43 (unpaid)\n    - Sale20240128110: 38693.93 (paid but not counted)\n    - Sale20240128111: 51298.56 (paid but not counted)\n    - Sale20240123087: 17076.87 (unpaid)\n\n\n- **Interest Receivables**:\n    - Interest20240101001: 445.0 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240102002: 441.44 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240103003: 441.44 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240104004: 437.435 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240105005: 416.075 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240106006: 416.075 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240107007: 416.075 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240108008: 416.075 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240109009: 416.075 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240110010: 416.075 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240111011: 416.075 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240112012: 371.575 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240113013: 371.575 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240114014: 371.575 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240115015: 366.23499999999996 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240116016: 366.23499999999996 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240117017: 366.23499999999996 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240118018: 366.23499999999996 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240119019: 366.23499999999996 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240120020: 366.23499999999996 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240121021: 366.23499999999996 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240122022: 366.23499999999996 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240123023: 334.83067805 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240124024: 334.83067805 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240125025: 334.83067805 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240126026: 334.83067805 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240127027: 324.15067805 (unpaid)\n    - Interest20240128028: 324.15067805 (unpaid)\n\n### Calculating the Total\n\nNow, summing all unpaid sales and interests:\n\n1. **Unpaid sales total**:\n   - 17983.04 + 9378.67 + 8654.65 + 73421.4 + 75197.88 + 37955.84 + 76630.94 +\n   257505.69 + 105017.58 + 9865.43 + 17076.87 = 499121.26\n\n2. **Interest receivables total**:\n   - 445.0 + 441.44 + 441.44 + 437.435 + 416.075 + 416.075 + 416.075 + 416.075 +\n   416.075 + 416.075 + 416.075 + 371.575 + 371.575 + 371.575 + 366.23499999999996 +\n   366.23499999999996 + 366.23499999999996 + 366.23499999999996 + 366.23499999999996 +\n   334.83067805 + 334.83067805 + 334.83067805 + 324.15067805 + 324.15067805 = 9067.295\n\n3. **Total Accounts Receivable End Value**:\n   - Total = Unpaid sales + Interest receivables = 499121.26 + 9067.295 = 508188.555\n\nThus, at the end of the period:\n- Initial Accounts Receivable Value: **0.00**\n- End Accounts Receivable Value: **508188.55**\n\nFinally, putting this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Receivable End Value': '508188.55'} }\n```",
