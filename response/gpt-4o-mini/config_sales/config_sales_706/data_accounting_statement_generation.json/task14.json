In this dataset, the transactions related to purchase and expenses that are unpaid or recorded in the \"Account Payable\" category will be considered for current liabilities.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Initial Current Liabilities\n1. **Initial Current Liabilities** are found from the existing account payables or unpaid purchases on the date 2023-12-31.\n2. For the year ending 2023-12-31:\n   - There are three purchases marked as unpaid:\n     - `Purchase20231231001`: Amount = 180000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231002`: Amount = 150000.0\n     - `Purchase20231231003`: Amount = 350000.0\n     - All these purchases will contribute to the initial liabilities.\n\n### Step 3: Sum up initial current liabilities\n- Initial Current Liabilities = 180000 + 150000 + 350000 = **680000.0**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Final Current Liabilities\n1. **Final Current Liabilities** at the last transaction (2024-01-30):\n   - We need to sum up any **unpaid purchases** or **unpaid expenses** up to the last recorded transaction date.\n   - From the data, there are multiple purchases and expenses:\n     - The account payable purchases that remain unpaid throughout the current liabilities period:\n       - `Purchase20231231004`: Amount = 350000.0\n       - `Purchase20231231008`: Amount = 400000.0\n       - `Purchase20231231010`: Amount = 350000.0\n       - `Purchase20231231012`: Amount = 400000.0\n     - These should be noted and summed.\n\n### Step 5: Sum up final current liabilities\n- Final Current Liabilities = 180000 + 150000 + 350000 + 400000 + 350000 + 400000 = **1870000.0**\n\n### Step 6: Prepare the final output\nThus, the totals are:\n- Total Current Liabilities Initial Value: **680000.0**\n- Total Current Liabilities Final Value: **1870000.0**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '680000.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '1870000.00'}}\n```",
