Non-current assets mainly include fixed assets and any associated purchases or depreciation.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Initial Total Non-current Assets\nFrom the initial data, we can see:\n- Cash deposit: 3,000,000.0\n- Bank deposit: 5,000,000.0\n- Fixed Assets (initial): 5,000,000.0\n\nThe initial total for non-current assets would be the value of fixed assets:\n\\[ \\text{Initial Total Non-current Assets} = 5,000,000.0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Adjustments to Non-current Assets\nWe need to calculate the effect of any purchases and depreciation that affect our total non-current assets after the initial value.\n\n**Purchases and their amounts:**\n1. Purchase (2023-12-31) for $180,000.0\n2. Purchase (2023-12-31) for $40,000.0\n3. Purchase (2023-12-31) for $150,000.0\n4. Purchase (2023-12-31) for $250,000.0  _(Related to fixed assets purchases)_\n5. Additional purchases listed also include Fixed Asset purchases which I will sum up separately.\n\n**Total Purchases effect:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Purchases} = 180,000.0 + 40,000.0 + 150,000.0 + 250,000.0 = 620,000.0 \n\\]\n\n**Depreciation:**\n- Depreciation on 2024-01-01 is $45,749.759999999995\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Final Total Non-current Assets\nAdding the total purchases to the initial value of non-current assets and then subtracting depreciation:\n\\[ \n\\text{Final Total Non-current Assets} = 5,000,000.0 + 620,000.0 - 45,749.76 \n\\]\n\\[ \n\\text{Final Total Non-current Assets} = 5,000,000.0 + 620,000.0 - 45,749.76 = 5,574,250.24 \n\\]\n\n### Summary of Calculations\n\n- **Total Non-current Assets Initial Value**: 5,000,000.0\n- **Total Non-current Assets End Value**: 5,574,250.24\n\n### Final Solution\nNow, let's present our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5574250.24'} }\n```",
