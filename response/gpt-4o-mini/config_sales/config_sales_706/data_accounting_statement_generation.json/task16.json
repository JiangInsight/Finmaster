Identify the initial entries that contribute to the paid-in capital:\n   - Cash Deposit: **3,000,000.0**\n   - Bank Deposit: **5,000,000.0**\n   - Fixed Assets (Asset Purchase): **5,000,000.0**\n   \nTo calculate the **Initial Paid-in Capital**:\n- Initial Paid-in Capital = Cash Deposit + Bank Deposit + Fixed Assets \n- Initial Paid-in Capital = 3,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 + 5,000,000.0 = 13,000,000.0\n\nNext, we need to check for any additional paid-in capital or any reductions during the given time:\n\n2. After analyzing the transactions, there were no new capital contributions or withdrawals listed that would impact the paid-in capital after the initial setup.\n\nThus, the **Final Paid-in Capital** remains the same as the initial:\n\n- Final Paid-in Capital = Initial Paid-in Capital = 13,000,000.0\n\nFinally, we will format the results in the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
