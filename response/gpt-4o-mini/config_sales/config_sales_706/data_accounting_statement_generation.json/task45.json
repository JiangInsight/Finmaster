These include purchases of fixed assets and investments.\n\nWe'll go through the data and look for transactions relevant to:\n\n1. **Purchases of Fixed Assets** (cash outflows)\n2. **Sales of Fixed Assets** (cash inflows)\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Transactions:**\n   - The relevant transactions that qualify as investing activities typically involve fixed asset purchases and sales.\n\n2. **Categorize Transactions:**\n   - We need to find the purchases and fixed asset costs, focusing primarily on transactions with types that indicate investment, such as \"Fixed Assets\" and associated purchases.\n\n### Calculated Transactions\n\n- The following transactions help in calculating net cash flows from investing activities:\n\n| id                          | type                        | amount     | recorded_amount   |   |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|-------------------|---|\n| FixedAsset20231231001      | Fixed Assets Purchase       | 352857.55  | 352857.55         | Cash Outflow |\n| Purchase20231231002        | Purchase                    | 40000.0    | 40000.0           | Cash Outflow |\n| Purchase20231231003        | Purchase                    | 150000.0   | 150000.0          | Cash Outflow |\n| Purchase20231231004        | Purchase                    | 350000.0   | 350000.0          | Cash Outflow |\n| Purchase20231231005        | Purchase                    | 45000.0    | 45000.0           | Cash Outflow |\n| Purchase20231231006        | Purchase                    | 140000.0   | 140000.0          | Cash Outflow |\n| Purchase20231231007        | Purchase                    | 100000.0   | 100000.0          | Cash Outflow |\n| Purchase20231231008        | Purchase                    | 25000.0    | 25000.0           | Cash Outflow |\n| Purchase20231231009        | Purchase                    | 80000.0    | 80000.0           | Cash Outflow |\n| Purchase20231231010        | Purchase                    | 60000.0    | 60000.0           | Cash Outflow |\n| FixedAsset20231231001      | Fixed Assets Purchase       | 352857.55  | 352857.55         | Cash Outflow |\n\n### Total Cash Flows Calculation:\n\n- **Total Cash Outflows for Investments:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cash Outflows} = 352857.55 + 40000 + 150000 + 350000 + 45000 + 140000 + 100000 + 25000 + 80000 + 60000\n\\]\n- Therefore,\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cash Outflows} = 352857.55 + 40000 + 150000 + 350000 + 45000 + 140000 + 100000 + 25000 + 80000 + 60000 = 1313902.55\n\\]\n\n### Final Calculation:\nSince all these amounts represent cash outflows, the Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities will be represented as a negative value.\n\n### Formatting the Solution:\nThe final solution in the requested JSON format is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-1313902.55'} }\n```",
