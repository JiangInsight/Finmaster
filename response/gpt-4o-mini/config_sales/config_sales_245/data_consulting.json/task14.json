                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Formula**: \n   The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify Total Net Credit Sales**:\n   In this case, the Total Revenue is a good proxy for Total Net Credit Sales since we have no explicit details about credit sales. According to the income statement:\n   - Total Revenue = 5,991,764.34\n\n3. **Calculate Average Accounts Receivable**:\n   We are given the ending balance of Accounts Receivable. However, we also need the beginning balance from the balance sheet.\n\n   - Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00 (as provided in the balance sheet)\n   - Ending Accounts Receivable = 1,133,414.13 (as provided in the balance sheet)\n\n   We can calculate Average Accounts Receivable as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{0.00 + 1,133,414.13}{2} = \\frac{1,133,414.13}{2} = 566,707.065\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**:\n   Now that we have both Total Net Credit Sales and Average Accounts Receivable:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,991,764.34}{566,707.065} \\approx 10.58\n   \\]\n\n5. **Format the answer**: \n   We present the result formatted in JSON as required.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '10.58'} }\n```",
