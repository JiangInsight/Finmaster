                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need to determine two elements: the cash flow from operating activities and the total debt. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, we find the net cash flow from operating activities:\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**:  \n  Cash flow: **215423.24** \n\n### Step 2: Determine Total Debt\n\nTo find the total debt, we look at total liabilities on the balance sheet. This typically includes current liabilities and long-term debt. For this problem, it appears that the balance sheet provides total current liabilities, which we will assume as representing total liabilities (since there are no indications of long-term debt present).\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**: 825000.00\n2. **Taxes Payable**: 299588.25\n\nAdding these together:\n- **Total Current Liabilities** (Total Debt) = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable  \nTotal Debt = 825000.00 + 299588.25 = **1124588.25**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nThe formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{215423.24}{1124588.25} \\]\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} \\approx 0.1917 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Format the Ratio\n\nTo give a final answer, we will represent this in three decimal places, keeping negative or positive signs in mind, but here it does not apply.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNow, we can present the result in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.19'}}\n```",
