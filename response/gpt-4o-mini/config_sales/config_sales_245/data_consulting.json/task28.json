                        "content": "To analyze the financial statements and calculate the requested ratios, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio Calculation**:\n   - Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated as Total Liabilities divided by Total Assets.\n\n2. **Gross Profit Margin Calculation**:\n   - Gross Profit Margin is calculated as Gross Profit divided by Total Revenue, expressed as a percentage.\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio Calculation**:\n   - Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated as Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities divided by Total Current Liabilities.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n**1. Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   - From the balance sheet:\n     - Total Assets = 15,288,131.32\n     - Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25 (since no long-term liabilities are mentioned)\n   - Formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{1,124,588.25}{15,288,131.32}\n   \\]\n   - Calculating this gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} \\approx 0.0736\n   \\]\n   - Converting to four decimal places:\n   - \\( \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = 0.0736 \\)\n\n**2. Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - From the income statement:\n     - Gross Profit = 2,741,764.34\n     - Total Revenue = 5,991,764.34\n   - Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{2,741,764.34}{5,991,764.34}\\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   - Calculating this gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit Margin} \\approx 45.7\\%\n   \\]\n\n**3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - From the cash flow statement:\n     - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 215,423.24\n     - Total Current Liabilities = 1,124,588.25\n   - Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{215423.24}{1124588.25}\n   \\]\n   - Calculating this gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} \\approx 0.1915\n   \\]\n\n### Final Ratios:\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: \\(0.0736\\)\n- Gross Profit Margin: \\(45.7\\%\\)\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: \\(0.1915\\)\n\n### JSON Output:\nNow presenting the final results in the desired JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.0736', 'Gross Profit Margin': '45.7%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '0.1915'} }\n```",
