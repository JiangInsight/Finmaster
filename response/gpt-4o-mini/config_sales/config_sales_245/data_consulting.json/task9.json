                        "content": "To compute the Cash to Current Debt Ratio, we need to follow a few steps using the provided financial data. This ratio assesses the proportion of cash and cash equivalents to current liabilities, indicating the company's ability to cover its short-term debt obligations.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Cash and Cash Equivalents\nFrom the cash flow statement, the ending cash balance is given as:\n- **Ending Cash Balance** = 8,215,423.24\n\n### Step 2: Identify Current Liabilities\nFrom the balance sheet, we need to sum the current liabilities to find the total current debt. We can identify these from the current liabilities section:\n- **Accounts Payable**: 825,000.00\n- **Taxes Payable**: 299,588.25\n\nSo, the total current liabilities (current debt) can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Current Liabilities} = \\text{Accounts Payable} + \\text{Taxes Payable}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total Current Liabilities} = 825,000.00 + 299,588.25 = 1,124,588.25\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Cash to Current Debt Ratio\nThe Cash to Current Debt Ratio is determined by dividing the cash (cash and cash equivalents) by the total current liabilities:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Ending Cash Balance}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} = \\frac{8,215,423.24}{1,124,588.25}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Performing the Calculation\nCalculating the above division gives:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} \\approx 7.31\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Round the Result\nFor presentation, we typically round this value. However, since it significantly exceeds 1, it indicates a robust capacity to cover current liabilities. Thus, our final ratio will be represented without needing extra decimal places for clarity.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe calculated ratio will be expressed as a simple value in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '7.31'}}\n```",
