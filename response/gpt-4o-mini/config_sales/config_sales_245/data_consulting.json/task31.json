                        "content": "To calculate the required financial ratios, we will gather necessary figures from the financial statements provided and then apply the appropriate formulas. Here are the necessary calculations step by step:\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\nThe formula for the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is:\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n**Total Revenue:** 5,991,764.34 (from the Income Statement)\n\n**Accounts Receivable:**\n- End amount: 1,133,414.13 (from the Balance Sheet)\n\nAssuming beginning accounts receivable was 0 (as it was not provided), thus:\n\\[ \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 1,133,414.13}{2} = 566,707.065 \\]\n\nNow, substituting the values:\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover} = \\frac{5,991,764.34}{566707.065} \\approx 10.58 \\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nThe formula for this ratio is:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n**Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** 215,423.24 (from the Cash Flow Statement)\n\n**Total Current Liabilities:** 1,124,588.25 (from the Balance Sheet)\n\nNow substituting the values:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities} = \\frac{215,423.24}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 0.19 \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nThe formula for the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nUsing the same figures as above, we find:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{215,423.24}{1,124,588.25} \\approx 0.19 \\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\nThe formula for the Total Asset Turnover Ratio is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n**Total Assets:**\n- End amount: 15,288,131.32 (from the Balance Sheet)\n\nAssuming beginning total assets were 13,000,000 (as it was given in the initial balance sheet), thus:\n\\[ \\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{13,000,000 + 15,288,131.32}{2} = 14,144,065.66 \\]\n\nNow substituting the values:\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover} = \\frac{5,991,764.34}{14,144,065.66} \\approx 0.42 \\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nThe formula for the Debt to Equity Ratio is:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Owner's Equity}} \\]\n\n**Total Liabilities:** 1,124,588.25 (from the Balance Sheet)\n\n**Total Owner's Equity:** 14,163,543.07 (from the Balance Sheet)\n\nNow substituting the values:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,124,588.25}{14,163,543.07} \\approx 0.08 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNow that we have calculated all the required ratios:\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = 10.58\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio = 0.19\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio = 0.19\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio = 0.42\n- Debt to Equity Ratio = 0.08\n\nFormatting the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '10.58', 'operating cash flow ratio': '0.19', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.19', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.42', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08'} }\n```",
