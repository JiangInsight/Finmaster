In this case, we look at the **end amount of the previous balance sheet**, which is relevant before the current end date (which is not provided here but typically would be from the last fiscal period). Since we do not have that data explicitly, we consider the Initial Amount of Inventory:\n   - **Beginning Inventory** = 0.00 (as per the initial balance until the year-end)\n\n2. **Ending Inventory**: From the balance sheet, the ending inventory is:\n   - **Ending Inventory** = 975,000.00\n\nSo, average inventory is:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{0 + 975000}{2} = 487500.00\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThe Inventory Turnover Ratio is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3250000}{487500} \\approx 6.67\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Present the Solution\nNow that we have calculated the Inventory Turnover Ratio, we can format our answer as instructed:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '6.67'} }\n```",
