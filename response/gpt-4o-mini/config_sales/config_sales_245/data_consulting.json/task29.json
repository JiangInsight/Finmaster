                        "content": "To solve this financial problem, we need to calculate four key financial ratios: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, Return on Assets (ROA), and Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio. We will extract the relevant information from the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.\n\n### Step 1: Debt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated as Total Liabilities divided by Total Equity.\n\n1. **Total Assets**: From the balance sheet, the End_amount for Total Assets is 15,288,131.32.\n2. **Total Liabilities**: Total Liabilities can be derived from the Total Assets minus Total Owner's Equity.\n   - Total Owner's Equity: 14,163,543.07\n   - Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner’s Equity = 15,288,131.32 - 14,163,543.07 = 1,124,588.25\n3. **Total Equity**: This is just the Total Owner’s Equity, which is 14,163,543.07.\n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Equity}} = \\frac{1,124,588.25}{14,163,543.07} \\approx 0.0794\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Net Profit Margin\nNet Profit Margin is calculated as Net Profit divided by Total Revenue.\n\n1. **Net Profit**: From the income statement, the Net Profit is 1,163,543.07.\n2. **Total Revenue**: Total Revenue is also from the income statement and is 5,991,764.34.\n3. **Net Profit Margin**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} = \\frac{1,163,543.07}{5,991,764.34} \\approx 0.1942 \\text{ or } 19.42\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Return on Assets (ROA)\nReturn on Assets (ROA) is calculated as Net Profit divided by Total Assets.\n\n1. **Total Assets**: As calculated above, Total Assets = 15,288,131.32.\n2. **Return on Assets (ROA)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{1,163,543.07}{15,288,131.32} \\approx 0.0762 \\text{ or } 7.62\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is calculated as Total Revenue divided by Average Accounts Receivable. We'll assume that the Accounts Receivable at the start of the period is 0 for simplicity.\n\n1. **End Accounts Receivable**: 1,133,414.13 (from balance sheet).\n2. **Average Accounts Receivable**: \n   - Initial Accounts Receivable = 0.\n   - Average = (0 + 1,133,414.13) / 2 = 566,707.065.\n3. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} = \\frac{5,991,764.34}{566,707.065} \\approx 10.56\n   \\]\n\n### Final Calculation and Formatting\nNow we compile the calculated values into the required format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.08', 'Net Profit Margin': '19.42%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '7.62%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '10.56'}}\n```",
