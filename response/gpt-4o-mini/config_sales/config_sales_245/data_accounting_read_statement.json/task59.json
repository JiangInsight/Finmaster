This is usually represented as \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n   - The relevant line item is:\n     - Net Increase: 215423.24\n\nBased on our findings, we will format the solution. The interest accrued but not yet received is represented by `value1`, and the net increase in cash and cash equivalents during the period is represented by `value2`.\n\nNow let's prepare the final output.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10051.66', 'value2': '215423.24'} }\n```",
