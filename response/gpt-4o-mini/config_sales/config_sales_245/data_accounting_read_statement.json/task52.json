Here are the details from the balance sheet provided:\n\n- **Paid-in Capital**\n  - Initial Amount: 13000000.00\n  - Initial Date: 2023-12-31\n  - End Amount: 13000000.00\n  - End Date: 2024-01-29\n\nFrom this information, we can observe the following:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: This is the amount of capital contributed by shareholders as of the initial date (2023-12-31), which is **13,000,000.00**.\n2. **End Value**: This is the amount of capital contributed by shareholders as of the end date (2024-01-29), which remains the same at **13,000,000.00**.\n\nSince the Paid-in Capital did not change over this period, both the initial and end values are the same.\n\nNow we can present this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
