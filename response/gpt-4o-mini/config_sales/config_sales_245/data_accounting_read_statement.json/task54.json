COGS is the most appropriate figure for the task at hand.\n\n5. **Format the Response**:\n   - The extracted value from the COGS that signifies the costs incurred in delivering services and securing customer orders is enclosed within the specified JSON format.\n\nTherefore, the solution is structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3250000.00'} }\n```",
