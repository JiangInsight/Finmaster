                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify and extract three specific line items from the provided financial statements:\n\n1. **Profit Before Tax** from the Income Statement\n2. **Addition in Accounts Payable** from the Cash Flow Statement (this represents the increase in amount owed for goods/services received on credit)\n3. **Paid-in Capital** from the Balance Sheet (this represents capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares)\n\nNow let's analyze each of the statements step-by-step to find the desired values.\n\n### 1. Extracting from the Balance Sheet\n**Line Item: Paid-in Capital**\n- The entry for \"Paid-in Capital\" is: \n  - End Amount: `13000000.00`\n\n### 2. Extracting from the Income Statement\n**Line Item: Profit Before Tax**\n- The entry for \"Profit Before Tax\" is: \n  - Amount: `1463131.32`\n\n### 3. Extracting from the Cash Flow Statement\n**Line Item: Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**\n- The entry for \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is:\n  - Amount: `825000.00` (since this reflects an increase, it is the addition in the amount owed)\n\n### Compiling the Results\nNow that we have all the necessary values, we can structure them as follows:\n- Value 1 (Paid-in Capital) = `13000000.00`\n- Value 2 (Profit Before Tax) = `1463131.32`\n- Value 3 (Increase in Accounts Payable) = `825000.00`\n\n### Formulating the Solution\nNow, we can format the results into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1463131.32', 'value3': '825000.00'} }\n``` \n\nThis reflects the values extracted from the financial statements in the specified order.",
