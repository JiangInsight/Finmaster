We need to identify the specific line item related to tax and determine its value.\n\nLooking at the provided information, the relevant section from the income statement is as follows:\n\n- Tax Expense | 299588.25 | 2024-01-29\n\nThe line item labeled \"Tax Expense\" gives us the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period. There is no other line item related to tax included in the statement, which means we can conclude that this is the only figure we need.\n\nNow, let's extract the value of the tax expense:\n\n- Value of tax expense = 299588.25\n\nThus, we can present our answer in the required JSON format. Now we will write the answer in the specified format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '299588.25'} }\n```",
