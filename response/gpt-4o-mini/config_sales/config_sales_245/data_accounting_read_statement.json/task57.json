The relevant line items for liabilities typically include \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\" from the balance sheet, as these indicate obligations for purchases or expenses incurred.\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**: This line shows how much the entity owes to suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit. In the balance sheet, the \"End_amount\" for \"Accounts Payable\" is provided as 825,000.00.\n\n2. **Taxes Payable**: This line reflects amounts owed in taxes, which can also be seen as obligations incurred during the business operations. The \"End_amount\" for \"Taxes Payable\" is 299,588.25.\n\nNext, we sum both accounts to find the total liabilities related to credit purchases:\n\n- Accounts Payable: **825,000.00**\n- Taxes Payable: **299,588.25**\n  \nTotal amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit:\n- **825000.00 (Accounts Payable) + 299588.25 (Taxes Payable) = 1124588.25**\n\nThus, the critical line item to report as the value of the total amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit during the period is **1,124,588.25**.\n\nNow, we format the final answer as required.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1124588.25'} }\n```",
