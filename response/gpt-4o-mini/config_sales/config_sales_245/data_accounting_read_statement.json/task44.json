We start by locating the section labeled \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" which typically lists the balances associated with this account.\n2. Within that section, we look for the line item \"Ending Balance,\" which represents the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period.\n3. From the provided data, the \"Ending Balance\" line shows an amount of **8215423.24**.\n\nNow we format this as required in the JSON solution structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8215423.24'} }\n```",
