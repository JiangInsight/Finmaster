The relevant section for tax payable is within the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\".\n\n2. **Look for the Tax Payable Line Item**: In the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, we need to find the line item that refers specifically to tax payable. In our case, the item is labeled as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\".\n\n3. **Extract the Amount**: The value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" is provided as 299588.25.\n\nSince there are no issues with the formatting or presentation of the data, we can directly format our solution.\n\nHere's the extracted value placed into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '299588.25'} }\n```",
