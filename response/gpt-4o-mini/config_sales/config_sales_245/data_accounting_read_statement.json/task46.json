We are also interested in the receipt of interest and dividends.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, the important sections are:\n\n**Cash Flow from Investing Activities:**\n- The line item relevant to our task is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is listed as follows:\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00\n\nThis indicates that there were no cash outflows related to the purchase of fixed assets during the reporting period.\n\nNow, we also need to look for other investments not mentioned directly but possibly included or inferred under investing activities. However, in this case, there are no other line items given for the disposal of long-term assets or investments that generated cash flow.\n\nFor the receipt of interest and dividends, there isnâ€™t any line item related to this in the provided cash flow statement as well.\n\nNow we summarize the findings:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities** is -0.00 from the investing section.\n- **Components from the statement** indicate that there are no sub-items with positive values related to cash inflows from other investments or cash receipts from interest/dividends.\n\nAs such, the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from these activities is:\n- Total = -0.00 (as no cash was acquired)\n- Sub-item = 0.00 (from the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\").\n\nBased on the analysis, the final response in the stipulated format would look as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'}} \n```",
