The key line item that typically represents these costs is the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), as it directly relates to the expenses associated with producing and delivering products to customers.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: Review the income statement for items that relate to costs of securing orders or delivering goods/services.\n   - The significant line item identified is:\n     - **Cost of Goods Sold** (COGS): This reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company.\n\n2. **Extract the Values**: \n   - From the income statement, we find:\n     - COGS = 3,250,000.00\n\n3. **Conclusion**: As the task specifically asks for the value of costs incurred to secure and deliver customer orders, we will extract the value associated with COGS.\n\nNow, we present the identified value in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3250000.00'} }\n```",
