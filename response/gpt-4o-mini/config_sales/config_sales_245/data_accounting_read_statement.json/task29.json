In this case, we only have one relevant component that matches:\n     - \"Main Business Revenue\" with a value of 5991764.34.\n\n4. **Initial and Final Values**:\n   - For the sub-item \"Main Business Revenue\":\n     - Initial and Final Values: both are 5991764.34.\n\nNow we can format this information into the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5991764.34', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '5991764.34'}}\n```",
