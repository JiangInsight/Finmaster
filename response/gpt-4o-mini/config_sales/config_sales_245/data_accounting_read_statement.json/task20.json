This is generally represented as \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\nLooking at the provided income statement:\n\n```\n| Account                  | Amount       | Date       |\n| ------------------------ | ------------ | ---------- |\n| Main Business Revenue    | 5991764.34  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Revenue            | 5991764.34  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold       | 3250000.00  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Cost               | 3250000.00  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Gross Profit             | 2741764.34  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Administrative Expenses   | 269591.31   | 2024-01-29 |\n| Selling Expenses         | 782775.93   | 2024-01-29 |\n| Depreciation            | 45757.71    | 2024-01-29 |\n| Financial Expenses       | 190559.73   | 2024-01-29 |\n| Total Expenses           | 1288684.68  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Interest Income          | 10051.66    | 2024-01-29 |\n| Profit Before Tax        | 1463131.32  | 2024-01-29 |\n| Tax Expense              | 299588.25   | 2024-01-29 |\n| Net Profit               | 1163543.07  | 2024-01-29 |\n```\n\nThe line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" has a value of **3250000.00** which corresponds to the total cost of inventories sold during the reporting period. Given that this is the only relevant line item regarding inventories sold, we can present the answer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3250000.00'} }\n```",
