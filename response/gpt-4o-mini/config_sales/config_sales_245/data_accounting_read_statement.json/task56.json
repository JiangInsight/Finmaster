This indicates a consistent calculation of depreciation across the financial statements.\n\n4. **Present the Solution**:\n   - Since the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is reflected by the depreciation value, we can represent this value in the required JSON format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45757.71'} }\n```",
