The amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period, which is typically reflected in \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\"\n2. Acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, commonly found under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n3. Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period, known as \"Beginning Balance.\"\n\nNow, letâ€™s identify these specific line items and their corresponding values from the provided cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable:**\n   - Line Item: \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\"\n   - Value: **825000.00**\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets:**\n   - Line Item: \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"\n   - Value: **0.00**\n\n3. **Beginning Balance:**\n   - Line Item: \"Beginning Balance\"\n   - Value: **8000000.00**\n\nWith these values identified, we summarize them into the required JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '825000.00', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
