However, for the purpose of identifying the carrying amount of the inventories sold specifically indicated in the cash flow statement, we should take the amount that reflects the decrease of inventory reported:\n\n- Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period (from cash flow analysis) is **975000.00**.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe will present this value in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '975000.00'} }\n```",
