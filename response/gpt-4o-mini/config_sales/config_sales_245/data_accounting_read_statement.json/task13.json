This typically includes fixed assets and possibly other long-term assets.\n\nWe will analyze the balance sheet provided in the \"problem\":\n\n1. **Identifying Line Items**:\n   - **Fixed Assets**: These are generally considered non-current assets and are typically not intended for sale or consumption in the short term. The value for fixed assets is:\n     - Initial Amount: 5000000.00\n     - End Amount: 5000000.00\n\n   - **Total Non-current Assets**: This category includes all non-current or long-term assets. The value for total non-current assets is:\n     - Initial Amount: 5000000.00\n     - End Amount: 4954242.29\n\n2. **Determining the Relevant Values**:\n   - Since we are interested in fixed assets and total non-current assets, we need to consider these values for our final result. However, fixed assets appear more relevant as they solely represent fixed long-term assets with a stable value.\n\n3. **Identifying Total Assets**: \n   - Total Assets are provided, but since the question specifically asks for line items not intended for sale or consumption in normal course, we will follow the identification for fixed and non-current assets.\n\nNow we will pick the highest relevant category for the solution.\n\n4. **Checking Non-current Assets**:\n   - Total Non-current Assets initial value is 5000000.00 and end value is 4954242.29. This indicates the change and is relevant as well since itâ€™s part of total assets.\n\nGiven these analyses, we will combine the final values of fixed assets as it's typically most indicative of long-term assets. \n\nHere's the solution formatted as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4954242.29'}}\n```",
