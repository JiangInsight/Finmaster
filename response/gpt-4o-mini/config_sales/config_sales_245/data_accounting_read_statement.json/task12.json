                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify the line items from the balance sheet that represent current assets. Current assets are generally expected to be realized or sold within one year or the operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer. They typically include line items such as cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, and other short-term investments.\n\nLet's analyze the provided balance sheet data step by step.\n\n### Extracting Relevant Current Assets\n1. **Cash on Hand**: \n   - Initial Amount: 3,000,000.00\n   - End Amount: 4,560,423.24\n\n2. **Bank Deposits**: \n   - Initial Amount: 5,000,000.00\n   - End Amount: 3,655,000.00\n\n3. **Interest Receivable**: \n   - Initial Amount: 0.00\n   - End Amount: 10,051.66\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable**: \n   - Initial Amount: 0.00\n   - End Amount: 1,133,414.13\n\n5. **Inventory**: \n   - Initial Amount: 0.00\n   - End Amount: 975,000.00\n\nThese five accounts qualify as current assets as they are either cash or will be converted to cash or consumed within the normal operating cycle.\n\n### Total Current Assets Calculation\n- **Total Current Assets Initial Amount**: 8,000,000.00\n- **Total Current Assets End Amount**: 10,333,889.03\n\n### Values for the Solution\n- **Initial Value of Current Assets**: The initial value of total current assets is **8,000,000.00**.\n- **End Value of Current Assets**: The end value of total current assets is **10,333,889.03**.\n\n### Formatting the Solution\nNow we can format our findings into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10333889.03'}}\n```",
