Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Net Profit**: The net profit from the provided income statement is given as:\n   - **Net Profit**: `1163543.07`\n\n2. **Extract Sub-items**: For calculating net profit, we can identify the relevant components:\n   - **Total Revenue**: `5991764.34`\n   - **Total Expenses**: `1288684.68`\n   - **Interest Income**: `10051.66`\n   - **Tax Expense**: `299588.25`\n   - **Administrative Expenses**: `269591.31` (as it's part of total expenses)\n   - **Selling Expenses**: `782775.93` (as it's also part of total expenses)\n\n3. **Determine Values**: \n   - The net profit calculation would typically look like this:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Expenses} + \\text{Interest Income} - \\text{Tax Expense}\n     \\]\n\nUsing the extracted values:\n- Initial values:\n  - Total Revenue: `5991764.34`\n  - Total Expenses: `1288684.68`\n  - Interest Income: `10051.66`\n  - Tax Expense: `299588.25`\n  - (Administrative and Selling Expenses are included but not added separately as they are part of Total Expenses)\n\nNow, we list down the sub-item values in the required format.\n\nHereâ€™s the solution in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1163543.07', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '5991764.34', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '1288684.68', 'sub_items_sub_item value3': '10051.66', 'sub_items_sub_item value4': '299588.25', 'sub_items_sub_item value5': '0.00'}}\n```\n\nNote that '0.00' for the fifth sub-item is included as a placeholder, but all relevant amounts are already covered in the context.",
