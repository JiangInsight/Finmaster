The \"Net Profit\" which indicates the profit retained after all expenses have been deducted from the total revenue.\n2. The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" which reflects cash payments made to acquire long-term assets.\n\nLet's break down the provided cash flow statement:\n\n- The line item for \"Net Profit\" is found in the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section and has an amount of **1163543.07.**\n- The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" and has an amount of **0.00**.\n\nNow, we will format the extracted values according to the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1163543.07', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```",
