This confirms that the interest receivable amount has increased by this value.\n\n3. **Income Statement**:\n   - The \"Interest Income\" account shows an amount of 10051.66 for the date 2024-01-29. This amount represents the interest that was accrued during the period.\n\nNow, we summarize the values for the interest accrued but not yet received:\n- Initial value: 0.00\n- End value: 10051.66\n\nFinally, we can format the extracted values in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '10051.66'}}\n```",
