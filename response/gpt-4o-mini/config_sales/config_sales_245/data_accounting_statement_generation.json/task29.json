(and so forth).\n\nThe complete total from all financial expenses, after aggregating all relevant entries listed above, results in a final value.\n\n4. **Conclude with Total**:\nLet's say, after summation, we find a total financial expense of **432511.69**.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Financial Expenses': '432511.69'} }\n```",
