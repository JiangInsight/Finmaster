                        "content": "To calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) from the provided transactions, we will look for purchase and sale transactions to determine the total cost of items sold during the period.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify Purchases**:\n   From the purchases listed in the data, we will note the amount spent on purchases:\n\n   - Purchase of Premium Product C (10 units x $20,000.0) = $200,000\n   - Purchase of Premium Product D (10 units x $50,000.0) = $500,000\n   - Purchase of Premium Product D (10 units x $50,000.0) = $50,000\n   - Purchase of Premium Product B (7 units x $10,000.0) = $70,000\n   - Purchase of Premium Product D (3 units x $20,000.0) = $60,000\n   - Purchase of Premium Product D (9 units x $50,000.0) = $450,000\n   - Purchase of Premium Product A (7 units x $5,000.0) = $35,000\n   - Purchase of Premium Product D (8 units x $50,000.0) = $400,000\n   - Purchase of Premium Product C (2 units x $50,000.0) = $100,000\n   - Purchase of Premium Product A (7 units x $5,000.0) = $35,000\n   - Purchase of Premium Product C (9 units x $50,000.0) = $450,000\n\n2. **Identify Sales**:\n   Next, we consider the sales to establish how many items out of the inventory have been sold and at what price:\n\n   - Sale of Premium Product C for 1 unit for $39,170.93\n   - Sale of Premium Product C for 2 units for $70,156.46\n   - Sale of Premium Product B for 2 units for $37,948.22\n   - Sale of Premium Product D for 3 units for $256,494.12\n   - Sale of Premium Product D for 3 units for $59,508.81\n  \n3. **Calculate COGS**:\n   - COGS is the total amount spent on purchases that were sold. Based on the sales, we will calculate:\n\n   - Starting from the first recorded purchase:\n     - **Premium Product C**: Total Purchase $200,000 unit cost for 10 units used for sales = 2 units x $20,000 = $40,000.\n     - Premium Product D $500,000: New purchase is 300,000.\n     - Premium Product B 375,000.\n     \n     From the information collected they are all included.\n\n4. **Sum of COGS**:\n   We sum total purchases accounted by sales:\n   \\[\n   COGS = 200,000 + 500,000 + 70,000 + 35,000 + 150,000 + 400,000 + 35,000 = 1,445,000\n   \\]\n   \n   Repeating for all the checks you'll get more consistent and appropriate numbers.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   The running total cost of goods sold is summed up for the purchase you did.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The total COGS calculated from the above transactions is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '1445000.00'}}\n```",
