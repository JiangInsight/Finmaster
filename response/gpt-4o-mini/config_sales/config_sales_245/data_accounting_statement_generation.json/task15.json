Typically, purchases and unpaid expenses contribute to liabilities.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Liabilities\n- Start with 0 since the initial liabilities value is provided.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Transactions Affecting Liabilities\n1. **Purchases**\n   - Look for purchases marked as \"Unpaid\".\n   - These represent accounts payable.\n\n2. **Expenses**\n   - Administrative or Sales Expenses that are marked as \"Unpaid\" also constitute liabilities since they result in money owed.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Given Data\nWe will check each relevant transaction to identify the unpaid ones.\n\n#### Transactions Overview:\n- **Initial Transactions**: \n  - Cash Deposit - does not affect liabilities\n  - Bank Deposit - does not affect liabilities\n  - Fixed Assets - does not affect liabilities\n\n- **Unpaid Purchases/Expenses**:\n  - **Purchases**:\n    - Purchase20231231001: $200,000 (Unpaid)\n    - Purchase20231231004: $100,000 (Unpaid)\n    - Purchase20231231005: $35,000 (Unpaid)\n    - Purchase20231231009: $50,000 (Unpaid)\n    - Purchase20231231010: $160,000 (Unpaid) \n    - Purchase20231231012: $35,000 (Unpaid)\n\n  - **Expenses**:\n    - None marked as unpaid.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Totals\n- Sum up total unpaid amounts contributing to liabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Liabilities at Initial} = \n200000 (Purchase20231231001) + \n100000 (Purchase20231231004) + \n35000 (Purchase20231231005) + \n50000 (Purchase20231231009) + \n160000 (Purchase20231231010) + \n35000 (Purchase20231231012) \n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n- Total:\n  - 200000 + 100000 + 35000 + 50000 + 160000 + 35000 =  200000 + 100000 + 35000 + 50000 + 160000 + 35000 = 385000\n\n### Summary Results:\n- **Initial Liabilities Value**: 0.00 (as given)\n- **Final Total Liabilities Value**: 385,000.00\n\n### Compile Results\nFinal JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '385000.00'}}\n```",
