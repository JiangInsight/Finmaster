                        "content": "To determine the net cash flow from investing activities, we need to identify and sum the cash flows related to investing. In the provided transactions, cash inflows from investments (like selling fixed assets) and cash outflows related to investments (like purchasing fixed assets) must be considered.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Cash Outflows (Purchases of Fixed Assets)**:\n   The following transactions fall into this category:\n   - **Fixed Assets Purchase**: 5000000.0 (This is a cash outflow since it represents a purchase)\n   - **Purchase**: 500000.0  \n   - **Purchase**: 70000.0\n   - **Purchase**: 100000.0\n   - **Purchase**: 180000.0\n   - **Purchase**: 90000.0\n   - **Purchase**: 140000.0\n   - **Purchase**: 45000.0\n   - **Purchase**: 35000.0\n   - **Purchase**: 120000.0\n   - **Purchase**: 15000.0\n   - **Purchase**: 200000.0 \n\n   The total cash outflows are \\( 5000000 + 500000 + 70000 + 100000 + 180000 + 90000 + 140000 + 45000 + 35000 + 120000 + 15000 + 200000 =  5830000 \\).\n\n2. **Identify Cash Inflows (Sales of Fixed Assets)**:\n   In this dataset, no cash inflows from selling fixed assets are specified. Therefore, we do not add any cash inflow related to investment activities.\n\n3. **Calculate Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   Since there are only cash outflows and no inflows, the net cash flow from investing activities is simply the sum of cash outflows made.\n\n   Thus, the net cash flow is:\n   \\[\n   -5830000.0\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we present the result in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-5830000.0'} }\n```",
