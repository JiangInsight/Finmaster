This statement does not detail any long-term debt or liabilities, therefore:\n- **Total Liabilities** = **Total Current Liabilities** = **628478.02**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThe formula for Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-650630.22}{628478.02} \\approx -1.04\n\\]\n\n### Final Step: Present the Answer in JSON Format\nNow, we can present the result in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.04'} }\n```",
