                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio, we need to extract and compute the necessary values from the provided financial statements.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Relevant Values\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio**\n   - **Total Assets:** We find this from the balance sheet. The value is given as:\n     - Total Assets = 14,534,228.78\n   - **Total Liabilities:** We can determine this by calculating from total assets and total equity:\n     - Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity\n     - Total Owner's Equity = 13,905,750.76\n     - Total Liabilities = 14,534,228.78 - 13,905,750.76 = 628478.02\n\n   Now we will calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{628478.02}{14534228.78}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**\n   - **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:** This is found in the cash flow statement as:\n     - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -650630.22\n   - **Net Income:** We see this in the income statement:\n     - Net Income = 905750.76\n\n   Now we will calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} = \\frac{-650630.22}{905750.76}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Perform Calculations\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{628478.02}{14534228.78} \\approx 0.0433 \\text{ (or '0.04' when rounded to two decimal places)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-650630.22}{905750.76} \\approx -0.7186 \\text{ (or '-0.72' when rounded to two decimal places)}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Format the Results\n\nAfter calculating, we format the results in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-0.72'}}\n```",
