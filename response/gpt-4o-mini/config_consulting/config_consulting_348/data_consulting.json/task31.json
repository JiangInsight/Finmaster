                        "content": "To calculate the required financial ratios, we will utilize the information provided in the financial statements: balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how many times a company collects its average accounts receivable during a period. The formula is:\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\nUsing the cash flow statement, we need to calculate Net Credit Sales from the revenue figure in the income statement. \n\n- Net Credit Sales (Total Revenue) = \\$2,869,560.42\n- Average Accounts Receivable = \\(\\frac{\\text{Beginning Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 2,149,792.45}{2} = 1,074,896.23\\)\n  \nNow we can calculate the turnover ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{2,869,560.42}{1,074,896.23} = 2.67\n\\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio indicates how well current liabilities are covered by cash generated from operations. The formula is:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -\\$650,630.22\n- Total Current Liabilities = \\$628,478.02\n\nCalculating the cash flow ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-650,630.22}{628,478.02} = -1.04\n\\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is a similar concept to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio but emphasizes the relationship to current liabilities.\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = -1.04\n\\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's effectiveness at using its assets to generate sales, calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Sales}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\n- Total Assets (end date) = \\$14,534,228.78\n- Total Assets (initial date) = \\$13,000,000.00\n- Average Total Assets = \\(\\frac{\\text{Beginning Total Assets} + \\text{Ending Total Assets}}{2} = \\frac{13,000,000.00 + 14,534,228.78}{2} = 13,767,114.39\\)\n\nCalculating Total Asset Turnover Ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{2,869,560.42}{13,767,114.39} = 0.21\n\\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n\\]\n\n- Total Liabilities (end date) = \\$628,478.02 (current liabilities only, assuming no long-term debts as none were given)\n- Total Owner's Equity (end date) = \\$13,905,750.76\n\nCalculating Debt to Equity Ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{628,478.02}{13,905,750.76} = 0.05\n\\]\n\n### Final Results\nNow we present the final calculated ratios in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.67', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.04', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.04', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.21', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.05'}}\n```",
