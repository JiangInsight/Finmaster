Total Current Liabilities = 628478.02\n2. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (Operating Cash Flow) = -650630.22\n3. Total Debt (Total Liabilities) = 628478.02 (since it's entirely current liabilities)\n4. Total Equity (Total Owner's Equity) = 13905750.76\n5. Total Assets = 14534228.78\n6. Accounts Receivable = 2149792.45\n7. Net Profit = 905750.76\n8. Total Revenue = 2869560.42\n9. Cost of Goods Sold = 1249000.00\n10. Beginning Cash Balance = 8000000.00 (not directly needed for calculation, but provides context)\n11. Ending Cash Balance = 7349369.78 (not directly needed for calculation, but provides context)\n\n### 1. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**\nThis ratio indicates how well the cash generated from operations covers current liabilities.\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{-650630.22}{628478.02} \\approx -1.04\n\\]\n\n### 2. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\nThis ratio measures the company's financial leverage.\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Equity}} = \\frac{628478.02}{13905750.76} \\approx 0.0452 \\text{ or } 0.045\n\\]\n\n### 3. **Total Asset Turnover Ratio**\nThis ratio reflects the efficiency of a company's use of its assets in generating sales revenue.\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{2869560.42}{14534228.78} \\approx 0.197\n\\]\n\n### 4. **Quick Ratio**\nThis ratio evaluates the ability to meet short-term obligations with the most liquid assets (current assets minus inventories).\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{9625738.03 - 112000}{628478.02} = \\frac{9624738.03}{628478.02} \\approx 15.30\n\\]\n\n### 5. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\nThis ratio highlights the cash flow available to cover current liabilities.\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{-650630.22}{628478.02} \\approx -1.04\n\\]\n\n### 6. **Return on Equity (ROE)**\nROE measures the ability of a firm to generate profits from its shareholders' equity.\n\\[\n\\text{Return on Equity (ROE)} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Equity}} = \\frac{905750.76}{13905750.76} \\approx 0.065 or 6.46\\%\n\\]\n\n### 7. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets.\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Accounts Receivable}} = \\frac{2869560.42}{2149792.45} \\approx 1.33\n\\]\n\n### Summary of Calculations\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -1.04\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.045\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio: 0.197\n- Quick Ratio: 15.30\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -1.04\n- Return on Equity (ROE): 6.46%\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 1.33\n\n### Final JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.04\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.045\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.197\",\n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"15.30\",\n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.04\",\n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"6.46%\",\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"1.33\"\n  }\n}\n```",
