Identify Total Liabilities and Total Owner's Equity from the balance sheet.\n2. Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 1: Extract the necessary figures\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet data:\n\n- Total Liabilities:\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 628478.02 (this is the only liability provided, we will assume there are no long-term liabilities given the data)\n  \n  Hence, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 628478.02\n\n- Total Owner's Equity:\n  - Total Owner's Equity = 13905750.76\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nPlugging the values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{628478.02}{13905750.76}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} \\approx 0.0452\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Provide the solution in the requested format\n\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio can be rounded to four decimal places (if necessary for display), but let's use the calculated result directly.\n\nHere's how the solution will be formatted:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.0452'} }\n```",
