Its fields indicate a recorded profit that contradicts the expected profit derived from the provided sales figures (price, cost, tax).\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the identified entries:\n\n1. **Transaction ID**: Sale20240124036\n   - **Incorrect Fields**:\n     - `recorded_profit`\n   - **Recorded Values**:\n     - `recorded_profit`: 22070.23 (reported)\n   - **Correct Values**:\n     - `Original profit`: 20096.08 (calculated)\n   - **Summary of Discrepancy**: The recorded profit does not match the expected profit calculated based on sales and associated costs.\n\nThus, we present the identified inconsistency as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': '2024-01-24', 'Recorded date': '2024-01-24', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded payment_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original quantity': '5.0', 'Recorded quantity': '5.0', 'Original price': '24295.07', 'Recorded price': '24295.07', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable', 'Original amount': '121475.35', 'Recorded amount': '121475.35', 'Original tax': '6073.77', 'Recorded tax': '6073.77', 'Original profit': '20096.08', 'Recorded profit': '22070.23', 'Original Preparer': 'Supervisor', 'Recorded Preparer': 'Supervisor', 'Original Approver': 'Director', 'Recorded Approver': 'Director', 'id': 'Sale20240124036'}}\n``` \n\nThis JSON output captures the discrepancies effectively, providing a detailed overview of the inconsistency identified in the records.",
