                        "content": "To calculate the total liabilities from the provided transaction data, we will focus on identifying transactions that represent liabilities, particularly unpaid purchases andother similar entries indicating financial obligations. Let's go through the data step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Liabilities\nWe look for transactions that are classified as purchases with a payment status of \"Unpaid\" to determine the initial liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\n**Initial Liabilities:**\n- **Purchase20231231001**: 60,000.0 (Unpaid, classified as an account payable)\n- **Purchase20231231004**: 5,000.0 (Unpaid, classified as an account payable)\n- **Purchase20231231006**: 60,000.0 (Unpaid, classified as an account payable)\n- **Purchase20231231010**: 10,000.0 (Unpaid, classified as an account payable)\n- **Purchase20231231014**: 2,000.0 (Unpaid, classified as an account payable)\n- **Purchase20231231022**: 10,000.0 (Unpaid, classified as an account payable)\n\nAdding these amounts together gives us the total initial liabilities:\n\n#### Initial Total Liabilities Calculation:\n\\[\n60,000 + 5,000 + 60,000 + 10,000 + 2,000 + 10,000 = 147,000\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify Final Liabilities\nNext, we will similarly identify transactions that represent liabilities in a more current context, particularly looking for any unpaid liabilities at the end of the recorded data.\n\nThe relevant transactions (only those marked as unpaid) after the initial date include:\n- **Purchase20231231001**: 60,000.0\n- **Purchase20231231006**: 60,000.0\n- **Purchase20231231014**: 2,000.0\n- **Purchase20231231022**: 10,000.0\n- **Purchase20231231002**: 100,000.0 (Unpaid)\n- **Purchase20231231003**: 3,000.0 (Unpaid)\n  \nAdding these together gives us the total final liabilities:\n\n#### Final Total Liabilities Calculation:\n\\[\n60,000 + 60,000 + 2,000 + 10,000 + 100,000 + 3,000 = 235,000\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Format the Result\nThe results can now be formatted as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '147000.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '235000.00'}}\n```\n\nThis JSON object presents the total initial and final liabilities based upon the calculations made from the transaction data provided.",
