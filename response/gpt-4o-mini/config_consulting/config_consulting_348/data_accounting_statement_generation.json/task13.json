                        "content": "To calculate the taxes payable at the beginning and end of the given period, we can analyze the provided transactions step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: The initial value of taxes payable is assumed to be 0.00 since no tax-relevant transactions are recorded before the date 2023-12-31.\n\n2. **Identify Tax Amounts**: We will look for all transactions that have associated `tax_amount`. \n\n3. **Transactions Analysis**:\n   - **Sales transactions** usually have a tax amount associated with them since tax is collected on sales. We need to sum all `tax_amount` for sales transactions.\n   - **Purchases** do not generate tax payable until they are sold or converted into revenue or expenses. Hence, we will not consider them in the tax payable equation directly.\n\n4. **Final Value Calculation**: \n   - We will add together tax amounts from all the sales transactions within the provided data range.\n\n5. **Example Data Assessment**:\n   For instance:\n   - From the provided transactions of sales, the sum of the `tax_amount` column needs to be calculated.\n\nHere's how the analysis is executed:\n\n```json\n{\n \"transaction_data\": [\n {\"tax_amount\": 2118.29 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 10510.19 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 2118.29 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 714.14 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 2897.35 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 103.73 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 600.31 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 489.44 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 2688.52 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 12732.74 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 539.57 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 2076.09 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 11645.83 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 2403.95 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 389.553 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 14228.4 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 2500.0 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 12002.00 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 18273.78 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 10682.14 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 584.88 },\n {\"tax_amount\": 487.124 }\n ]\n}\n```\nIn the analysis, you would sum each of the relevant tax amounts. After going through the transactions, the calculations yield:\n\n- Total tax collected: `271550.92`.\n\n6. **Final Output**: \nThus the total taxes payable after computations are inferred as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Taxes Payable End Value': '271550.92'} }\n```\n\nThe initial balance was zero, and the calculations resulted in an ending balance of 271550.92.",
