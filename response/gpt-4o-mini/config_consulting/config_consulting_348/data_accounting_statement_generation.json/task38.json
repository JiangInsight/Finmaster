This will indicate that those sales were settled, thus reducing accounts receivable.\n3. **Calculate Total Increases and Decreases**:\n   - Sum the total amounts for sales that increase accounts receivable.\n   - Sum the total amount of payments received that decrease accounts receivable.\n4. **Calculate Net Change**: The net change will be the total increases minus total decreases. \n\n### Step by Step Calculation\n\n**Sales (Increases):**\n- Sale20240103002: 42365.71 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240103003: 210203.88 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240105007: 14282.89 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240105008: 57947.08 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240105009: 2074.66 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240106011: 2971.81 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240107013: 2160.53 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240107014: 43879.89 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240115020: 10791.32 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240115021: 41521.81 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240117024: 220256.39 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240117025: 59992.23 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240118028: 57321.13 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240129053: 2994.1 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240129054: 13434.22 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240126044: 52600.07 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240126045: 218551.72 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240131058: 13921.69 (Unpaid)\n- Sale20240131059: 276920.02 (Unpaid)\n\nTotal Increases = \n42365.71 + 210203.88 + 14282.89 + 57947.08 + 2074.66 + 2971.81 + 2160.53 + 43879.89 + 10791.32 + 41521.81 + 220256.39 + 59992.23 + 57321.13 + 2994.1 + 13434.22 + 52600.07 + 218551.72 + 13921.69 + 276920.02 = \n964872.21\n\n**Payments Received (Decreases):**\n- Sale20240106010: 9788.79 (Paid)\n- Sale20240117026: 12449.82 (Paid)\n- Sale20240118029: 254654.8 (Paid)\n- Sale20240119031: 202361.1 (Paid)\n- Sale20240130056: 128279.1 (Paid)\n- Sale20240130057: 74300.25 (Paid)\n\nTotal Payments Received = \n9788.79 + 12449.82 + 254654.8 + 202361.1 + 128279.1 + 74300.25 = \n397833.26\n\n### Calculate the Change in Accounts Receivable\nNow compute the net change in accounts receivable:\n\nTotal Increases - Total Payments Received = \n964872.21 - 397833.26 = 567038.95\n\n### Presenting in Required Format\nNow we present the result in the required JSON format as instructed.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '567038.95'}}\n```",
