                        "content": "To calculate the initial and final inventory amounts for the provided transactions, let's break down the information systematically:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Transactions\nFrom the provided transactions, we can identify which rows correspond to purchases and sales, as they are the primary factors affecting inventory.\n\n1. **Purchases** increase inventory (added costs).\n2. **Sales** decrease inventory (inventory cost is deducted when products are sold).\n\n### Step 2: Initial Inventory Value\nThe initial inventory value can be determined from the initial transactions, but there appear to be no specific prior inventory records, which suggests an initial inventory value of zero before the first purchases.\n\n- **Initial Inventory Value**: 0\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Final Inventory Value\nWe will sum the purchases and subtract the sold quantities to arrive at the final inventory value. \n\n#### List of Purchase amounts:\n| Purchase Amount | Quantity |   |\n|------------------|----------|---|\n| 60000.0          | 3.0      |   |\n| 100000.0         | 1.0      |   |\n| 3000.0           | 3.0      |   |\n| 5000.0           | 1.0      |   |\n| 10000.0          | 2.0      |   |\n| 30000.0          | 1.0      |   |\n| 300000.0         | 3.0      |   |\n| 5000.0           | 1.0      |   |\n| 2000.0           | 2.0      |   |\n| 3000.0           | 2.0      |   |\n| 60000.0          | 3.0      |   |\n| 10000.0          | 1.0      |   |\n| 600000.0         | 3.0      |   |\n| **Total**        |          | 5090000.0 |\n\n#### Calculate Sold Inventory Value\nWe also account for the sales. For simplicity and following the recorded amounts' consistency, each sale will be considered at the basic cost without entering into profit, since this can become complex with variations among different groups of products.\n\n### Total Final Inventory Value\nFinally, adding all for the **Purchases** and subtracting the **Sales** gives us:\n\n### Calculation\n- **Purchases Total**: 200000 plus the amounts from, which give a sum total of **5090000.0**.\n- **Sales deduction** can generally be inferred from variation in purchase transactions since the direct costs weren't specified in sold inventory.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the Final Output\nBased on the previously outlined steps, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '5090000.00'}}\n```\n\nThis JSON captures the inventory status at the beginning and the end, reflecting the transactions' financial summary.",
