                        "content": "To calculate the total non-current assets in the balance sheet based on the transactions provided, we will do the following:\n\n1. **Identify initial non-current assets values from the table.**\n   - From the given data, the initial non-current assets include the following entries:\n     - Fixed Assets (Initial): `5000000.0`\n     - Note that other transactions are not directly adding to non-current assets since they are either expenses or purchases that do not correspond to fixed assets.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Non-current Assets Initial Value:**\n   - Initial Non-current Assets = `5000000.0`\n\n3. **Identify transactions impacting non-current assets in the later part of the table:**\n   - Each transaction related to depreciation will reduce the value of non-current assets.\n   - Investments that increase non-current assets (like purchases of fixed assets) will be added.\n   - We will look for:\n     - Purchases of fixed assets or similar assets.\n     - Depreciation entries.\n\n4. **Parse through the transaction list for relevant adjustments:**\n   - For each purchase leading to non-current assets:\n     - Identify the amount and add it to the total value.\n   - For depreciation entries, we will subtract the value from total non-current assets.\n   - We will accumulate these values to provide an end balance.\n\n5. **List of Relevant Transactions** (limited to those affecting non-current assets):\n   - **Fixed Assets Purchases** - We'll accumulate all fixed assets that are purchases, including:\n     - `\"Purchase20231231001\"`: `60000.0` (Purchase)\n     - `\"Purchase20231231002\"`: `100000.0`\n     - `\"Purchase20231231004\"`: `5000.0`\n     - `\"Purchase20231231009\"`: `20000.0`\n     - `\"Purchase20231231010\"`: `10000.0`\n     - Additional fixed assets purchases if listed.\n   - **Depreciation** - Accumulate all depreciation entries:\n     - `\"Depreciation20240101001\"`: `45756.35`\n     - `\"Depreciation20240201002\"`: `45752.9`\n\n6. **Calculate the total non-current assets adjusted value**:\n   - Total Purchases of Fixed Assets:\n     ```\n     60000.0 (from Purchase20231231001)\n     + 100000.0 (from Purchase20231231002)\n     + 5000.0 (from Purchase20231231004)\n     + 20000.0 (from Purchase20231231009)\n     + 10000.0 (from Purchase20231231010)\n     ```\n   - Subtract total depreciation:\n     ```\n     Total Depreciation = 45756.35 + 45752.9\n     ```\n   - Total non-current assets:\n     ```\n     Total Non-current Assets Initial Value + Total Purchases - Total Depreciation\n     ```\n\nCombining these calculations we derive:\n\n- Initial Amount: `5000000.0`\n- Purchase Amounts: \n  - `60000.0 + 100000.0 + 5000.0 + 20000.0 + 10000.0 = 187000.0`\n- Total Purchases Calculation: \n  ```\n  5000000.0 + 187000 = 5187000.0\n  ```\n- Total Depreciation:\n  ```\n  45756.35 + 45752.9 = 91509.25\n  ```\n- Non-current Assets End Value:\n  ```\n  5187000.0 - 91509.25 = 5095490.75\n  ```\n\nGiven all calculations, the final output will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5095490.75'}}\n```",
