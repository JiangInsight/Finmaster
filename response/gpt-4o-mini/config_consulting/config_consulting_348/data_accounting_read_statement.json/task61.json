In the balance sheet, this would typically be represented by items that contribute to operational assets but here does not seem to apply directly because they relate more to working capital (like Inventory and Accounts Receivable).\n   - The balance sheet does not provide what we are looking for as costs directly.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - We are looking for costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services. This is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the Income Statement:\n     - Cost of Goods Sold: **1249000.00**\n   - The second item we need is for cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment. The Income Statement typically does not include these costs directly since it reflects performance over a period rather than financial position at a point in time.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - We need cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment. This is reflected in the investing section of the Cash Flow Statement:\n     - Purchase of Fixed Assets: **0.00** (no cash outflow for fixed assets acquisition in this case).\n\nNow, combining these findings:\n- From the Income Statement, I have the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" as a relevant cost incurred for delivering goods/services.\n- From the Cash Flow Statement, I note the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" which shows the cash payment related to long-term asset acquisition.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- **value1** (costs incurred to deliver goods and services): 1249000.00\n- **value2** (cash payments to acquire long-term assets): 0.00 \n\nNow, I will structure the solution according to the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1249000.00', 'value2': '0.00'}}\n```",
