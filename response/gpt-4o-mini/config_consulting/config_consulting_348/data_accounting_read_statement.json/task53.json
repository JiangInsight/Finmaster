However, it does not directly show the cost of inventory that was sold.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Analysis**:\n   - The cash flow statement includes an entry for \"Increase\" or \"Decrease in Inventory\" (which is -112,000.00) but this also does not give the total inventory sold.\n\n3. **Income Statement Analysis**:\n   - Looking at the income statement, we find the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item, which states an amount of 1,249,000.00. This figure reflects the cost of inventory that was sold during the reporting period.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is found in the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" section of the income statement.\n\nSo, the extracted value is:\n\n- Value of carrying amount of inventories sold = 1,249,000.00\n\nNow, I will present the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1249000.00'} }\n```",
