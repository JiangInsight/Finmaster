We will also identify and present two relevant component sub-items from the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Line Items**:\n   - We are particularly interested in the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents. This is calculated based on the cash flow activities during the period, which is provided as:\n     - **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -650630.22\n     - **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: -0.00\n\n2. **Calculate the Net Addition in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - The **Beginning Balance** is: 8000000.00\n   - The **Ending Balance** is: 7349369.78\n   - Therefore, the Net Increase (calculated as: Ending Balance - Beginning Balance):\n     \\[\n     7349369.78 - 8000000.00 = -650630.22\n     \\]\n\n3. **Identify Component Sub-Items**:\n   - The two sub-items we can extract directly from the cash flow statement are:\n     - **Beginning Balance**: 8000000.00\n     - **Ending Balance**: 7349369.78\n\n4. **Combine Results**:\n   - The net addition in cash and cash equivalents is -650630.22.\n   - The two components contributing to this are the beginning and ending balances.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\nWe will structure the results in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-650630.22', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '7349369.78'}}\n```",
