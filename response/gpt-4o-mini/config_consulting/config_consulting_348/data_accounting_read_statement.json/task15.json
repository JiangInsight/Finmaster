These typically include Paid-in Capital, Retained Earnings, and Total Owner's Equity.\n\n1. **Identifying the Relevant Line Items:**\n   - Paid-in Capital: \\( 13000000.00 \\)\n   - Retained Earnings: \\( 0.00 \\) at the initial date, \\( 905750.76 \\) at the end date.\n   - Total Owner's Equity: \\( 13000000.00 \\) at the initial date, \\( 13905750.76 \\) at the end date.\n\n2. **Extracting Initial and Final Values:**\n   - Initial Total Owner's Equity: \\( 13000000.00 \\)\n   - End Total Owner's Equity: \\( 13905750.76 \\)\n\n3. **Reviewing Initial and End Values of Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity:**\n   - Using the values already verified, we see that Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity also matches the calculated Total Owner's Equity.\n\nHaving established the values for Total Owner's Equity at both the initial and final date, we can now present the solution.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13905750.76'} }\n```",
