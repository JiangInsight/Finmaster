Identify the relevant section: The cash flow statement consists of multiple sections, with the operating activities section being where tax payables typically fall.\n\n2. Locate the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\": After examining the entries under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\", the line that specifically mentions tax payable is \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\".\n\n3. Extract the value: The amount listed next to the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" entry is `143478.02`.\n\n4. Prepare the response: Based on the identified line item and its value, format the output in the specified JSON structure.\n\nFollowing these steps, I conclude with the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '143478.02'} }\n```",
