Here's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Review the Balance Sheet**: We need to identify any line items that refer to inventory, assets held for sale, or production assets.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: The key line items to examine are:\n   - **Inventory**: This typically includes the goods available for sale in the ordinary course of business.\n   - There are no other line items in this specific balance sheet that explicitly refer to assets held for sale or work-in-progress.\n\n3. **Extract Values**:\n   - For **Inventory**:\n     - **Initial Amount**: The initial value is stated as `0.00`.\n     - **End Amount**: The end value is stated as `112000.00`.\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: According to the specified JSON format, we would place the identified values in the solution field.\n\nNow, putting this together, we arrive at the below JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '112000.00'} }\n```",
