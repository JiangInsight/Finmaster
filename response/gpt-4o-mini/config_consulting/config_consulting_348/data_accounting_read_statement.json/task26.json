Review the \"Financial Expenses\" line:\n   - Here, the \"Financial Expenses\" amount is listed as 50283.07.\n\n2. Since \"Financial Expenses\" typically includes costs like interest on loans and other costs related to financing, this clearly addresses the financing costs incurred by the enterprise.\n\n3. There are no other entries in the income statement that pertain to financing costs distinct from \"Financial Expenses.\"\n\n4. Now we can structure the output in the required JSON format.\n\nThus, the solution will be:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '50283.07'} }\n```",
