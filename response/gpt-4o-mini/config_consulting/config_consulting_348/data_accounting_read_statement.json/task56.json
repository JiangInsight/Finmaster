The same figure appears in both statements, confirming consistency in reporting.\n\n2. **Confirm the Account Category:**\n   - The entry under **Accumulated Depreciation** in the balance sheet shows the accumulated total, which doesn't directly relate to the systematic allocation but indicates the total depreciation accounted for up to the reporting date. \n\n3. **Final Extraction:**\n   - Thus, the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount, which is frequently referred to as depreciation expense in financial statements, is captured by the value **91509.25**.\n\nNow, I will present this value in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91509.25'} }\n```",
