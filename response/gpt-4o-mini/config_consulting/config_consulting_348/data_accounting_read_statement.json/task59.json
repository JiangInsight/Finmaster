We'll classify these items according to the specified financial statement types.\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - We will check for the line item \"Interest Receivable\" and its end amount.\n   - The entry is found in the Balance Sheet:\n\n     | Account | End_amount |\n     | --- | --- |\n     | Interest Receivable | 14575.80 |\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - We look for the line item \"Interest Income\", even though it's technically not the accrued interest itself, it reflects the amount of interest that has been recognized as income during the period. However, itâ€™s the same value previously noted to recognize that it's accrued.\n   - The entry is found in the Income Statement:\n\n     | Account | Amount |\n     | --- | --- |\n     | Interest Income | 14575.80 |\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - We will search for the line item \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n   - The entry is present in the Cash Flow Statement:\n\n     | Account | Amount |\n     | --- | --- |\n     | Net Increase | -650630.22 |\n\nNow putting it all together:\n\n- `value1`: We're interested primarily in the \"Interest Receivable\" end amount which is **14575.80**.\n- `value2`: The \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents during the period which is **-650630.22**.\n\nThus, the final structured output will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14575.80', 'value2': '-650630.22'} }\n```",
