The relevant line item we are looking for is \"Interest Receivable,\" which indicates the amount of interest accrued but not yet received.\n\n### Step 1: Review the Balance Sheet\nThe \"Interest Receivable\" line item is presented in the balance sheet:\n\n- **Initial Amount (as of 2023-12-31)**: 0.00\n- **End Amount (as of 2024-02-05)**: 14575.80\n\nThis indicates that there was no interest receivable as of the end of 2023, but by the beginning of February 2024, there is an amount accrued.\n\n### Step 2: Confirm with the Cash Flow Statement\nThe cash flow statement also shows an \"Increase\" in Interest Receivable:\n\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**: -14575.80\n\nThis aligns with the increase in the Interest Receivable amount shown in the balance sheet, confirming the amount accrued during the reporting period.\n\n### Step 3: Confirm with the Income Statement\nThe income statement records \"Interest Income\":\n\n- **Interest Income**: 14575.80\n\nThis confirms that the amount earned as interest during the period corresponds to the increase in Interest Receivable, further validating the values extracted.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, we summarize the values of interest accrued but not yet received as follows:\n- **Initial Value**: 0.00\n- **End Value**: 14575.80\n\n### Final Output\nNow, we'll format the solution in the required JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '14575.80'} }\n```",
