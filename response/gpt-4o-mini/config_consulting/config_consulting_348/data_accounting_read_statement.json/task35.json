However, we will focus on \"Selling Expenses\" since it explicitly relates to securing customer orders.\n\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise**: This is represented by \"Financial Expenses\".\n\n3. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset**: This is represented by \"Depreciation\".\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes expected to be paid or recovered**: This is represented by \"Tax Expense\".\n\nNow, we extract the values accordingly from the income statement:\n\n- **Selling Expenses** (Costs incurred to secure customer orders and provide services): **309942.03**\n- **Depreciation** (Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount): **91509.25**\n- **Financial Expenses** (Financing costs): **50283.07**\n- **Tax Expense** (Total amount of taxes expected): **143478.02**\n\nNext, we present this information in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '309942.03', 'value2': '91509.25', 'value3': '50283.07', 'value4': '143478.02'} }\n```",
