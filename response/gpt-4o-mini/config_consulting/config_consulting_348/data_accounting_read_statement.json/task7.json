However, from the data you provided, it appears to be primarily balance sheet items.\n\nCommon expense line items typically found in a statement of profit or loss include but are not limited to:\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n- Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)\n- Depreciation Expense\n- Interest Expense\n- Tax Expense\n\nIn the data provided, \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is the only relevant expense related to profit or loss that can be identified. Here are the steps to extract the necessary information:\n\n1. Identify relevant line item: Accumulated Depreciation.\n2. Extract the initial amount and end amount for the identified line item.\n3. Present the initial and end values in the specified JSON format.\n\nNow, let's extract the values for \"Accumulated Depreciation\":\n- Initial value = 0.00\n- End value = 91509.25\n\nFinally, I will format the answer as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91509.25'} }\n```",
