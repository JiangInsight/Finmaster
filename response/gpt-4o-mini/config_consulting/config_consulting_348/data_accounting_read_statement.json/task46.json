Let's analyze the provided cash flow statement step by step.\n\n1. **Identify Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - From the problem statement, we see:\n     ```\n     Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n     Purchase of Fixed Assets            | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n     Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n     ```\n\n2. **Determine Main Line Item**:\n   - The specific line item related to cash flow from acquiring or disposing of long-term assets is \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" which is reported as `-0.00`. This indicates that there is no net cash flow generated from such activities during this period.\n\n3. **Component Sub-Items**:\n   - The sub-item we see is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of `0.00`. This suggests that no long-term assets were either acquired or disposed of.\n\n4. **Final Values**:\n   - The cash flow from investing activities is `-0.00`.\n   - The sub-item of \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is `0.00`.\n\nNow we can assemble the results in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_purchase_of_fixed_assets_value': '0.00'} }\n``` \n\nThis JSON structure adheres to the specifications provided, indicating the total net cash flow from investing activities and breaking down the sub-item related to fixed asset purchases.",
