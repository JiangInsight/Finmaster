We specifically want to find the total revenue, its value, and its constituent line items.\n\n1. **Identifying Total Income**: \n   The line item indicating total income from the income statement is \"Total Revenue,\" which is given as 2869560.42.\n\n2. **Verifying Line Items**: \n   - Looking at the provided data, we see that the \"Total Revenue\" matches with \"Main Business Revenue\" as both are equal to 2869560.42.\n\n3. **Extracting the values**: \n   - Value of \"Total Revenue\": 2869560.42\n   - Constituents:\n     - **Sub-item**: \"Main Business Revenue\"\n     - **Sub-item Value**: 2869560.42\n\nNow, we will prepare the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2869560.42', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '2869560.42'}}\n```",
