These are primarily represented by line items such as \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Inventory\".\n\nLet's analyze the balance sheet provided:\n\n1. **Fixed Assets**: \n   - Initial Amount: 5,000,000.00 \n   - End Amount: 5,000,000.00 \n\nThis represents the value of fixed assets held which are likely to be used in the production of goods or services.\n\n2. **Inventory**: \n   - Initial Amount: 0.00 \n   - End Amount: 112,000.00 \n\nThough the initial amount was zero, the end amount indicates that there are inventories which are also tangible items for the purpose of producing goods.\n\nNow letâ€™s summarize their values:\n- Fixed Assets (tangible for production): \n  - Initial: 5,000,000.00 \n  - End: 5,000,000.00 \n\n- Inventory (tangible for production):\n  - Initial: 0.00 \n  - End: 112,000.00 \n\nWe want the total initial and end values for tangible assets. The only fixed tangible asset (Fixed Assets) has an initial value of 5,000,000.00 with no change till end value. The Inventory which is also tangible shows that it has increased to 112,000, contributing to the end value.\n\nConsidering these two assets together, we will take the fixed assets initial and the inventory's end values to calculate total tangible assets held for production.\n\n- **Total Initial Value of Tangible Assets**: \n  - 5,000,000.00 (Fixed Assets)\n\n- **Total End Value of Tangible Assets**: \n  - 5,000,000.00 (Fixed Assets) + 112,000.00 (Inventory) = 5,112,000.00 \n\nThus, we have:\n- Initial Total Tangible Assets Value: 5,000,000.00\n- Final Total Tangible Assets Value: 5,112,000.00\n\nNow we can present the answer in the required format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5112000.00'} }\n```",
