This category includes Cash on Hand, Bank Deposits, Accounts Receivable, Interest Receivable, and Inventory. \n\n2. **Non-current Assets**: These include Fixed Assets and potentially any long-term investments or intangible assets not listed. These assets are expected to provide benefits over a longer period (more than one year or operating cycle) and can also include fixed assets that are dedicated to use in operations rather than for sale.\n\nIn this case, the assets not intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating course cycle would primarily fall under Fixed Assets, representing items such as machinery, buildings, vehicles, etc.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided:\n\n- **Fixed Assets Initial Amount**: 5,000,000.00\n- **Total Non-current Assets (which includes Fixed Assets)**, this amount is also 5,000,000.00 (before depreciation).\n- **Final Value (End Amount) for Total Non-current Assets**: 4,908,490.75.\n\nThus, summary of values:\n\n- **Initial Value of Total Non-current Assets**: 5,000,000.00\n- **End Value of Total Non-current Assets**: 4,908,490.75\n\nThe answer will now be formatted in the required JSON structure. \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4908490.75'}}\n```",
