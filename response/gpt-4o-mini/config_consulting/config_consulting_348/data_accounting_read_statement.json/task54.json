                        "content": "To extract the value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers, we look for relevant line items in the financial statements provided.\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** is a crucial value that tends to represent the costs directly tied to the production of goods sold by a company. COGS includes costs related to materials and labor directly involved in the production of goods. Hence, this line item is likely to encompass costs incurred in fulfilling customer orders.\n\n2. **Income Statement Review**: We see that under the income statement, the following line items are present:\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: **1249000.00**\n   - Total Cost: **1249000.00**\n\n3. **Selling Expenses** are another relevant line in the context of costs incurred for securing customer orders, as this relates to costs associated with selling the product or service, such as commissions, advertising, and marketing costs. From the income statement:\n   - Selling Expenses: **309942.03**\n\n4. To get the total relevant cost incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services, we combine both line items:\n   - COGS: **1249000.00**\n   - Selling Expenses: **309942.03**\n\n5. Thus, total relevant costs incurred are calculated as:\n   - Total Relevant Costs = COGS + Selling Expenses = **1249000.00 + 309942.03 = 1558942.03**\n\n6. The final value representing the costs that were incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers is **1249000.00** (from COGS), as that's the most direct representation of costs related to goods sold to customers. Selling expenses, while relevant, are tangential since the primary focus is on the cost of goods sold.\n\nThe result should reflect just the COGS:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1249000.00'} }\n```",
