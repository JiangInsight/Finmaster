We are specifically looking for entries that indicate changes in assets related to sales activities (such as inventory, accounts receivable, and related items). \n\n1. **Examine the Cash Flow From Operating Activities:**\n   - We have the following relevant items in the cash flow statement:\n     - **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**: -2149792.45\n     - **(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**: -14575.80\n     - **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: -112000.00\n\n2. **Assess Relevant Line Items:**\n   - The **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable** line indicates a reduction in money owed to the business for goods or services sold, which can indicate the conversion of inventory into sales.\n   - The **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory** shows a reduction in the amount of inventory, which is typically closely related to asset held for sale in the ordinary course of business. Since inventory is directly related to the goods available for sale, a reduction here indicates that assets held for sale have decreased.\n   - The **(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable** does not pertain to assets held for sale, as it refers to amounts due for interest payments.\n\n3. **Calculation of Total Reduction in Assets Held for Sale:**\n   - The most relevant line items in this context are:\n     - Accounts Receivable: -2149792.45\n     - Inventory: -112000.00\n   - However, since \"assets held for sale\" typically refers directly to inventory in manufacturing or selling contexts, we'll focus primarily on the inventory line for this specific measure.\n\n4. **Select the Relevant Value:**\n   - The inventory reduction (-112000.00) is the most pertinent line item that fits the description of reduction in assets held for sale during this period.\n\n5. **Prepare the Solution:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the value of reduction in the amount of assets held for sale during the period is -112000.00.\n\nThe final solution is presented in the required JSON format: \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-112000.00'} }\n```",
