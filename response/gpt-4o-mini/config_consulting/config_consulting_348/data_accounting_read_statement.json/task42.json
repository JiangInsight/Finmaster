It primarily includes revenues, expenses, and working capital adjustments, but it does not detail long-term asset purchases.\n\n2. **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This section is critical for our task. The line item here is:\n   - **Purchase of Fixed Assets** which is relevant for cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement details:\n\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The recorded amount is **0.00**.\n  \nSince this is the only line item that pertains to the acquisition of long-term assets, our search concludes here.\n\nThe value we found for cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment is 0.00.\n\nThus, the formatted answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
