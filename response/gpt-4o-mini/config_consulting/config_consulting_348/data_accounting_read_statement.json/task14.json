The main components of current liabilities typically include:\n\n1. Accounts Payable\n2. Taxes Payable\n3. Any other short-term obligations that may be categorized as current liabilities.\n\nFrom the balance sheet data provided, we can identify the relevant line items for current liabilities:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable:**  \n   - Initial Amount: 0.00  \n   - End Amount: 485000.00\n\n2. **Taxes Payable:**  \n   - Initial Amount: 0.00  \n   - End Amount: 143478.02\n\n3. **Total Current Liabilities:**  \n   - Initial Amount: 0.00  \n   - End Amount: 628478.02\n\nNow, to find the total current liabilities at the end date, we can summarize the end amounts of the individual components:\n\n- Total Current Liabilities at the end date is already provided as 628478.02.\n\nThus, for the initial value of total current liabilities, which is represented as 0.00, and the end value as 628478.02, we will construct the final answer.\n\nHere's how the solution will look in the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '628478.02'} }\n```",
