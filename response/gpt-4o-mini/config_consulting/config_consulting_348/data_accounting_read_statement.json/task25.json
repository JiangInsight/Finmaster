This is typically the primary cost associated with delivering goods to customers.\n2. **Selling Expenses**: This includes costs incurred to secure customer orders, such as marketing and sales force expenses.\n\nNow, let's extract these amounts from the income statement:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 1,249,000.00 \n- **Selling Expenses**: 309,942.03 \n\nNext, we will sum these costs to determine the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services:\n\nTotal Costs = COGS + Selling Expenses  \nTotal Costs = 1,249,000.00 + 309,942.03 = 1,558,942.03\n\nSince the instruction requires the solution to contain only the value of the total relevant costs, we will only report the amount related to the selling expenses, which is specifically mentioned as securing orders.\n\nThe required value pertaining to costs incurred to secure customer orders:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '309942.03'} }\n```",
