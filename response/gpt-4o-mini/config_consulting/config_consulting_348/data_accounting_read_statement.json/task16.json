Identify the total amount of liabilities and equity recognized in the statement of financial position, which is given under \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity.\"\n\n2. Extract relevant data: \n   - Initial value of \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity.\"\n   - End value of \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity.\"\n   \n3. Decompose \"Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\" into its two component sub-items:\n   - \"Total Current Liabilities\"\n   - \"Total Owner's Equity\"\n\n4. For each of the sub-items, extract their initial and end values.\n\nHere is the detailed breakdown based on the provided data:\n\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity:**\n    - Initial Value: 13000000.00\n    - End Value: 14534228.78\n  - Component Sub-item 1: **Total Current Liabilities**\n    - Initial Value: 0.00\n    - End Value: 628478.02\n  - Component Sub-item 2: **Total Owner's Equity**\n    - Initial Value: 13000000.00\n    - End Value: 13905750.76\n\nNow, we can compile this information into the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '14534228.78', 'sub_items_initial sub_item value1': '0.00', 'sub_items_end sub_item value1': '628478.02', 'sub_items_initial sub_item value2': '13000000.00', 'sub_items_end sub_item value2': '13905750.76'}}\n```",
