We will do this by reviewing the accounts on the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Balance Sheet:\nThe balance sheet provides information about the liability amounts owed by the entity.\n\n- **Accounts Payable:** This entry signifies the amounts owed for goods or services received on credit. The balance at the end date (2024-02-05) is **485,000.00**.\n- **Taxes Payable:** This entry is also a liability but typically is not directly related to goods or services received on credit, so we don't account for it in our specific task.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Cash Flow Statement:\nThe cash flow statement indicates how cash has changed during the period.\n\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable:** The amount is **485,000.00**. This reflects an increase (i.e., since the previous amount was 0.00) and confirms the amount due for goods or services credited.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Income Statement:\nThe income statement primarily reflects the revenues and expenses for the period.\n\n- There are no direct references to accounts payable or amounts owed for goods and services in this statement, so it serves more as context rather than directly aiding our extraction of the \"addition in the amount owed.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the above analysis, the key line item relevant to the task of identifying the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods and services received on credit is the **Accounts Payable** of **485,000.00**.\n\nThus, the answer to the problem is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '485000.00'}}\n```",
