                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio, we need to derive two key components from the balance sheet: Total Liabilities and Total Assets.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Total Assets**\nFrom the problem, the total assets as of the end of the reporting period (2024-02-05) is provided:\n- Total Assets = 15,528,390.30\n\n**Step 2: Identify Total Liabilities**\nWe will identify the total liabilities by adding the accounts payable, taxes payable, and any other liabilities if provided. In this case, we are given:\n- Accounts Payable = 381,000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 243,988.48\n- Total Current Liabilities = 624,988.48\n\nThus, Total Liabilities (only current liabilities are present here as no long-term liabilities are mentioned):\n- Total Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable + Total Current Liabilities\n- Total Liabilities = 381,000.00 + 243,988.48 + 624,988.48\n\nCalculating:\n- Total Liabilities = 381,000.00 + 243,988.48 = 624,988.48 (Confirmed that current liabilities already provide this total.)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Debt to Asset Ratio**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{624,988.48}{15,528,390.30}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} \\approx 0.0402\n\\]\nTo express this in a percentage form for better understanding, we can multiply by 100:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} \\approx 4.02\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, in the final required format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04'}}\n```",
