Here's the breakdown:\n\n- There is a line item labeled \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" listed in the Cash Flow from Operating Activities section.\n- The amount for this line item is noted as -485000.00.\n\nThis amount indicates a decrease in inventory, which is relevant as it relates to assets that are in production for sale or potentially being held for sale.\n\nThus, we will extract this value for our solution. \n\nThe final format for the solution, based on the preceding analysis, will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-485000.00'} }\n```",
