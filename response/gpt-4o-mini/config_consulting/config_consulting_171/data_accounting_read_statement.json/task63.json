End value of cash and cash equivalents generated from principal revenue-producing activities (which comes from the cash flow statement).\n2. Amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid (found on the balance sheet).\n3. Total income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities (from the income statement).\n\nLet's analyze each financial statement accordingly step by step, maintaining the given structure:\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\nFrom the balance sheet, we need to extract the amount for \"Taxes Payable\":\n- **Taxes Payable**: 243988.48\n\n### 2. Income Statement\nFrom the income statement, we need to extract the total income, which is represented by \"Net Profit\":\n- **Net Profit**: 1903401.82\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nFrom the cash flow statement, we need to look at the line item for \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\":\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -862455.97 (This represents the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated or used in operating activities.)\n\nWe will now consolidate the extracted values into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '243988.48', 'value2': '1903401.82', 'value3': '-862455.97'}}\n```",
