The income statement includes several accounts, and we look particularly for items that refer to financial expenses or costs associated with borrowing.\n\nUpon review of the accounts listed:\n\n- **Financial Expenses** is mentioned with an amount of **67135.35**.\n\nThis line item typically reflects the costs incurred to raise funds, which can include interest on loans, bank fees, and similar costs.\n\nTherefore, the value corresponding to the financing costs incurred by the enterprise is **67135.35**.\n\nNow, we can format this into the required JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '67135.35'} }\n```",
