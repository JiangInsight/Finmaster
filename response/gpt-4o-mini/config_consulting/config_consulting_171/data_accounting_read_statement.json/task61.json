The costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets.\n\nLet's analyze each financial statement step by step.\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\nIn the balance sheet, we are looking for line items relating to:\n- Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services (which typically will not be present here as it is primarily an asset and liability statement).\n- Cash payments for property, plant, and equipment can potentially be reflected under \"Fixed Assets,\" but no actual transaction is shown as a cash outflow here.\n\nFrom the given balance sheet:\n- No relevant data can be extracted regarding costs incurred for customer orders. \n- The line item \"Fixed Assets\" shows the value of fixed assets but does not specify cash payments.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow Statement\nIn the cash flow statement, we can identify:\n- Costs incurred to deliver goods/services usually reflected in operating activities, particularly under the \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n- Cash payments for property, plant, and equipment often appear under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n\nFrom the provided cash flow statement:\n- The relevant cost incurred related to customer orders is indicated within the context of the \"Cost of Goods Sold\":\n  - **Cost of Goods Sold** related to securing customer orders: **2018000.00**\n  \n- For cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, we need to look for purchases in the investing activities section:\n  - **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: **0.00** (no acquisitions in this period)\n\n### 3. Income Statement\nFrom the income statement, we specifically look for:\n- Costs incurred in delivering goods and services.\n- However, we already have the **Cost of Goods Sold** from the previous analysis, reflecting the cost associated with this.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- We have the **Cost of Goods Sold** which is **2018000.00**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the assessment, we will now present the values for both types of costs:\n\n- The cost incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services, representing the **Cost of Goods Sold**, is **2018000.00**.\n- There have been no cash payments for property, plant, and equipment specified, indicating **0.00** investment.\n\nPutting this information together, the solution can be defined as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2018000.00', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```",
