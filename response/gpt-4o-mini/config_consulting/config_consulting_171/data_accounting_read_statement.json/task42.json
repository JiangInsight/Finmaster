The relevant line item that indicates cash payments for acquiring fixed assets is: \n   - **Purchase of Fixed Assets** \n\n2. In the given problem, the line item **\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"** has an amount of **0.00**.\n\n3. Since we are only interested in the cash payments for acquisition of property, plant, and equipment:\n   - The value we need to extract is **0.00**.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can formulate the solution in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
