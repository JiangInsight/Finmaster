This indicates a decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n### Step 3: Compile Results\nNow, we compile the results into the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13279.60', 'value2': '-862455.97'}}\n```\n\nThis JSON correctly reflects the values we have extracted from the financial statements.",
