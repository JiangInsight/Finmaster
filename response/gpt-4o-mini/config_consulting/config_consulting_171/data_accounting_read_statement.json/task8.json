In the provided balance sheet data, the relevant line items under liabilities that typically refer to \"amounts owed\" include:\n\n- Accounts Payable\n- Taxes Payable\n- Total Current Liabilities\n\nLet's analyze these line items in detail:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**:\n   - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n   - End Amount: `381000.00`\n\n2. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n   - End Amount: `243988.48`\n\n3. **Total Current Liabilities**:\n   - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n   - End Amount: `624988.48`\n\nFrom the above, we can conclude:\n\n- For **Accounts Payable**:\n  - Initial Value: `0.00`\n  - End Value: `381000.00`\n\n- For **Taxes Payable**:\n  - Initial Value: `0.00`\n  - End Value: `243988.48`\n\nBased on the problem statement, the initial value for these liabilities started at `0.00`. However, the total amount owed at the end of the period, for the purposes of this summary, can be determined by each individual line item.\n\nSince the task specifically asks for \"amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit,\" typically, Accounts Payable is the primary focus here. \n\nThus, presenting the solution for Accounts Payable specifically:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '381000.00'}}\n```",
