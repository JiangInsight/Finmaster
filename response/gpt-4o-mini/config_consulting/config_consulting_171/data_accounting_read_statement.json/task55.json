The value is **243988.48**.\n   - In the **income statement**, we find:\n     - **Tax Expense**: This is typically considered the total tax expense for the reporting period. The value is also **243988.48**.\n\n3. **Determine Relevance:**\n   - Since both \"Taxes Payable\" and \"Tax Expense\" point to the same figure of **243988.48**, we can confidently extract this as the entity's expected tax payment.\n\n4. **Formulate the JSON Output:**\n   - Now that we have determined the value, we will create a JSON formatted response encapsulating this value in the prescribed structure.\n\nSo, the final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '243988.48'} }\n```",
