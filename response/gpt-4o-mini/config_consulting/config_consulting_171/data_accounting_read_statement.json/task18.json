Cash held by an entity that is available for use in its day-to-day operations.\n2. Tangible items that are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, or for administrative purposes (this corresponds to 'Fixed Assets').\n3. Amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid (this corresponds to 'Taxes Payable').\n\nNow, let's identify and extract these items along with their initial and end amounts:\n\n1. **Cash**:\n   - **Cash on Hand**:\n     - Initial Amount: 3000000.00\n     - End Amount: 4058544.03\n   - **Bank Deposits**:\n     - Initial Amount: 5000000.00\n     - End Amount: 3079000.00\n   - The Cash amount can be considered as a combination of both Cash on Hand and Bank Deposits, however, for the sake of the solution, we'll treat Cash on Hand as a primary cash item.\n\n2. **Tangible Items (Fixed Assets)**:\n   - **Fixed Assets**:\n     - Initial Amount: 5000000.00\n     - End Amount: 5000000.00\n\n3. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - **Taxes Payable**:\n     - Initial Amount: 0.00\n     - End Amount: 243988.48\n\nNow, we'll compile these values in the required JSON format while maintaining the original order of line items as indicated:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '3000000.00', 'end valu1': '4058544.03', 'initial value2': '5000000.00', 'end valu2': '5000000.00', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '243988.48'}}\n```",
