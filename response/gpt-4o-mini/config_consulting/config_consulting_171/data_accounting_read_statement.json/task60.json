This typically reflects income earned from financial assets.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - I will search for the \"Interest Income\" line item, which represents the income earned by the entity from financial assets.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - This statement generally does not contain line items for bank deposits or interest income in the same manner as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement. Thus, I will not extract any further values from this statement.\n\nNow, let's extract the relevant values step-by-step:\n\n### From the Balance Sheet:\n- **Bank Deposits**:\n  - End Amount: **3079000.00**\n  \n- **Interest Receivable**:\n  - End Amount: **13279.60**\n\n### From the Income Statement:\n- **Interest Income**:\n  - Amount: **13279.60**\n\n### Summary of Relevant Values:\n- For bank deposits (End Amount): **3079000.00**\n- For income earned from financial assets (Interest Income): **13279.60**\n\nNow I will format the solution according to the specified JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3079000.00', 'value2': '13279.60'} }\n```",
