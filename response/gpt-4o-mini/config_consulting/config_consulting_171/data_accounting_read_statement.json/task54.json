In financial statements, these costs generally fall under the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) and potentially include selling expenses.\n\n1. **Identifying Relevant Section**: \n   We need to look at the income statement, as it's where the costs related to revenue generation and operational expenses are presented.\n\n2. **Locate the Costs in the Income Statement**:\n   - The relevant line items in the income statement include:\n     - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This directly represents the costs incurred in the production of goods sold by the company.\n     - **Selling Expenses**: These are the expenses incurred to deliver those goods/services to customers.\n\n3. **Extracting Values**:\n   The extracted values in the provided income statement are:\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold**: 2018000.00\n   - **Selling Expenses**: 274260.07\n\n4. **Total Costs**:\n   To find the total costs incurred to secure orders and deliver goods:\n   - Total = COGS + Selling Expenses\n   - Calculation: \n     - 2018000.00 (COGS) + 274260.07 (Selling Expenses) = 2292260.07\n\n5. **Final Value**: \n   Though we could present both COGS and Selling Expenses separately, the problem seems to require a single value reflecting these costs, which in this instance is COGS, as it is the primary cost associated with goods sold.\n\nThus, the main focus is on the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" for this task. \n\n**Final Answer**:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2018000.00'} }\n```",
