This typically corresponds to accounts receivable, which reflects amounts owed by customers for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n2. **Locate Accounts Receivable Item**: In the provided cash flow statement, the line item \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is present. It specifically indicates a decrease (in this context, it is negative) in accounts receivable during the period.\n\n3. **Extract Value**: The value corresponding to \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" is -2984071.72. This negative value signifies a decrease in accounts receivable, meaning that the entity has collected payments from its customers, reducing what is owed.\n\n4. **Format the Solution**: Following the required JSON format, we present the extracted value in the specified structure.\n\nPutting this information together, the final output in JSON format will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2984071.72'} }\n```",
