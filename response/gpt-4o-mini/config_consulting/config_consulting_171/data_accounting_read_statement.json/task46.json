This indicates that there were no expenditures for the purchase of long-term assets during the reporting period. \n\n2. **Calculation of Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - The Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities line indicates that it sums the investments made: \n     - Since the only line item under Investing Activities is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" given as `0.00`, the Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities is also `-0.00`.\n\n3. **Net Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - The value representing net cash and cash equivalents generated from investing activities is `-0.00`.\n\n4. **Decomposing into Sub-Items**:\n   - There is only one sub-item which is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" valued at `0.00`.\n\nBased on this breakdown, we can summarize our findings in the desired JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_item value': '0.00'}}\n```",
