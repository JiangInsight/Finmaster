The three required line items are:\n\n1. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: This represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This corresponds to the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.\n\n3. **Beginning Balance**: This indicates the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\nNow, letâ€™s identify these values in the provided cash flow statement:\n\n- The **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** value is located under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\":\n  - **Value**: `381000.00`\n\n- The **Purchase of Fixed Assets** value is located under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\":\n  - **Value**: `0.00` (it indicates that there were no acquisitions in this period)\n\n- The **Beginning Balance** for cash and cash equivalents is located under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\":\n  - **Value**: `8000000.00`\n\nNow we can present these values in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '381000.00', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
