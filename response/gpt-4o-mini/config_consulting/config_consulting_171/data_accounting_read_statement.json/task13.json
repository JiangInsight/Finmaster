This typically refers to the non-current assets, such as fixed assets less accumulated depreciation.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant line items**:\n   - Total Non-current Assets: This is the primary line item that captures fixed assets less accumulated depreciation.\n   - The specific components include:\n     - Fixed Assets\n     - Accumulated Depreciation (which reduces the value of fixed assets)\n\n2. **Extract the initial and end values**:\n   - From the given balance sheet, we have:\n     - Fixed Assets: \n       - Initial Amount: 5000000.00 \n       - End Amount: 5000000.00\n     - Accumulated Depreciation: \n       - Initial Amount: 0.00 \n       - End Amount: 91505.05\n   - Therefore, the Total Non-current Assets line is calculated as:\n     - Total Non-current Assets = Fixed Assets - Accumulated Depreciation\n     - Initial Total Non-current Assets = 5000000.00 - 0.00 = 5000000.00\n     - End Total Non-current Assets = 5000000.00 - 91505.05 = 4908494.95\n\n3. **Collate the total values**:\n   - The initial value of non-current assets is 5000000.00.\n   - The end value of non-current assets is 4908494.95.\n\nThus, we will document the initial and end values of the non-current assets in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4908494.95'} }\n```",
