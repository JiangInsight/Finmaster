Both of these together reflect the total cash available for daily operations at the beginning and the end.\n\n4. **Creating the Final Output**:\n   - The task requires us to provide a JSON structure with the initial and final values of cash held by the entity.\n   - For our response, we are interested in the values as they are without summing them, so we will report the two accounts distinctly if needed or just report the one that reflects cash on hand, depending on clarity needed.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, let's present the solution with relevant data extracted from the balance sheet.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '3000000.00', 'end value': '4058544.03'}}\n```",
