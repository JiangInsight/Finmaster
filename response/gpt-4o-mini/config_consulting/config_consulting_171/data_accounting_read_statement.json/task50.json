In the provided statement, the value for depreciation is:  \n   **Value1**: `91505.05`\n\n2. **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: This indicates the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period. From the statement, the corresponding amount is:  \n   **Value2**: `-485000.00`\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: This reflects the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that involve the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents. In this cash flow statement, it is:  \n   **Value3**: `-0.00`\n\n4. **Net Increase**: This represents the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period. From the statement, this value is:  \n   **Value4**: `-862455.97`\n\nNow we can present these values in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91505.05', 'value2': '-485000.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-862455.97'} }\n```",
