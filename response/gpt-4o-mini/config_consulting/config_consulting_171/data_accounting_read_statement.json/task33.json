The income arising from the core operating activities, which is typically represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\".\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nNow, let's look at the problem's data:\n\n```\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 4879769.51 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 4879769.51 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 2018000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost | 2018000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit | 2861769.51 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 294758.34 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Selling Expenses | 274260.07 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation | 91505.05 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses | 67135.35 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses | 727658.81 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income | 13279.60 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 2147390.30 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense | 243988.48 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit | 1903401.82 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nFrom this information:\n\n1. **Main Business Revenue (Income)**: The amount for this line item is **4879769.51**, which indicates the core operating income.\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold (Inventories Sold)**: The amount for this line item is **2018000.00**, which represents the cost of the inventories sold during the period.\n\nNow, let's present the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '4879769.51', 'value2': '2018000.00'}}\n```",
