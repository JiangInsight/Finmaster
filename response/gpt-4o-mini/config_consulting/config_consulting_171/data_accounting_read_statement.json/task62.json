                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to extract specific financial data from three financial statements: the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement. The specific line items we are interested in are:\n\n1. Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit (which relates to **Accounts Receivable**).\n2. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation (which relates to **Financial Expenses**).\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets (found under **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**, specifically looking for purchases of Fixed Assets).\n\nWe will locate these items in the provided financial statements, starting with the Balance Sheet, followed by the Income Statement, and finally the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Step 1: Balance Sheet\n- **Accounts Receivable**: This line item is found in the Balance Sheet, and its end amount is **2984071.72**. This represents the amounts owed to the entity.\n  \n### Step 2: Income Statement\n- **Financial Expenses**: This line item shows the costs incurred for financing and is found here with an amount of **67135.35**.\n\n### Step 3: Cash Flow Statement\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: Under the Cash Flow from Investing Activities, we see that the line for **Purchase of Fixed Assets** shows an amount of **0.00**.\n\nNow we can summarize our findings:\n\n- **Accounts Receivable** (Amount owed to the entity): **2984071.72**\n- **Financial Expenses** (Financing costs incurred): **67135.35**\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets** (Cash payments for assets): **0.00**\n\nThus, we can format the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2984071.72', 'value2': '67135.35', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```",
