It includes any costs directly associated with the production of goods and services that are sold.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses**: This includes costs that are related to the selling of the product. These could include costs such as sales commission, advertising, and other costs directly tied to the sale of goods.\n\nFrom the provided income statement, we can observe the following relevant values:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: **2018000.00**\n- Selling Expenses: **274260.07**\n\nNext, we need to sum these two amounts to get the total costs incurred to secure orders and deliver goods and services.\n\nCalculating the total:\n- Total Costs = COGS + Selling Expenses\n- Total Costs = 2018000.00 + 274260.07 = 2292260.07\n\nNow that we have identified the total costs incurred for these purposes, we can present our answer in the required JSON format.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2292260.07'} }\n```",
