The specific accounts we need to look for are typically \"Inventory\" as it often includes items available for sale, as well as any accounts that may refer to assets being manufactured for sale.\n\n1. **Identifying relevant accounts from the given table:**\n   - **Cash on Hand**: Not relevant\n   - **Bank Deposits**: Not relevant\n   - **Interest Receivable**: Not relevant\n   - **Accounts Receivable**: Not relevant\n   - **Inventory**: Relevant because it represents goods available for sale. \n   - **Total Current Assets**: Not relevant\n   - **Fixed Assets**: Not relevant\n   - **Accumulated Depreciation**: Not relevant\n   - **Total Non-current Assets**: Not relevant\n   - **Total Assets**: Not relevant\n   - **Accounts Payable**: Not relevant\n   - **Taxes Payable**: Not relevant\n   - **Total Current Liabilities**: Not relevant\n   - **Paid-in Capital**: Not relevant\n   - **Retained Earnings**: Not relevant\n   - **Total Owner's Equity**: Not relevant\n   - **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity**: Not relevant\n\n2. **Extracting details for Inventory:**\n   - **Initial Amount** for Inventory: 0.00\n   - **End Amount** for Inventory: 485000.00\n\n3. **Formulating the solution:**\n   Given that the only relevant line item is \"Inventory,\" we will extract the initial and end values from it. The initial value is 0.00 and the end value is 485000.00.\n\n4. **Presenting the solution in the required JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '485000.00'} }\n```",
