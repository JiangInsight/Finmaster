                        "content": "To calculate the Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity, we consider the following components based on the given transactions:\n\n### Initial Situation Calculation:\n1. **Cash Deposits** \n   - Cash Deposit: 3,000,000.00 \n   - Bank Deposit: 5,000,000.00 \n   - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00 \n\n   The initial total is calculated by summing up these amounts:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Initial Value} = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000\n   \\]\n   - Total Initial Value = **13,000,000.00** \n\n### Transactions Affecting Liabilities and Equity:\n1. **Purchases (which increase liabilities)**\n   - Purchase 1: 20,000.00 (Unpaid)\n   - Purchase 2: 40,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase 3: 20,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase 4: 60,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase 5: 200,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase 6: 300,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase 7: 100,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase 8: 10,000.00 (Paid)\n\n2. **Expenses (which decrease equity)**\n   - Administrative Expenses 1: 14,726.63 \n   - Administrative Expenses 2: 14,629.67 \n   - Financial Expenses: 4,678.66 \n   - Sale Expenses 1: 12,921.28 \n   - Sale Expenses 2: 18,876.84 \n   - Sale Expenses 3: 11,420.55 \n\n3. **Sales (which increase equity)**\n   - Sale 1: 53,170.71 (Unpaid)\n   - Sale 2: 47,593.55 (Paid)\n   - Sale 3: 29,443.71 (Unpaid)\n   - Sale 4: 292,945.94 (Paid)\n   - Sale 5: 115,000.00 (Unpaid)\n\n### Calculating End Values:\n- **Add Sales Revenue to Owner's Equity:**\n   Add up unpaid and paid sales amounts. As this specifically involves sales revenues that impact owner's equity directly:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Sales} = 53,170.71 + 47,593.55 + 29,443.71 + 292,945.94 + 115,000.00 = 537,153.91\n   \\]\n\n- **Expense Amounts that decrease Owner's Equity:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Expenses} = 14,726.63 + 14,629.67 + 4,678.66 + 12,921.28 + 18,876.84 + 11,420.55 = 76,834.63\n   \\]\n\n- **Calculating Final Owner's Equity:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Owner's Equity} = \\text{Total Initial Value} + \\text{Total Sales} - \\text{Total Expenses}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 13,000,000 + 537,153.91 - 76,834.63 = 13,460,319.28\n   \\]\n\n### Summary of Liabilities:\n- Calculate the sum of unpaid liabilities (the total from purchases), which sum up as well:\n  - Total purchases unpaid = 20,000 + 40000 + 20000 + 300000 + 100000 + 5000 = 413,000.00\n\n### Final Calculation:\nCombine the total assets and liabilities together for the final values:\n1. Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity Initial Value: **13,000,000.00**\n2. Total Liabilities and Owner’s Equity Final Value: **13,460,319.28**\n\n### Result in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value': '13460319.28'} }\n```",
