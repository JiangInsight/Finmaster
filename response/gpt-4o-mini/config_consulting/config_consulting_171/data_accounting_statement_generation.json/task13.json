From the transactions given, the starting amount for taxes payable (`tax_amount`) is **0.00** (no transactions logged).\n\n3. **Calculate Taxes Payable from Transactions:**\n   - We scan the list for transactions with a non-zero `tax_amount` starting from January 1, 2024, through January 31, 2024.\n   - Here are the relevant transactions that appear with a `tax_amount`:\n     - Sale20240102001: Sale, Tax Amount: 2658.54\n     - Sale20240104004: Sale, Tax Amount: 2379.68\n     - Sale20240105006: Sale, Tax Amount: 2377.76\n     - Sale20240107010: Sale, Tax Amount: 2179.85\n     - Sale20240108041: Sale, Tax Amount: 12504.53\n     - Sale20240109019: Sale, Tax Amount: 14688.62\n     - Sale20240120043: Sale, Tax Amount: 476.14\n     - Sale20240112024: Sale, Tax Amount: 12129.98\n     - Sale20240113013: Sale, Tax Amount: 2417.10\n     - Sale20240114030: Sale, Tax Amount: 9523.91\n\n4. **Adding the Tax Amounts:**\n   - Now we will add these values to get the total taxes payable at the end date:\n     - \\( 2658.54 + 2379.68 + 2377.76 + 2179.85 + 12504.53 + 14688.62 + 476.14 + 12129.98 + 2417.10 + 9523.91 = 271550.92 \\)\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The taxes payable at the initial point remains **0.00**.\n   - The ending total calculated is **271550.92**.\n\n6. **Final Output:**\nWe will format this solution into the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Taxes Payable End Value': '271550.92'}}\n```",
