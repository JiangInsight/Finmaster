Any transactions involving payments that would reduce accounts payable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify Purchases (Unpaid):**\n   - Sum the amounts for purchases with a status of \"Unpaid.\"\n   \n   **Relevant Transactions**:\n   - Purchase20231231011: 300,000.0 (Unpaid)\n   - Purchase20231231024: 40,000.0 (Unpaid)\n   - Purchase20231231031: 40,000.0 (Unpaid)\n\n   Total Unpaid Purchases:\n   \\[\n   300,000.0 + 40,000.0 + 40,000.0 = 380,000.0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify Other Transactions:**\n   - Review the other transactions to see if any payments were made against accounts payable:\n     - None of the provided transactions decrease accounts payable, as all relevant payments would typically reduce the accounts payable numerically, and those transactions do not reference any accounts receivable payments related to unpaid purchases.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Change in Accounts Payable:**\n   - Since there were no decreases identified, the **increase in accounts payable** is solely from the unpaid purchases calculated above.\n\nThus, the final answer for the change in accounts payable is a total increase of **380,000.00** derived from the unpaid purchases.\n\n### Solution Presentation:\nNow we present the result as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '380000.00'}}\n```",
