All transactions up to 2023-12-31 before any purchases are generally expected to have zero accounts payable unless specifically noted for unpaid purchases.\n\n2. **Track Purchases with Payment Status**:\n   Any \"Purchase\" transaction that is marked as \"Unpaid\" should contribute to the Accounts Payable. We can summarize these transactions to compute the total amount that contributes to Accounts Payable.\n\n3. **Sum Unpaid Purchases**:\n   For this specific dataset, we will iterate through each \"Purchase\" record and sum up the amounts where the `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\".\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   As the problem shows purchases dated on 2023-12-31, we will consider those, and we will also see future purchases that might have a balance into accounts payable.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculations:\n\n**Initial Accounts Payable Calculation** (before any additional purchases):\n- Initial Accounts Payable: **0.00** (Assumed since no unpaid purchases exist before 2023-12-31).\n\n**Calculating End Value of Accounts Payable**:\n- Examining the records for unpaid purchases:\n   - For Purchase20231231011 (amount: 300000.0, status: Unpaid)\n   - For Purchase20231231024 (amount: 40000.0, status: Unpaid)\n   - For Purchase20231231031 (amount: 40000.0, status: Unpaid)\n\n**Total Unpaid Accounts Payable**:\n- End Value Calculation:\n  ```\n  300000.0 + 40000.0 + 40000.0 = 380000.0\n  ```\n\n### Final Values:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '380000.00'}}\n```",
