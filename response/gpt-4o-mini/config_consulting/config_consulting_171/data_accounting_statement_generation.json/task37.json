There are two depreciation entries that we need to look at:\n   - The first is `\"Depreciation20240101001\"` which has an amount of `45754.63999999999`.\n   - The second is `\"Depreciation20240201002\"` which has an amount of `45750.41`.\n\nTo find the final depreciation to include in the cash flow statement:\n- We need to ensure that we correctly round or format the depreciation values as required. \n- It appears that both entries reflect depreciation taken within different accounting periods.\n\nHereâ€™s how we will approach the calculation:\n1. Review both depreciation entries.\n2. Since we're interested in the total depreciation amount for the final statement, we will likely sum these two values.\n3. However, based on the structure of the question and the provided final example from the task description, the expectation may be to report only the last period's depreciation entry.\n\n### Final Steps:\nSince we notice that the last recorded depreciation entry is `45750.41` for `\"Depreciation20240201002\"`, we will use this value.\n\n### Answer:\nThus, the final answer to the cash flow statement for depreciation will be reported as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45750.41'}}\n```",
