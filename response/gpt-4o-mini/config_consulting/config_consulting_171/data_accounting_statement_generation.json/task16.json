We need to sum up the amounts involved in sales, purchases, expenses, and profits to find the final paid-in capital.\n\n   - **Sales:**\n     Total amount from sales does not directly affect the capital unless it’s retained earnings; however, they do contribute to the overall available funds. The specifics of sales do not add to the paid-in capital directly.\n\n   - **Purchases and Expenses:**\n     These will represent costs against the income generated but again do not affect paid-in capital directly. Hence, we do not deduct or add these for determining paid-in capital.\n\n   - Since the data summarizes only through expenses and revenues without expressly defining further capital inputs or withdrawals through share issuance, we can assume the initial remains unchanged in the absence of transaction information indicating capital adjustments.\n\n   Final Paid-in Capital = Initial Paid-in Capital = `13000000.0`\n\nNow, we can summarize the findings:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
