It consists of a section for operating activities, investing activities, and the cash and cash equivalents section.\n\n2. **Identifying Net Profit**: From the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, we can see a line item labeled \"Net Profit.\" This line specifically shows the amount of profit after deducting expenses like operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization from total revenue.\n\n3. **Finding the Relevant Line Item and Value**: \n   - The relevant line item is \"Net Profit.\"\n   - The value associated with this line item is `963263.19`.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can structure our final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '963263.19'} }\n```",
