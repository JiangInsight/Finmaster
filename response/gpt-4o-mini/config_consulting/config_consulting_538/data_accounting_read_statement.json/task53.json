We particularly focus on the income statement and cash flow.\n\n1. **Identify from the Income Statement:**\n   - The item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) is crucial because it represents the cost of inventories that were sold during the reporting period. \n   - From the income statement, we see that:\n     - Cost of Goods Sold = 1,312,000.00\n\n2. **Check the Cash Flow Statement:**\n   - The cash flow statement does not directly provide the inventory sold, but it gives us insights into changes in inventory.\n   - However, its primary focus here is on the \"Decrease in Inventory\", which shows:\n     - Decrease in Inventory = -174,000.00\n   - This indicates that the inventory levels decreased by this amount, but it does not directly tell us the cost associated with the sales.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The relevant line item that represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" on the income statement.\n   - Thus, the carrying amount of inventory sold during the reporting period is:\n     - Value = 1,312,000.00\n\nNow, we can format the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1312000.00'} }\n```",
