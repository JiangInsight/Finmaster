These typically include Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Identify Relevant Accounts**:\n   - From the provided balance sheet, the accounts that relate to amounts owed for goods/services purchased on credit are:\n     - **Accounts Payable**: This account reflects amounts owed to suppliers for goods and services received but not yet paid for.\n     - **Taxes Payable**: This account reflects taxes owed to the government that have not yet been paid.\n\n2. **Analyze Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Accounts Payable**:\n     - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n     - End Amount: `816000.00`\n   - **Taxes Payable**:\n     - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n     - End Amount: `151271.87`\n\n3. **Extract Values**:\n   - For the purpose of this task, we only need the **end values** because these denote the amounts currently owed at the time of reporting in the balance sheet.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Amount Owed**:\n   - Total Owed = End Amount of Accounts Payable + End Amount of Taxes Payable\n   - Total Owed = `816000.00` + `151271.87` = `967271.87`\n\n5. **Prepare the JSON Response**:\n   - We specifically require the initial value and the end value of the Accounts Payable since it's the primary metric for goods/services received on credit (Taxes Payable, while still valid, is not typically categorized in this context). \n\n### Final Result:\nNow, we can construct the final JSON response keeping the required format in mind:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '816000.00'} }\n```",
