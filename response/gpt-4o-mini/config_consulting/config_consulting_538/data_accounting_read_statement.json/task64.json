Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (this corresponds to \"Paid-in Capital\").\n2. The ending amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period (this corresponds to \"Accounts Payable\").\n   \n**Balance Sheet Values**:\n- **Paid-in Capital**: 13000000.00 \n- **Accounts Payable**: 816000.00\n\n### Step 2: Income Statement\nNext, from the income statement, we need to find the profit or loss for the period before deducting tax expense (this corresponds to \"Profit Before Tax\").\n\n**Income Statement Value**:\n- **Profit Before Tax**: 1114535.06 \n\n### Step 3: Cash Flow Statement\nIn the cash flow statement, we need to identify the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit, which corresponds to the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\n**Cash Flow Statement Value**:\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: 816000.00 \n\nNow that we have identified all three required values, we can present them in the specified output format.\n\n### Final Output\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '1114535.06', 'value3': '816000.00'}}\n```",
