The specific line items we are looking for are:\n\n1. **Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit** - typically found in Accounts Receivable.\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise** – typically found under Financial Expenses.\n3. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets** – typically found under Purchase of Fixed Assets.\n\n### Let's analyze each financial statement:\n\n#### 1. **Balance Sheet**\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n\n- **Accounts Receivable**: The amount is **1,716,911.17**. This represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit.\n\n#### 2. **Income Statement**\nFrom the Income Statement:\n\n- **Financial Expenses**: The amount is **50,166.99**. This represents financing costs incurred by the enterprise.\n\n#### 3. **Cash Flow Statement**\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The amount is **0.00**. This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. Since the value is zero, it indicates no cash payments were made for this purpose in the period.\n\n### Final Output\nWith the identified values:\n\n- **Value 1** (Accounts Receivable): 1,716,911.17\n- **Value 2** (Financial Expenses): 50,166.99\n- **Value 3** (Purchase of Fixed Assets): 0.00\n\nThe format of the solution will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1716911.17', 'value2': '50166.99', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```",
