Here, the value is **$3,025,437.82**.\n\n2. **Total Revenue:** This line indicates the total income from all operations, which can include both operating and non-operating sources. In this case, it matches the value from Main Business Revenue, which still stands at **$3,025,437.82**.\n\nBoth of these items are directly related to the entity's core operating activities. \n\n3. **Cost of Goods Sold, Expenses, and Profit Figures:** Other line items, such as \"Cost of Goods Sold\", \"Total Cost\", \"Gross Profit\", \"Total Expenses\", \"Profit Before Tax\", and \"Net Profit\" are not income items but rather reflect expenses or calculated profits.\n\nFrom this analysis, the relevant value of income arising from core operating activities is found in the \"Main Business Revenue.\" \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3025437.82'} }\n```",
