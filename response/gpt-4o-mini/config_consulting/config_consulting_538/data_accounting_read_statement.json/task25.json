                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify the specific line items in the income statement related to costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers. In most income statements, these costs typically include:\n\n1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) - This represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. It includes costs such as materials and direct labor associated with the creation of the goods that were sold during the accounting period.\n\n2. Selling Expenses - These are expenses that are directly related to selling activities, which may include commissions, advertising, and all costs incurred to secure customer orders. While this does not usually encompass direct costs like COGS, it can include sales commissions.\n\nNow, let's locate the relevant line items in the provided income statement:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 1312000.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: 345311.74\n\nNext, we will sum these amounts to find the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services.\n\nCalculating the total:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Costs} = \\text{Cost of Goods Sold} + \\text{Selling Expenses} \n= 1312000.00 + 345311.74 \n= 1657311.74\n\\]\n\nFinally, we present the solution in the specified json format with the computed total costs.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1657311.74'} }\n```",
