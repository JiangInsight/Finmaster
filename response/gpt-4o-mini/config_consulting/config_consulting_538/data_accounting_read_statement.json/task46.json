Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n2. Any line items that indicate the purchase or sale of long-term assets.\n\n**Step 2: Extract Information**\nFrom the provided statement:\n\n- Under **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**, the relevant line item is:\n  \n  - **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 0.00 (This denotes no cash outflow for the purchase of fixed assets).\n\n- The **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: -0.00 (Again, this confirms that no cash was flowed out for investing activities).\n\n**Step 3: Net Amount from Cash and Cash Equivalents**\nWe also need the net amount of cash and cash equivalents which is indicated by:\n\n- **Net Increase**: 116257.19 (This would reflect the overall increase in cash and cash equivalents).\n\n**Step 4: Sub-Item Decomposition**\nFor our purpose, since the only investing activity we have is the purchase of fixed assets, we can treat that as a sub-item.\n\n- **Sub-item**: Purchase of Fixed Assets: 0.00 (The value is directly taken from the cash flow statement).\n\n**Final Aggregation**\n1. Overall **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: -0.00\n2. This indicates that there was no outflow for the stated period concerning long-term assets.\n3. The corresponding sub-item value for the purchase of fixed assets, which is 0.00.\n\n**Final Structure**\nNow, we need to format our answer in the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'} }\n```",
