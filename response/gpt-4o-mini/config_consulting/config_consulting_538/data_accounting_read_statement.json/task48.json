This represents the profit the entity retains after all operational costs, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization have been deducted from total revenue.\n\n2. **Identifying Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: \n   Next, we look for the cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, which is represented by the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\" In this case, the corresponding amount is `0.00`. This indicates that there were no cash payments for fixed assets in this period.\n\n3. **Maintaining Line Item Order**: \n   As per the instruction, we need to maintain the original order of these outputs in our solution. The first value corresponds to \"Net Profit,\" and the second value corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\nPutting this information together, we format our solution in the specified JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '963263.19', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```",
