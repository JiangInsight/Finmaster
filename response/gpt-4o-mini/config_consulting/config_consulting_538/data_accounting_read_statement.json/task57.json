According to the data, the amount for Accounts Payable is **816000.00**.\n   - **Taxes Payable**: This line item represents taxes owed, which can be seen as a liability but isn't directly related to goods or services received. The amount for Taxes Payable is **151271.87**.\n\n2. **Identifying Total Amount Owed for Goods or Services**:\n   - Since we are specifically looking at goods or services received or purchased on credit, the main focus should be on the **Accounts Payable** entry.\n\n3. **Value Extraction**:\n   - The value specifically relevant to our inquiry (the addition in the amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period) is the **Accounts Payable** amount, which is **816000.00**.\n\nThus, the value of the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is **816000.00**.\n\nThe solution in the required JSON format is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '816000.00'} }\n```",
