                        "content": "To calculate the financial ratios requested, we will use the definitions of each ratio and the components from the provided financial statements.\n\n1. **Current Ratio**: This measures a company's ability to pay its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. It is calculated as:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Quick Ratio**: This is a more stringent measure of liquidity compared to the current ratio, as it excludes inventory from current assets. It is calculated as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets - Inventory}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: This measures the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed by debt. It is calculated as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**: This measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It is calculated as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio indicates the ability of a company to cover its total debt with its cash flow from operations. It is calculated as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's extract the necessary data from the financial statements to perform these calculations.\n\n### From the Balance Sheet:\n- Total Current Assets = 10,022,038.12\n- Total Current Liabilities = 967,271.87\n- Total Assets = 14,930,535.06\n- Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity\n  - Total Owner's Equity = 13,963,263.19 → Hence, Total Liabilities = 14,930,535.06 - 13,963,263.19 = 967,271.87\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13,963,263.19\n\n### From the Cash Flow Statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = 116,257.19\n\nNow we can calculate the ratios step-by-step:\n\n1. **Current Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{10,022,038.12}{967,271.87} \\approx 10.37\n   \\]\n\n2. **Quick Ratio**:\n   - Inventory = 174,000.00\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{10,022,038.12 - 174,000.00}{967,271.87} \\approx 10.23\n   \\]\n\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{967,271.87}{14,930,535.06} \\approx 0.065\n   \\]\n\n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{967,271.87}{13,963,263.19} \\approx 0.069\n   \\]\n\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{116,257.19}{967,271.87} \\approx 0.120\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we will present the results in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '10.37', 'Quick Ratio': '10.23', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.065', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.069', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '0.120'} }\n```",
