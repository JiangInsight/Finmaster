                        "content": "To calculate the required financial ratios based on the provided financial statements, we will follow a systematic approach for each ratio using the data from the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 3025437.82 (from the income statement)\n- **Accounts Receivable (beginning)**: 0.00 (from the balance sheet)\n- **Accounts Receivable (end)**: 1716911.17 (from the balance sheet)\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 1716911.17}{2} = 858455.585\n\\]\n\nCalculating the turnover ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3025437.82}{858455.585} \\approx 3.52\n\\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio assesses the ability of the company to cover its liabilities with the cash generated from its operations.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: 116257.19 (from the cash flow statement)\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 967271.87 (from the balance sheet)\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{116257.19}{967271.87} \\approx 0.12\n\\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is another way to measure the company's ability to pay off its current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n\nHere we have the same calculation as above since the cash flow is from operations.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = 0.12\n\\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures the efficiency of a company's use of its assets to generate revenue.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\n- **Total Assets (end)**: 14930535.06 (from the balance sheet)\n- **Total Assets (beginning)**: 13000000.00 (from the balance sheet)\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{13000000.00 + 14930535.06}{2} = 13965267.53\n\\]\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3025437.82}{13965267.53} \\approx 0.22\n\\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio provides insight into a company's financial leverage and overall risk.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Equity}}\n\\]\n\n- **Total Liabilities**: 967271.87 (Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable)\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: 13963263.19 (from the balance sheet)\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{967271.87}{13963263.19} \\approx 0.069\n\\]\n\n### Final Results\nNow, we can compile these ratios into the desired JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.52', 'operating cash flow ratio': '0.12', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '0.12', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.22', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.069'} }\n```",
