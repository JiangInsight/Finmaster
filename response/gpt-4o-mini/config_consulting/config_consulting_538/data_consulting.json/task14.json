                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Calculation**: \n   The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio measures how effectively a company collects its receivables. It is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Financial Data**:\n   - From the income statement, we find the **Total Revenue** for the period, which we'll use as a proxy for **Net Credit Sales**. Here, it is **3025437.82**.\n   - From the balance sheet, we'll identify the **Accounts Receivable** amounts. \n     - At the start of the period (December 31, 2023), the amount is **0.00**.\n     - At the end of the period (February 5, 2024), the amount is **1716911.17**.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Accounts Receivable**:\n   The average accounts receivable can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable}}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 1716911.17}{2} = \\frac{1716911.17}{2} = 858455.585\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**:\n   Now we can substitute the values into the formula to find the ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3025437.82}{858455.585} \\approx 3.52\n   \\]\n\n5. **Prepare the Output**:\n   Weâ€™ll present our result in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.52'} }\n```",
