                        "content": "To calculate the total liabilities on the balance sheet based on the transactions provided, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Liabilities in the Transactions**: We will analyze each transaction to find those that increase or decrease liabilities. Specifically, liabilities generally include accounts payable, loans, and any deferred payments.\n\n2. **Sum Initial and Final Liabilities**:\n   - **Initial Liabilities**: From the transactions, we need to sum the amounts relevant to initial liabilities which might be already listed.\n   - **Final Liabilities**: This will include liabilities incurred through purchases or expenses that have not yet been paid. We will add the unpaid amounts.\n\n3. **List of Transactions**: \n   - Initial Records: These show accounts like cash deposits, fixed assets purchases but don't directly impact liabilities.\n   - Purchases (recorded as Payable): These will increase liabilities when unpaid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n#### **Initial Liabilities Calculation**:\nLooking closely only those transactions marked as \"Purchase\" or that relate to liabilities:\n- **Unpaid Purchases on 2023-12-31**:\n  - `Purchase20231231001` = 100,000.00\n  - `Purchase20231231002` = 60,000.00\n  - `Purchase20231231004` = 100,000.00\n  - `Purchase20231231006` = 100,000.00\n  - `Purchase20231231011` = 10,000.00 (as unpaid)\n  - `Purchase20231231012` = 40,000.00 (as unpaid)\n  - **Total Initial Liabilities Initial Value = 100,000 + 60,000 + 100,000 + 100,000 + 10,000 + 40,000 = 410,000.00**\n\n#### **Final Liabilities Calculation**:\nIdentifying ongoing liabilities through unpaid amounts from entries following 2024-01-01 up to 2024-02-05:\n- These will be accounted from \"Purchase\" or \"Expense\" transactions:\n  - `Purchase20231231003` = 15,000.00 (paid, not include)\n  - `Purchase20231231004` = 100,000.00 (unpaid)\n  - `Purchase20231231005` = 100,00.00 (Paid, not include)\n  - `Purchase20231231006` = 100,000.00 (unpaid from previous purchases)\n  - `Purchase20231231007` = 5,000.00 (Paid, not include)\n  - `Purchase20231231008` = 40,000.00 (unpaid)\n  - `Purchase20231231019` = 2,000.00 (Payable, unpaid)\n  - `Purchase20231231021` = 40,000.00 (current fees unpaid)\n  \nAdding these gives us the total liabilities ending value based on entries in that timeline: \n\n- **Sum of Unpaid Liabilities** = 100,000 + 100,000 + 60,000 + 50,000 + 40,000 + 20,000 = 470,000.00\n\n### Final Values:\n- Initial Liabilities value = 410,000.00\n- End Liabilities = 470,000.00\n\nFinally, we format the output as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '410000.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '470000.00'}}\n```",
