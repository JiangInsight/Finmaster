                        "content": "To calculate the fixed assets net amount for the initial and end values from the provided data, we need to summarize the following components:\n\n1. **Initial Fixed Assets Value**: This can be directly read from the initial entries.\n2. **Purchases of Fixed Assets**: Adds value to fixed assets.\n3. **Depreciation**: Reduces the value of fixed assets.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Initial Fixed Assets Value\nFrom the provided data, we can see three entries marked as \"Fixed Assets\":\n\n- Initial Value: 5,000,000.00 (This is our starting point)\n\n### Step 2: Identify Purchases of Fixed Assets\nWe need to look through the transactions for any purchases that increase the fixed assets. From the transactional data (type marked as \"Purchase\"), we have the following related to fixed assets:\n\n**Purchases:**\n- Purchase for Fixed Assets (not tagged with the type \"Fixed Assets\" but implying an addition to assets based on the descriptions):\n  - Purchase for 100,000.00\n  - Purchase for 60,000.00\n  - Purchase for 15,000.00\n  - Purchase for 100,000.00\n  - Purchase for 100,000.00\n  - Purchase for 300,000.00\n  - Purchase for 40,000.00\n\nAdding these up:\n- Total Purchases = 100,000 + 60,000 + 15,000 + 100,000 + 100,000 + 300,000 + 40,000 = 715,000.00\n\n### Step 3: Identify Depreciation\nNow, we need to account for depreciation which subtracts from the value of fixed assets:\n\n**Depreciation:**\n- Depreciation for 45,752.22\n- Depreciation for 45,750.84\n\nAdding the depreciation:\n- Total Depreciation = 45,752.22 + 45,750.84 = 91,503.06\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Final Values\nNow, we can calculate both the initial and final values:\n\n- **Initial Fixed Assets Value**: 5,000,000.00\n- **Final Fixed Assets Value Calculation**:\n  \n    Final Fixed Assets = Initial Value + Total Purchases - Total Depreciation\n    = 5,000,000 + 715,000 - 91,503.06\n    = 5,000,000 + 715,000 - 91,503.06\n    = 5,623,496.94\n\n### Final Result in Required Format\nNow that we have both values, we can construct the final output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'fixed assets net Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'fixed assets net End Value': '5623496.94'} }\n```",
