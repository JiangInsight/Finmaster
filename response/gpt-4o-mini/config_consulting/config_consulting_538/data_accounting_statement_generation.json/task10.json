                        "content": "To determine the total non-current assets' initial and final values based on the provided transactions, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Non-current Assets\nIn the initial data, we see three major entries that represent non-current assets:\n\n1. **Fixed Assets**: 5,000,000\n2. **Purchase** entries for various assets:\n   - 100,000 (Purchased: Enterprise Solution)\n   - 60,000 (Purchased: Premium Consulting)\n   - Multiple purchases below this value, which are not directly labeled as fixed assets, will not contribute to the non-current assets total.\n  \nTherefore, we will only consider the fixed assets in the initial value.\n\n### Initial Non-current Assets Calculation:\n- The **Initial Non-current Assets** = 5,000,000 (Fixed Assets)\n\n### Step 2: Process Transactions Affecting Non-current Assets\nNow we will analyze all the transactions one by one to identify any impacts on non-current assets.\n\n1. **Purchases and Sales of Fixed Assets**:\n   - Purchased Enterprise Solutions (100,000)\n   - Purchased Premium Consulting (60,000).\n   - Hence, new fixed assets are increasing by a total of 160,000.\n   - Also, observe **Depreciation** amounts which will reduce the total asset value.\n\n2. **Depreciation**:\n   - Depreciation entries are listed with amounts, such as:\n     - 45,752.22 (for the year 2024)\n   - The most recent depreciation will be deducted from the total asset value.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Final Non-current Assets\nNow, we sum up the purchases and deduct the depreciation from the original value.\n\n### Transactions Summary to be included in Final Value:\n- **Initial Value of Fixed Assets**: 5,000,000\n- **Total Purchases (as added to Fixed Assets)**: 100,000 + 60,000 = 160,000\n- **Total Depreciation**: (45,752.22) for the evaluation period\n\n### Final Value Calculation:\n- **Final Non-current Assets**:\n  - Initial Assets + Purchases - Depreciation\n  - Total = 5,000,000 + 160,000 - 45,752.22\n  - Total = 5,114,247.78\n\n### Step 4: Final Output\nLet's format the results into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5114247.78'} }\n```\n\n### Note\nMake sure that the final amount is accurately calculated based on all relevant entries for purchases and depreciation to ensure correctness in reporting non-current assets.",
