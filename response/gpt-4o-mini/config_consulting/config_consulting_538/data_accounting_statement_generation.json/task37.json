In the later entries:\n     ```\n     | Depreciation20240201002 | Depreciation | 2024-02-01 | 2024-02-01 | 45750.84 | 45750.84 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n     ```\n   - Another amount to consider for depreciation is **45750.84**.\n\n4. **Conclude on the Final Depreciation Amount**:\n   - Given that we are looking for the most recent depreciation amount as indicated in the task, we take the newer date's amount.\n   - Therefore, the final recorded depreciation amount relevant for the cash flow statement is **45750.84**.\n\n5. **Prepare the Solution**:\n   - Craft the solution in the requested format for final output.\n\nThus, the response is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45750.84'} }\n```",
