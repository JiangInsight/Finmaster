COGS is determined by the cost incurred in producing the goods that were sold during a certain period.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Purchase Transactions\nFrom the problem dataset, we look for all Purchase records, as these represent the costs associated with acquiring inventory.\n\n### Step 2: Total Up Purchase Costs\nWe will sum the `cost_amount` of all purchases. Here are the relevant Purchase entries:\n1. **Purchase20231231001**: cost_amount = 10000.0\n2. **Purchase20231231002**: cost_amount = 10000.0\n3. **Purchase20231231004**: cost_amount = 20000.0\n4. **Purchase20231231008**: cost_amount = 5000.0\n5. **Purchase20231231009**: cost_amount = 20000.0\n6. **Purchase20231231010**: cost_amount = 20000.0\n7. **Purchase20231231012**: cost_amount = 5000.0\n8. **Purchase20231231013**: cost_amount = 2000.0\n9. **Purchase20231231014**: cost_amount = 20000.0\n10. **Purchase20231231015**: cost_amount = 20000.0\n11. **Purchase20231231016**: cost_amount = 40000.0\n12. **Purchase20231231017**: cost_amount = 2000.0\n13. **Purchase20231231018**: cost_amount = 100000.0\n14. **Purchase20231231019**: cost_amount = 20000.0\n15. **Purchase20231231020**: cost_amount = 1000.0\n16. **Purchase20231231021**: cost_amount = 1000.0\n17. **Purchase20231231022**: cost_amount = 1000.0\n18. **Purchase20231231026**: cost_amount = 10000.0\n19. **Purchase20231231027**: cost_amount = 5000.0\n20. **Purchase20231231028**: cost_amount = 200000.0\n21. **Purchase20231231029**: cost_amount = 3000.0\n\n### Step 3: Sum COGS\nNow we add them all together:\n- 10000.0 + 10000.0 + 20000.0 + 5000.0 + 20000.0 + 20000.0 + 5000.0 + 2000.0 + 20000.0 + 20000.0 + 40000.0 + 2000.0 + 100000.0 + 20000.0 + 1000.0 + 1000.0 + 1000.0 + 10000.0 + 5000.0 + 200000.0 + 3000.0 = **405000.0**\n\n### Step 4: Identify Sale Transactions\nNext, we would normally tally up sold items if needed, which would primarily involve finding the `quantity` sold multiplied by the cost, but since we've already broken down each purchase's cost, totaling the purchase amounts gives us the total cost of goods sold as items are sold at these intrinsic costs.\n\n### Conclusion\nConsequently, our calculated Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is derived from the summary of all purchases, leading to:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '405000.00'} }\n```",
