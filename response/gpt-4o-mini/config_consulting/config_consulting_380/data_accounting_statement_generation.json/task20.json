                        "content": "To create the complete balance sheet based on the provided transactions and compute the initial and final amounts for various accounts, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Set initial values for cash accounts, accounts receivable, fixed assets, liabilities, and equity.\n\n2. **Processing Transactions**: Parse through the transaction records to adjust the values based on their types (sales, expenses, purchases, etc.).\n\n3. **Adjusting Balances**: For each type of transaction, modify the initial values accordingly and compute the end values.\n\n4. **Final Balance Calculation**: Summarize the ending balances into a formatted JSON structure.\n\n### Step 1: Initialization of Initial Values\n\nBased on the transactions provided at the beginning:\n\n- **Cash on Hand**: 3,000,000.00\n- **Bank Deposits**: 5,000,000.00\n- **Interest Receivable**: 0.00\n- **Accounts Receivable**: 0.00\n- **Inventory**: 0.00 (assumed as no inventory records present)\n- **Total Current Assets**: 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 8,000,000.00\n- **Fixed Assets**: 5,000,000.00\n- **Accumulated Depreciation**: 0.00\n- **Total Non-current Assets**: 5,000,000.00\n- **Total Assets**: 8,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.00\n- **Accounts Payable**: 0.00 (initial state)\n- **Taxes Payable**: 0.00 (initial state)\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 0.00\n- **Paid-in Capital**: 13,000,000.00 (initial investment)\n- **Retained Earnings**: 0.00\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: 13,000,000.00\n\n### Step 2 & 3: Processing Transactions\n\nGo through each transaction:\n\n- For **Sales**, increase cash (or accounts receivable) and increase retained earnings (profit).\n- For **Purchases**, increase accounts payable and decrease cash or increase fixed assets depending on cash payment vs. credit.\n- For **Expenses**, decrease cash and decrease retained earnings.\n\n### Simplified Calculation Logic\n\n1. **For each Sale**: Adjust cash or accounts receivable and increase retained earnings.\n2. **For each Expense**: Adjust cash and reduce retained earnings.\n3. **For Purchases**: Adjust cash or accounts payable based on payment status.\n4. **For Depreciation**: Adjust accumulated depreciation and decrease retained earnings.\n\n### Final Calculations\n\nAfter processing all transactions, compute the following:\n\n- **Cash on Hand**: Running balance after all cash inflows/outflows.\n- **Bank Deposits**: Running balance after all bank transactions.\n- **Interest Receivable**: Adjusts for current interest revenues recognized but unpaid.\n- **Accounts Receivable**: Adjusts for sales on credit.\n- **Inventory**: Currently at 0.00 (assumed).\n- **Total Current Assets**: Sum of cash on hand, bank deposits, accounts receivable, and inventory.\n- **Fixed Assets**: Remain as they were initially reported minus accumulated depreciation.\n- **Accumulated Depreciation**: Increase based on the provided depreciations.\n- **Total Non-current Assets**: Fixed Assets minus accumulated depreciation.\n- **Total Assets**: Total Current Assets plus Total Non-current Assets.\n- **Accounts Payable**: Maintains liabilities from purchases made on credit.\n- **Taxes Payable**: If noted, otherwise assumed as 0.00.\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: Sum of all current liabilities (includes accounts payable).\n- **Paid-in Capital**: Remains unchanged at the initial investment value.\n- **Retained Earnings**: Adjusts with total profits from sales minus total expenses.\n\n### Final JSON Representation\n\nLet's compile the final values based on the adjustments made during processing:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Cash on Hand Initial Value\": \"3000000.00\",\n    \"Bank Deposits Initial Value\":
