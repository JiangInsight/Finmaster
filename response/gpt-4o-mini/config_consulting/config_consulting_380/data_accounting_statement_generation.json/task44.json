Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Transactions**: We need to focus on rows where the `type` or `asset_type` includes 'Fixed Assets', 'Asset Purchase', or similar relevant identifiers indicating the acquisition of fixed assets.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Amounts**: For those identified transactions, we will total the `amount` or `after_tax_amount`, focusing on transactions that are categorized as fixed asset purchases.\n\n3. **Calculate Total**: Sum the amounts identified in step 2 to get the final total for the purchase of fixed assets.\n\nNow, let's go through the provided dataset for transactions:\n\n- We will scan each row looking for types or asset types related to fixed assets:\n  - There are several entries indicating fixed asset purchases, like:\n    - The first relevant entry is found at **FixedAsset20231231001** with an `amount` of **85889.19**.\n    - There is also another entry at **Purchase20231231011** with an `amount` of **300000.0**.\n\nCombining these values:\n- Total purchase for fixed assets:\n  - 85889.19 (from Fixed Asset costs)\n  - 300000.0 (from Enterprise Solutions)\n\nNow, summing these amounts:\n- \\( 85889.19 + 300000.0 = 385889.19 \\)\n\n### Presenting Solution\nNow I'll present this total in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '385889.19'} }\n```",
