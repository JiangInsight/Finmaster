                        "content": "To solve the task, we will calculate the required financial ratios based on the provided financial statements. Let's break down each ratio step by step.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThe Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables. It is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}} \\]\n\n- Total Revenue from Income Statement: 2,637,011.03\n- Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning Accounts Receivable + Ending Accounts Receivable) / 2 = (0 + 2,117,339.65) / 2 = 1,058,669.83\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{2,637,011.03}{1,058,669.83} \\approx 2.49 \\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by cash flows from operations. It is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -1,028,375.55 (from cash flow statement)\n- Current Liabilities: 378,850.51 (from balance sheet)\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{378,850.51} \\approx -2.71 \\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio is the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio since it's defined similarly. Hence:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{378,850.51} \\approx -2.71 \\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThe Total Asset Turnover Ratio measures the efficiency of a company's use of its assets to generate sales revenue. It is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}} \\]\n\n- Total Revenue: 2,637,011.03\n- Average Total Assets = (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2 = (13,000,000 + 14,214,117.02) / 2 = 13,607,058.51\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{2,637,011.03}{13,607,058.51} \\approx 0.19 \\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its total shareholders' equity. It is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Equity}} \\]\n\n- Total Liabilities: 378,850.51 (from balance sheet)\n- Total Equity: 13,835,266.51 (from balance sheet)\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{378,850.51}{13,835,266.51} \\approx 0.027 \\]\n\n### Summary of Calculated Ratios\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 2.49\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -2.71\n- Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -2.71\n- Total Asset Turnover Ratio: 0.19\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.027 \n\nNow, we'll format these results in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.49', \n    'operating cash flow ratio': '-2.71', \n    'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-2.71', \n    'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.19', \n    'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.027'\n}}\n```",
