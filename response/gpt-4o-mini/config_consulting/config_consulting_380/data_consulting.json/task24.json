                        "content": "To calculate the \"Debt to Asset Ratio\" and \"Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\" from the provided financial statements, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet section, we can extract:\n\n- **Total Assets**: 14,214,117.02\n- **Total Liabilities**: This can be calculated by subtracting Total Owner's Equity from Total Assets.\n\nTotal Owner's Equity is provided as:\n\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: 13,835,266.51\n\nTherefore, we can calculate Total Liabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Assets} - \\text{Total Owner's Equity} = 14,214,117.02 - 13,835,266.51 = 378,850.51\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{378,850.51}{14,214,117.02} \\approx 0.0266\n\\]\n\nConverting to a more readable format by multiplying by 100 gives approximately 2.66%.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -1,028,375.55\n- **Net Income**: 835,266.51 (from the income statement)\n\nNow plug these values into the formula. Note, however, that we'll use the absolute value of the net cash flow since the ratio typically compares magnitudes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-1,028,375.55}{835,266.51} \\approx -1.23\n\\]\n\nWhile this is a negative ratio, often it's expressed in terms of its absolute value or as a duration of coverage ratio; therefore, we present this as a positive number:\n\nTo calculate as a ratio we will express this as:\n\n\\[\n|-1.23| \\approx 1.23\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nPutting these values into the specified JSON format, we will round Debt to Asset Ratio to two decimal places and Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio to two decimal places as well.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.03', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '1.23'}}\n```",
