                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to calculate the four financial metrics: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, Return on Assets (ROA), and Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio using the data provided in the financial statements: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement. \n\n### Step 1: Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total owner's equity.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity\n\nGiven:\n- Total Assets = 14214117.02\n- Total Owner's Equity = 13835266.51\n\nCalculating Total Liabilities:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Liabilities} = 14214117.02 - 13835266.51 = 378850.51\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} = \\frac{378850.51}{13835266.51} \\approx 0.027\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Net Profit Margin\n\nThe Net Profit Margin is calculated as the Net Profit divided by Total Revenue, expressed as a percentage.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 835266.51\n- Total Revenue = 2637011.03\n\nCalculating the Net Profit Margin:\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 = \\frac{835266.51}{2637011.03} \\times 100 \\approx 31.69\\%\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Return on Assets (ROA)\n\nROA is calculated as Net Profit divided by Total Assets, expressed as a percentage.\n\nUsing the values we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Return on Assets (ROA)} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\times 100 = \\frac{835266.51}{14214117.02} \\times 100 \\approx 5.88\\%\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\nThe Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio measures how efficiently a company collects its receivables and is calculated as Total Revenue divided by Average Accounts Receivable.\n\nFor simplicity, we'll use the ending accounts receivable value since average accounts receivable calculations typically use beginning and ending figures, but we do not have beginning figures here. Therefore, we will take the end amount directly.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Total Revenue = 2637011.03\n- Accounts Receivable (end) = 2117339.65\n\nCalculating the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Accounts Receivable}} = \\frac{2637011.03}{2117339.65} \\approx 1.24\n\\]\n\n### Final results\n\nTo summarize our calculations:\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.027 (or rounded to '0.03' for better readability)\n- Net Profit Margin: 31.69% (or '31.69')\n- Return on Assets (ROA): 5.88% (or '5.88')\n- Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 1.24 (or rounded to '1.24')\n\n### Final Output\nNow we can include these results in the desired JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '31.69%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '5.88%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '1.24'}}\n```",
