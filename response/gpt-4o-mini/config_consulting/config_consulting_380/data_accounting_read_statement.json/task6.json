                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify and extract the values associated with tangible items that are intended for use in production or supply of goods or services, rental to others, or for administrative purposes from the provided balance sheet data.\n\nLet's analyze the accounts listed:\n\n1. **Cash on Hand**: Generally not considered a tangible asset used for production.\n2. **Bank Deposits**: Also not a tangible asset.\n3. **Interest Receivable**: Not a tangible asset.\n4. **Accounts Receivable**: Represents money owed by customers, not tangible assets.\n5. **Inventory**: Represents tangible goods held for sale; this is a tangible asset for production/supply.\n6. **Total Current Assets**: This figure aggregates current assets but doesn’t specify individual items.\n7. **Fixed Assets**: This includes property, buildings, equipment etc., which are tangible.\n8. **Accumulated Depreciation**: This offsets fixed assets but isn’t a tangible asset itself.\n9. **Total Non-current Assets**: Again, like total current assets, this just aggregates non-current assets but doesn’t specify.\n10. **Total Assets**: An aggregate of all assets, not relevant for tangible asset identification.\n11. **Accounts Payable**: A liability, not an asset.\n12. **Taxes Payable**: Another liability, not applicable.\n13. **Total Current Liabilities**: Not relevant as it only lists liabilities.\n14. **Paid-in Capital**: Equity, not a tangible asset.\n15. **Retained Earnings**: Equity item only.\n16. **Total Owner's Equity**: Aggregate of equity, not relevant here.\n17. **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity**: Another aggregate figure that is not useful for our needs.\n\nFrom this analysis, the relevant tangible items are:\n\n- **Inventory** with the initial value of `0.00` and the end value of `203000.00`.\n- **Fixed Assets** with the initial value of `5000000.00` and the end value of `5085889.19`.\n\nNow, we'll extract the initial and end values for both tangible assets. The initial value of Fixed Assets is `5000000.00`, and the end value is `5085889.19`. Inventory only has an end value and doesn't contribute to initial tangible asset balance because it's represented as `0.00`. We will take the values associated with Fixed Assets as the primary relevant tangible assets held for production.\n\nThus, the solution will include:\n\n- Initial value: `5000000.00` from Fixed Assets.\n- End value: `5085889.19` from Fixed Assets.\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format will be presented as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5085889.19'}}\n```",
