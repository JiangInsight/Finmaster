This is typically represented as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" \"Capital Expenditures,\" or similar terminology.\n3. **Extract the Value**: In the provided example, the relevant line reads:\n   - **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 85889.19\n\nThis indicates that the cash payment to acquire property, plant, and equipment (or other long-term assets) is 85889.19.\n\nTherefore, we present the extracted value in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '85889.19'} }\n```",
