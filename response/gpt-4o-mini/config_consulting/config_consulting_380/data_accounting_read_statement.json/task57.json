The relevant entries here are:\n\n- **Accounts Payable**: Shows the amount the entity owes to its suppliers or creditors for goods and services received but not yet paid for.\n- **Taxes Payable**: Shows amount owed in taxes.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Accounts Payable**: 247000.00 (this indicates the addition to liabilities for goods or services received on credit)\n- **Taxes Payable**: 131850.51 (this shows tax obligations but is not related to goods or services on credit)\n\n### Cash Flow Analysis\n\nThe cash flow from operations also indicates increases or decreases in accounts payable and taxes payable due to cash flows. Here:\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: 247000.00 (this aligns with the accounts payable from the balance sheet)\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**: 131850.51 (again, not relevant here)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince we need to specify only the account for goods or services purchased on credit, we focus on Accounts Payable. The value indicating how much the entity owes for those purchases is:\n\n`247000.00`\n\n### Final Answer in Required JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '247000.00'} }\n```",
