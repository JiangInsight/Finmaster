This is the value recorded at the initial date, which is `2023-12-31`.\n\n3. **End Value**: The end amount for \"Taxes Payable\" is provided as `131850.51`. This reflects the amount recorded at the end date, which is `2024-02-05`.\n\n4. **Presenting the Values**: Now that we have identified both the initial and the end values for taxes payable, we will format these into the specified JSON structure.\n\nThe final extraction, including both the initial and the end amounts, will be presented as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '131850.51'} }\n```",
