                        "content": "To solve the problem, I need to identify if there's a specific line item in the provided cash flow statement that indicates a reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business. The key thing to look for is any mention of \"assets held for sale,\" \"inventory,\" or any term related to producing goods for sale or manufacturing processes that shows a reduction.\n\nLooking at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n1. The statement starts with cash flow from operating activities.\n2. Under operating activities, there are line items for:\n    - Net Profit\n    - Depreciation\n    - (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\n    - (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable\n    - **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: This line item has a value of -203000.00, which indicates a decrease in inventory.\n\nUnder typical interpretations, inventory reductions would imply a decrease in assets available for sale as it's a crucial component of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThe other line items do not reflect a reduction related to assets held for sale.\n\nTherefore, the relevant line item for reduction in assets held for sale was identified as:\n\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: -203000.00\n\nTo summarize, the amount reflecting the reduction in assets held for sale is -203000.00.\n\nNow, I will format the solution as requested!\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-203000.00'} }\n```",
