We are looking for two specific cost-related values:\n\n1. Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services (this is typically represented as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the Income Statement).\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets (commonly listed as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement).\n\nNow, letâ€™s identify these items from the provided financial statements:\n\n### Balance Sheet\nFrom the balance sheet provided, there are no relevant line items for costs to secure customer orders or cash payments for property, plant, and equipment.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The relevant line item here is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\", with the value:\n  ```\n  Purchase of Fixed Assets: 85889.19\n  ```\n\n### Income Statement\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: The relevant line item here is \"Cost of Goods Sold\", with the value:\n  ```\n  Cost of Goods Sold: 1015000.00\n  ```\n\nNow that we have identified the values:\n\n- **Value1 (Cost of Goods Sold)**: 1015000.00\n- **Value2 (Purchase of Fixed Assets)**: 85889.19\n\nConsolidating these findings, we can populate the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1015000.00', 'value2': '85889.19'}}\n```",
