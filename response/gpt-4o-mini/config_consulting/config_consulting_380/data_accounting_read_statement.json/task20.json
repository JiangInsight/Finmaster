The key line item in an income statement that corresponds to the cost associated with goods sold (including inventories) is typically labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\nFrom the given problem, the relevant portion of the income statement is as follows:\n\n| Account              | Amount       | Date        |\n|---------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Cost of Goods Sold  | 1015000.00  | 2024-02-05  |\n\nThe \"Cost of Goods Sold\" here is $1,015,000.00, which represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nAccordingly, we will present this value in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1015000.00'} }\n```",
