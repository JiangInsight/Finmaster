We're looking for the net cash from investing activities related to acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents, as well as the receipt of interest and dividends.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant accounts**: We need to look specifically at the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\" In the statement provided:\n   - The relevant line item under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is reported as `85889.19`.\n\n2. **Calculate the Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: According to the statement:\n   - The \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is reported as `-85889.19`. This negative value indicates cash outflow, which is consistent with the purchase of fixed assets.\n\n3. **Identify the sub-item**: The sub-item in this case is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which generates the cash outflow of `85889.19`.\n\nNow let's summarize the findings:\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities = `-85889.19`\n- The sub-item contributing to this cash flow is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" with a value of `85889.19`.\n\nBased on these calculations, we can present the answer in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-85889.19', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '85889.19'}}\n```",
