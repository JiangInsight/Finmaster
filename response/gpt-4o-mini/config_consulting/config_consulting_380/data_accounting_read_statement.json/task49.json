Our goal is to find the amounts for:\n\n1. Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period (this corresponds to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\").\n2. Acquisition of property, plant, and equipment (this corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\").\n3. Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period (this corresponds to \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\").\n\nLet's analyze the provided cash flow statement step by step.\n\n### Given Cash Flow Statement:\n\n| Account                                   | Amount        | Date         |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities        |               | 2024-02-05   |\n| Net Profit                                | 835266.51     | 2024-02-05   |\n| Depreciation                              | 92870.67      | 2024-02-05   |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable | -2117339.65   | 2024-02-05   |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable | -15023.59     | 2024-02-05   |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory          | -203000.00    | 2024-02-05   |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable   | 247000.00     | 2024-02-05   |  <-- This is what we need\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable        | 131850.51     | 2024-02-05   |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities    | -1028375.55   | 2024-02-05   |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities        |               | 2024-02-05   |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets                  | 85889.19      | 2024-02-05   |  <-- This is what we need\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities    | -85889.19     | 2024-02-05   |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents                 |               | 2024-02-05   |\n| Beginning Balance                          | 8000000.00    | 2024-02-05   |  <-- This is what we need\n| Ending Balance                             | 6885735.26    | 2024-02-05   |\n| Net Increase                               | -1114264.74   | 2024-02-05   |\n\n\n### Extracted Values:\n1. **Addition in the amount owed for goods or services**: \n   - From the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\": **247000.00**.\n   \n2. **Acquisition of property, plant, and equipment**: \n   - From the line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": **85889.19**.\n   \n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: \n   - From the line item \"Beginning Balance\": **8000000.00**.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter gathering the values successfully, we will format them into the required JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '247000.00', 'value2': '85889.19', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
