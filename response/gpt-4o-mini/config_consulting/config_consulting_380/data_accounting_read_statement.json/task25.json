                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify the line items that represent the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers. In typical income statements, this information is generally represented by the following line items:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This item clearly reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. It includes costs for materials and labor directly tied to product production.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses**: This category accounts for costs incurred to secure customer orders. It can include costs related to marketing, sales commissions, and other expenses aimed at driving sales.\n\nNow we will extract the relevant amounts from the provided income statement:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 1015000.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: 402699.98\n\nThe total costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services can be calculated by summing these two amounts:\n\nTotal Costs = Cost of Goods Sold + Selling Expenses\nTotal Costs = 1015000.00 + 402699.98\nTotal Costs = 1417699.98\n\nIn conclusion, the relevant value that encompasses the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services is **1417699.98**.\n\nTherefore, the answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1417699.98'} }\n```",
