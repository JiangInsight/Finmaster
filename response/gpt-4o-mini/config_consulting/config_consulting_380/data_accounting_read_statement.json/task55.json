We can find this information in the financial statements provided: the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Financial Statements**:\n   - The balance sheet provides a snapshot of assets, liabilities, and equity, but the key information about tax liability would most likely be found in the income statement.\n   - The cash flow statement helps understand cash movements but is not central to our search for tax information.\n   - The income statement provides a breakdown of income and expenses, including taxes.\n\n2. **Locate Tax Information**:\n   - Review the **income statement** section. We specifically look for the \"Tax Expense\" line item. This line typically represents the tax amount that the company expects to pay based on its taxable income for the reporting period.\n   - In the provided income statement, we see:\n     - Tax Expense: 131850.51\n\n3. **Extract Tax Value**:\n   - The total tax amount to be paid or recovered during this period is 131850.51.\n\n4. **Format the answer in the Expected JSON Format**:\n   - We encapsulate our findings in the specified JSON format.\n\nThus, the final JSON response is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '131850.51'} }\n```",
