These are the types of assets that remain with the entity and are used over prolonged periods rather than being liquidated or sold off in the short term.\n\nHere are the steps taken to identify and extract the relevant information:\n\n1. **Identify Line Items:** The relevant line items under non-current assets are:\n   - Fixed Assets\n   - Accumulated Depreciation\n\n2. **Values for Extraction:**\n   - Initial value from Fixed Assets: 5000000.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - End value from Fixed Assets: 5085889.19 (as of 2024-02-05)\n   - Initial value from Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00 (no entry before)\n   - End value from Accumulated Depreciation: 92870.67 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n3. **Calculate Total Non-current Assets:**\n   - Total Non-current Assets at Initial: 5000000.00\n   - Total Non-current Assets at End: 4993018.52\n\n4. **Final Selection of Values:**\n   - From the Fixed Assets (not intended for sale) and any depreciation considered, it's the fixed assets upon which our attention falls.\n\nFinalizing these details, we summarize our solution as follows:\n\nInitial value of Fixed Assets: 5000000.00\nEnd value of Fixed Assets: 5085889.19\n\nTherefore, we represent our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5085889.19'} }\n```",
