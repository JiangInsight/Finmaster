The corresponding end value is **15023.59**, consistent with the balance sheet.\n   - However, since we need the interest accrued which is represented in the balance sheet as Accounts Receivable, we will stay with that single value.\n\n### Grouping the Outputs:\n\n- In the final output, the extracted values are organized by financial statement type:\n  - **Balance Sheet**: 15023.59 (for Interest Receivable)\n  - **Income Statement**: 15023.59 (but it's redundant as we already picked it from Balance Sheet, not needed)\n  - **Cash Flow Statement**: -1114264.74 (for Net Increase in cash and cash equivalents)\n\nAfter reviewing and gathering the necessary values, we can confirm:\n\nFinal Values:\n- Interest Accrued: **15023.59**\n- Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: **-1114264.74**\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\nNow we can present the values in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '15023.59', 'value2': '-1114264.74'} }\n```",
