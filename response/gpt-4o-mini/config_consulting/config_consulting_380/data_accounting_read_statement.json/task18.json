Cash held by the entity (available for use in day-to-day operations).\n2. Tangible items held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, rental to others, or administrative purposes (this would typically be inventory as per standard accounting terminology).\n3. The amount of tax accrued but not yet paid (this refers to taxes payable).\n\nLet's find these line items with their initial and end amounts from the balance sheet.\n\n### Analyzed line items:\n\n1. **Cash on Hand**\n   - Initial Amount: **3000000.00**\n   - End Amount: **2602624.45**\n   \n2. **Inventory**\n   - Initial Amount: **0.00**\n   - End Amount: **203000.00**\n   \n3. **Taxes Payable**\n   - Initial Amount: **0.00**\n   - End Amount: **131850.51**\n\nThese line items have been identified in the order given in the problem statement.\n\n### Constructing the JSON Output:\n\nNow, we can format our output according to the specified JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '3000000.00', 'end valu1': '2602624.45', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '203000.00', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '131850.51'}}\n```\n\nThis JSON output captures the initial and end values for the three required categories as per the task.",
