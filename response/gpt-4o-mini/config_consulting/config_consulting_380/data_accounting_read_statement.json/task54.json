According to the standard accounting nomenclature, this is typically represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\" line item. \n\nHere's the relevant information extracted:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: **1,015,000.00**\n\nThis value reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold to customers. It includes costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver those goods.\n\nThere are other expenses such as administrative and selling expenses, but they either don't directly relate to the costs of delivering goods/services or represent other operational efficiencies.\n\nNow, summarizing the extracted information:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1015000.00'}}\n```",
