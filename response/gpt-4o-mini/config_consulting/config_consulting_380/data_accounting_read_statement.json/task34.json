In the provided statement, this value is found under \"Total Revenue.\"\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period** - The relevant line item for this is \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which represents the cost associated with the inventory that has been sold during the reporting period.\n\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole** - This value typically comes from \"Administrative Expenses,\" which details the costs related to managing the overall operations of the business.\n\nNow, let's extract these values from the provided income statement:\n\n- **Total Income (Total Revenue)**: 2637011.03\n- **Carrying Amount of Inventories Sold (Cost of Goods Sold)**: 1015000.00\n- **Costs of General Management and Administration (Administrative Expenses)**: 136536.97\n\nNow we can format our extracted values into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2637011.03', 'value2': '1015000.00', 'value3': '136536.97'} }\n```",
