However, since we are focusing on the total amounts owed, we can summarize as follows:\n\n- The initial value of amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit (combining both accounts) was 0.00.\n- The total end value of amounts owed is the sum of the end values of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable, which is 247000.00 + 131850.51 = 378850.51.\n\nFinally, presenting the solution in the required format, we will show the initial value as 0.00 and the final value as 378850.51 for amounts owed due to goods or services received on credit.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '378850.51'}}\n```",
