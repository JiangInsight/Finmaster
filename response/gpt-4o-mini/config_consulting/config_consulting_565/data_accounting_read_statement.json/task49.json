The line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" has an amount of **302000.00**.\n2. The line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" has an amount of **0.00**.\n3. The line item \"Beginning Balance\" has an amount of **8000000.00**.\n\nNow we can compile these values into the required JSON format. The values in the order requested are:\n- **value1 for Increase in Accounts Payable**: 302000.00\n- **value2 for Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 0.00\n- **value3 for Beginning Balance**: 8000000.00\n\nHere is the formatted solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '302000.00', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
