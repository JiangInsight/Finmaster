In this case, the \"Accumulated Depreciation\" line item shows an end amount of **91503.27**.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**: The line item \"Depreciation\" also appears and reflects the depreciation expense for the reporting period. Here, it indicates a value of **91503.27**.\n\n3. **Income Statement**: The \"Depreciation\" line item again shows the same amount as in the cash flow statement, which is **91503.27**.\n\nGiven that all these statements confirm the depreciation recognized:\n\n- The value extracted for the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of the asset over its useful life is **91503.27**.\n\nFinalizing the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91503.27'} }\n```",
