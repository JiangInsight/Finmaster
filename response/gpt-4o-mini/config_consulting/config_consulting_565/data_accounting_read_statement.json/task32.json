Here is the breakdown based on the income statement provided:\n\n1. **Total Revenue**: This represents the total income generated by the business, which is $3,956,433.90.\n\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This is the direct cost attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company, which is $1,684,000.00.\n\n3. **Total Expenses**: This is the cumulative amount spent to run the business, which is $699,089.28. It includes:\n   - Administrative Expenses: $165,230.64\n   - Selling Expenses: $360,961.15\n   - Depreciation: $91,503.27\n   - Financial Expenses: $81,394.22\n\n4. **Interest Income**: This is additional income earned from financial activities amounting to $15,414.09.\n\n5. **Tax Expense**: This is the amount deducted for tax obligations, which is $197,821.72.\n\n6. **Profit Before Tax**: This is calculated as Total Revenue minus Total Expenses plus Interest Income, amounting to $1,588,758.71.\n\n7. **Net Profit**: This is the final profit after deducting Tax Expense from Profit Before Tax, resulting in $1,390,936.99.\n\nNow we can extract the Net Profit value and the 5 components used to calculate it along with their initial and final amounts:\n\n- **Net Profit Value**: $1,390,936.99\n- **Sub-items**:\n  1. **Total Revenue**: Initial = $3,956,433.90, Final = $3,956,433.90\n  2. **Total Expenses**: Initial = $699,089.28, Final = $699,089.28\n  3. **Interest Income**: Initial = $15,414.09, Final = $15,414.09\n  4. **Tax Expense**: Initial = $197,821.72, Final = $197,821.72\n  5. **Profit Before Tax**: Initial = $1,588,758.71, Final = $1,588,758.71\n\nPutting it all together, the solution can be formatted as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1390936.99', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '3956433.90', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '699089.28', 'sub_items_sub_item value3': '15414.09', 'sub_items_sub_item value4': '197821.72', 'sub_items_sub_item value5': '1588758.71'}}\n```",
