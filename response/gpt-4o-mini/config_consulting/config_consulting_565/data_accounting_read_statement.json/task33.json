The value of income arising from the entity's core operating activities, which is represented by \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\nLet's examine the provided income statement:\n\n```\n| Account                   | Amount     | Date         |\n|--------------------------|------------|--------------|\n| Main Business Revenue     | 3956433.90 | 2024-02-05   |\n| Total Revenue             | 3956433.90 | 2024-02-05   |\n| Cost of Goods Sold        | 1684000.00 | 2024-02-05   |\n| Total Cost                | 1684000.00 | 2024-02-05   |\n| Gross Profit              | 2272433.90 | 2024-02-05   |\n| Administrative Expenses    | 165230.64  | 2024-02-05   |\n| Selling Expenses          | 360961.15  | 2024-02-05   |\n| Depreciation             | 91503.27   | 2024-02-05   |\n| Financial Expenses        | 81394.22   | 2024-02-05   |\n| Total Expenses            | 699089.28  | 2024-02-05   |\n| Interest Income           | 15414.09   | 2024-02-05   |\n| Profit Before Tax         | 1588758.71 | 2024-02-05   |\n| Tax Expense               | 197821.72  | 2024-02-05   |\n| Net Profit                | 1390936.99 | 2024-02-05   |\n```\n\nNow let's extract the required values:\n\n1. **Main Business Revenue (Income from core operating activities)**: The amount for this line item is 3956433.90.\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold (Carrying amount of inventories sold)**: The amount for this line item is 1684000.00.\n\nNow we format the extracted values according to the structure specified in the instruction. \n\nHere's the JSON output with the required values:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3956433.90', 'value2': '1684000.00'}}\n```",
