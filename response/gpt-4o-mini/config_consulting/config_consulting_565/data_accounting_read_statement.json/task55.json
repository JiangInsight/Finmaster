This implies that the tax payable has increased by this amount during the reporting period.\n\n3. **Income Statement**:\n   - The income statement directly states a \"Tax Expense\" of **197821.72** for the period, indicating this is the total expected tax expense incurred during the reporting period.\n\nGiven all these pieces of information, the total tax amount that the entity is expected to pay (as indicated by the tax expense line in the income statement) is **197821.72**.\n\nTherefore, compiling the final answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '197821.72'} }\n```",
