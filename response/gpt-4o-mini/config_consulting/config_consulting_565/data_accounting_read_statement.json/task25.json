It includes all the costs directly associated with the manufacturing of products, which ties closely to the delivery of goods to customers.\n  \n2. **Selling Expenses** - These are costs associated with selling the products, such as sales commissions, advertising, and other expenses directly related to selling products to customers. This would also fall under the costs incurred to deliver goods and services to customers.\n\nNow, let's summarize these amounts:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: $1,684,000.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: $360,961.15\n\nNext, we combine these two amounts to calculate the total costs incurred for securing customer orders and delivering goods and services:\n\nTotal Cost = Cost of Goods Sold + Selling Expenses\nTotal Cost = $1,684,000.00 + $360,961.15 = $2,044,961.15\n\nBased on the task's instruction to extract specific values, we'll present the total selling cost incurred. \n\nPutting this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2044961.15'} }\n```",
