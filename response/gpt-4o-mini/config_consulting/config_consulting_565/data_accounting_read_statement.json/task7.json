The primary focus should be on items that directly relate to costs or expenses incurred by the company.\n\nUpon reviewing the data, we specifically note that the account of \"Accumulated Depreciation\" pertains to depreciation expenses. Depreciation is typically an expense reported in the profit and loss statement, so this account is what we'll extract information from.\n\nHere are the values from the table:\n- Initial amount for Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00\n- End amount for Accumulated Depreciation: 91503.27\n\nNow, we can construct the solution in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91503.27'} }\n```",
