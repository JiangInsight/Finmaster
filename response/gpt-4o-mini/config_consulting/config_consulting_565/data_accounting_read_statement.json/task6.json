Here, 'Fixed Assets' would relate to physical goods such as machinery, equipment, and property that are used in operations.\n\n2. **Look Through the Balance Sheet**:\n    - From the balance sheet provided:\n        - `Fixed Assets` has an initial value of `5000000.00` and an end value of `5000000.00`.\n        - `Accumulated Depreciation` which is against the Fixed Assets has an initial value of `0.00` and an end value of `91503.27`.\n      \n3. **Calculate the Net Value of Fixed Assets**:\n    - The net value of tangible assets that are utilized in operations is usually calculated as:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Net Fixed Assets} = \\text{Fixed Assets} - \\text{Accumulated Depreciation}\n      \\]\n   \n   For our case:\n   - Initial Net Fixed Assets Calculation:\n     - Initial Net Fixed Assets = `5000000.00` (Fixed Assets) - `0.00` (Accumulated Depreciation) = `5000000.00`\n   - End Net Fixed Assets Calculation:\n     - End Net Fixed Assets = `5000000.00` (Fixed Assets) - `91503.27` (Accumulated Depreciation) = `4908496.73`\n      \n4. **Extract Relevant Values**:\n    - Therefore, the initial and end values of the tangible assets held for productive use are:\n      - Initial Value: `5000000.00`\n      - End Value: `4908496.73`\n\nFollowing the above steps, the solution can be presented in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4908496.73'} }\n```",
