In this case, it shows an increase of **302000.00**.\n\nNo other line items in this section relate to amounts owed on credit. Therefore, we conclude that the relevant amount owed, which reflects the addition of liabilities due to credit purchases, is from \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\".\n\nNow let's format this into the required JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '302000.00'} }\n```",
