It directly reflects the carrying amount of inventories that were sold.\n3. **Total Cost**: This is generally the same as COGS but may reflect other costs in some contexts; here, it confirms that COGS was the total cost attributable to goods sold.\n4. The rest of the expenses (Administrative, Selling, Depreciation, Financial Expenses) do not pertain to the cost of inventories.\n5. **Gross Profit**: This shows the profit before accounting for other operating expenses.\n6. **Net Profit**: This captures the overall profit after accounting for all expenses, including taxes.\n\nThe line item we are concentrating on is \"Cost of Goods Sold\" with a recorded amount of **1684000.00**.\n\nBy identifying the Cost of Goods Sold, we can conclude that this is the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\nNow, let's format our answer as required.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1684000.00'} }\n```",
