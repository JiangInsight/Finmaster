Notably, it contains an \"Inventory\" line item that shows the inventory value at the end of the period. In this report, the Inventory at the end of the period is recorded as **0.00**.\n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: This details the cash inflows and outflows within the reporting period, highlighting changes in different asset accounts. The \"Increase Decrease in Inventory\" shows **-0.00**, indicating no change in inventory from the previous period.\n   - **Income Statement**: This outlines revenue and expenses during the period, stating \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) which reflects the costs related to the items that were sold. Here, this value is **1684000.00**.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Line Items**:\n   - To find the carrying amount of inventories sold, we refer to the COGS listed in the income statement. This value represents the cost associated with the inventory that has been sold during the reporting period.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The cost of goods sold **(COGS)** amount is **1684000.00**. This is the carrying amount of inventories that were sold during the reporting period.\n\nNow, we present our solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1684000.00'} }\n```",
