Let's break down the required line items one by one:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services (Cost of Goods Sold)**: \n   - The line item representing this cost is **\"Cost of Goods Sold\"**, which has an amount of **1684000.00**.\n\n2. **Depreciation (the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life)**:\n   - The line item representing depreciation is simply labeled **\"Depreciation\"**, with an amount of **91503.27**.\n\n3. **Financing costs incurred to raise funds needed for production and operation**:\n   - The line item that fits this description is **\"Financial Expenses\"**, which reports an amount of **81394.22**.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity expects to pay or recover during a reporting period (Tax Expense)**:\n   - This is represented by the line item **\"Tax Expense\"**, with an amount of **197821.72**.\n\nNow, let's compile this information into the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1684000.00', 'value2': '91503.27', 'value3': '81394.22', 'value4': '197821.72'} }\n```",
