                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to extract specific line items from the provided cash flow statement. The line items requested are:\n\n1. **Depreciation**: This represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale**: We need to find the relevant amount related to this.\n3. **Net cash flow from investing activities**: This refers to the net amount of cash generated from an entity’s acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents, as well as the receipt of interest and dividends.\n4. **Net increase in cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is typically represented as the net change in cash equivalents over the period.\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement to identify these figures:\n\n### Cash Flow From Operating Activities\n- Depreciation: **91503.27** (This is our value for Value1)\n  \n### Cash Flow from Investing Activities\n- Purchase of Fixed Assets: **0.00** (This indicates no cash was spent on new fixed assets)\n- Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: **-0.00** (This is our value for Value3)\n\n### Cash and Cash Equivalents\n- Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: **-1182491.05** (This is our value for Value4)\n\nThere was no specific mention of assets held for sale, as the cash flow statement does not provide a line item for that. However, zero amounts in inventories and assets might suggest there are minimal to no assets held for sale, which will be assumed as **0.00** for our case.\n\nNow we can compile the values:\n- value1 (Depreciation): 91503.27\n- value2 (Reduction in assets held for sale): We assume it to be 0.00 since it’s not explicitly defined in this context.\n- value3 (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities): -0.00\n- value4 (Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents): -1182491.05\n\nNow we’ll format the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91503.27', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-1182491.05'}}\n```",
