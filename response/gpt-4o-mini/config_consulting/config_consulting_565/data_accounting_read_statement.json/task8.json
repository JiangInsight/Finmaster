Prominent accounts representing such liabilities typically include \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\".\n\nHere's the process to extract this information:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Accounts**:\n   - **Accounts Payable**: This account indicates the amount owed for goods and services purchased on credit.\n   - **Taxes Payable**: This account represents the amount owed to taxing authorities.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and Final Values**:\n   - From the provided balance sheet:\n     - Accounts Payable: \n       - Initial_amount = 0.00 \n       - End_amount = 302000.00\n     - Taxes Payable: \n       - Initial_amount = 0.00 \n       - End_amount = 197821.72\n   \n   Thus, adding these amounts together provides the total liabilities stemming from goods and services purchased on credit.\n\n3. **Calculate Totals**:\n   - **Initial Value**: The sum of initial amounts owed (0.00 + 0.00) = 0.00\n   - **End Value**: The sum of end amounts owed (302000.00 + 197821.72) = 499821.72\n\n4. **Construct Result**:\n   - Now, putting these values into the required JSON format, we get:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '499821.72'} }\n```",
