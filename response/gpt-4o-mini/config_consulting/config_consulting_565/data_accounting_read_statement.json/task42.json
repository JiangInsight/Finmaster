Specifically, we are searching for entries that would indicate cash payments made for the acquisition of fixed assets.\n\nHere's the relevant section extracted for analysis:\n```\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nThe relevant line item is:\n- **\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\"** with an amount of **0.00**.\n\nSince this is the only line item listed under the investing activities related to the acquisition of PP&E and it shows a value of **0.00**, the conclusion follows.\n\nThus, the final solution is presented as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
