We are specifically looking for:\n\n1. **Interest Accrued but Not Yet Received**: This is typically found in the Balance Sheet under \"Interest Receivable\" and in the Income Statement under \"Interest Income\"\n2. **Net Addition in the Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents During the Period**: This is found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Net Increase\".\n\n### Step 1: Balance Sheet\nLooking at the Balance Sheet, we see the following relevant line item:\n- **Interest Receivable**: The ending amount is **15414.09**.\n\n### Step 2: Income Statement\nNext, we check the Income Statement:\n- **Interest Income**: The amount listed is **15414.09**. We confirm that this number is relevant to our interest accrual.\n\n### Step 3: Cash Flow Statement\nFinally, we analyze the Cash Flow Statement for the net addition in cash and cash equivalents:\n- **Net Increase** in Cash and Cash Equivalents is **-1182491.05**.\n\nNow, we compile the findings in order specified (Balance Sheet first, then Income Statement, then Cash Flow Statement).\n\n### Solution Format\nWe need to format our final solution in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '15414.09', 'value2': '-1182491.05'}}\n``` \n\nThis contains the correct values collected from the appropriate financial statements.",
