The total value of non-current assets is calculated after accounting for accumulated depreciation. \n\nHereâ€™s the breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the total non-current assets:\n   - Total Non-current Assets = Fixed Assets - Accumulated Depreciation\n   - Initial Total Non-current Assets = 5,000,000.00 (Initial Fixed Assets) - 0.00 (Initial Accumulated Depreciation) = 5,000,000.00\n   - End Total Non-current Assets = 5,000,000.00 (End Fixed Assets) - 91,503.27 (End Accumulated Depreciation) = 4,908,496.73\n\nHowever, to answer the specific task of extracting the line item for fixed assets as non-current assets:\n\n- The values for \"Fixed Assets\" directly are:\n  \n  - Initial Amount: 5,000,000.00 \n  - End Amount: 4,908,496.73 (after accounting for depreciation)\n\nNow we can present this in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '4908496.73'} }\n```",
