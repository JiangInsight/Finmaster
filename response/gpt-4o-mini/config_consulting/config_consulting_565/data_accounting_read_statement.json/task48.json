We are looking for two specific line items:\n\n1. Net Profit\n2. Purchase of Fixed Assets (which represents cash payments to acquire long-term assets).\n\nLet's break down the data:\n\n1. The cash flow statement identifies various accounts and their corresponding amounts. \n2. We will extract the values of \"Net Profit\" and \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Line Items from the Cash Flow Statement\n\n- The line item for \"Net Profit\" appears as follows:\n  - **Line item**: Net Profit\n  - **Amount**: 1390936.99\n\n- The line item for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is as follows:\n  - **Line item**: Purchase of Fixed Assets\n  - **Amount**: 0.00 (as indicated)\n\n### Step 2: Compile the Values\n\nBased on the extraction:\n- value1 corresponds to the **Net Profit** which is `1390936.99`.\n- value2 corresponds to the **Purchase of Fixed Assets** which is `0.00`.\n\n### Final Output \n\nTo present the answer in the required JSON format, we will write it as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1390936.99', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n``` \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1390936.99', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```",
