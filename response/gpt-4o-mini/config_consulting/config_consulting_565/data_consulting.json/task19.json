However, for practical purposes, we typically set the inventory turnover ratio to zero in case of zero inventory.\n\nThus the formula would return:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\text{undefined} \\text{ or } 0 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCompiling the results into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '19.99', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0'}}\n```",
