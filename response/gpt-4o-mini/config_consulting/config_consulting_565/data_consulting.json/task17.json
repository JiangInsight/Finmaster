                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: This value is directly from the cash flow statement.\n2. **Determine Total Debt**: This is calculated as the total current liabilities plus any long-term liabilities. In this case, there are no long-term liabilities mentioned, so we can simply take the total current liabilities.\n3. **Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio is given by dividing the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities by the Total Debt.\n\nNow let's break down each step using the provided financial statements.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1182491.05\n\n### Step 2: Determine Total Current Liabilities\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable\n- Accounts Payable = 302000.00\n- Taxes Payable = 197821.72\nSo,\n\\[\n\\text{Total Current Liabilities} = 302000.00 + 197821.72 = 499821.72\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n\\]\nSubstituting in the numbers we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-1182491.05}{499821.72} \\approx -2.37\n\\]\n\n### Final Result\nNow that we've calculated the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we present the answer in the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.37'} }\n```",
