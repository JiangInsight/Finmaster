                        "content": "To calculate the Cash to Current Debt Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Cash Available:**\n   - Cash available is typically the cash balance or cash equivalents at the end of the period. In our case, we can find cash from the cash flow statement:\n     - Ending Balance is provided as `6817508.95`.\n\n2. **Identify Current Liabilities:**\n   - Current debt refers to the current liabilities on the balance sheet. We will sum the relevant accounts indicating current liabilities:\n     - Accounts Payable: `302000.00`\n     - Taxes Payable: `197821.72`\n     - Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable\n     - Therefore, Total Current Liabilities = `302000.00 + 197821.72 = 499821.72`.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash to Current Debt Ratio:**\n   - The Cash to Current Debt Ratio can be calculated with the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash Available}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values we have:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} = \\frac{6817508.95}{499821.72}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Calculation:**\n   - Performing the calculation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cash to Current Debt Ratio} â‰ˆ 13.63\n     \\]\n\n5. **Format the Result:**\n   - We need to present the value as a string rounded to two decimal places.\n\nNow, let's present the formatted answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash to Current Debt Ratio': '13.63'}}\n```",
