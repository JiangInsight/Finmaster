Moreover, the payment/receipt status switches from \"Paid\" (indicating that the expense should be finalized) to \"Unpaid\".\n\nThus, the captured discrepancy can be detailed as such:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  'Original category': 'Administrative Expenses', \n  'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', \n  'Original date': '2024-01-30', \n  'Recorded date': '2024-01-30', \n  'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid', \n  'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', \n  'Original payment_method': 'Cash', \n  'Recorded payment_method': 'Cash', \n  'Original quantity': None, \n  'Recorded quantity': None, \n  'Original price': None, \n  'Recorded price': None, \n  'Original receive_method': None, \n  'Recorded receive_method': None, \n  'Original amount': '32705.96', \n  'Recorded amount': '37712.10', \n  'Original tax': None, \n  'Recorded tax': None, \n  'Original profit': None, \n  'Recorded profit': None, \n  'Original Preparer': None, \n  'Recorded Preparer': None, \n  'Original Approver': None, \n  'Recorded Approver': None, \n  'id': 'Expense20240130001'\n}}\n```\n\nThis structured breakdown clearly identifies the internal inconsistencies in the recorded transaction related to expenses, usable for future auditing and corrections.",
