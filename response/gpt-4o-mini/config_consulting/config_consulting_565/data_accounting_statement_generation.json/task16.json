The capital contribution remains unchanged unless any new capital or revised contributions are detailed within the transactions.\n   - Since there have been no additional capital contributions or deductions noted in the transactions provided, the end value of the paid-in capital will remain the same as the initial value.\n\n### Final Calculation:\n- **Initial Paid-in Capital:** 13,000,000.00\n- **End Paid-in Capital:** 13,000,000.00\n\n### Solution Format:\nWe will present our findings in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
