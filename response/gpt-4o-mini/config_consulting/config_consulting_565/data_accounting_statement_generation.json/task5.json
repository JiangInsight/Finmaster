                        "content": "To calculate the interest receivable for the provided transactions, we need to extract and sum the relevant transactions associated with interest receivables. Let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Transactions:**\n   - From the provided data, we need to identify transactions that have a type of \"Interest Receivables\".\n\n2. **Distinguish Initial and End Values:**\n   - The initial value for the interest receivables will be derived from transactions prior to the reporting date, which would be `2024-01-01`.\n   - The final value will be accumulated through all transactions up to the ending date `2024-02-05`.\n\n3. **Sum Up Interest Receivable Amounts:**\n   - For the initial value, we'll add up all \"Interest Receivables\" amounts recorded before `2024-01-01`.\n   - For the end value, we will sum up all \"Interest Receivables\" amounts recorded until `2024-02-05`, including all transactions marked after `2024-01-01`.\n\n4. **Calculate Values:**\n   - **Initial Interest Receivable:**\n     - There are no entries in the provided dataset prior to `2024-01-01` for interest receivables, so the initial value is `0.00`.\n   - **End Interest Receivable:**\n     - We calculate all entries for interest receivables up to `2024-02-05`:\n       - `Interest20240101001` = 445.0 (for `2024-01-01`)\n       - `Interest20240102002` = 445.0 (for `2024-01-02`)\n       - `Interest20240103003` = 445.0 (for `2024-01-03`)\n       - `Interest20240104004` = 444.911 (for `2024-01-04`)\n       - `Interest20240105005` = 444.911 (for `2024-01-05`)\n       - `Interest20240106006` = 444.911 (for `2024-01-06`)\n       - `Interest20240107007` = 444.822 (for `2024-01-07`)\n       - `Interest20240108008` = 442.152 (for `2024-01-08`)\n       - `Interest20240109009` = 442.152 (for `2024-01-09`)\n       - `Interest20240110010` = 442.152 (for `2024-01-10`)\n       - `Interest20240111011` = 442.152 (for `2024-01-11`)\n       - `Interest20240112012` = 442.152 (for `2024-01-12`)\n       - `Interest20240113013` = 424.085 (for `2024-01-13`)\n       - `Interest20240114014` = 424.085 (for `2024-01-14`)\n       - `Interest20240115015` = 424.085 (for `2024-01-15`)\n       - `Interest20240116016` = 422.30499999999995 (for `2024-01-16`)\n       - `Interest20240117017` = 421.41499999999996 (for `2024-01-17`)\n       - `Interest20240118018` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-18`)\n       - `Interest20240119019` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-19`)\n       - `Interest20240120020` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-20`)\n       - `Interest20240121021` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-21`)\n       - `Interest20240122022` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-22`)\n       - `Interest20240123023` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-23`)\n       - `Interest20240124024` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-24`)\n       - `Interest20240125025` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-25`)\n       - `Interest20240126026` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-26`)\n       - `Interest20240127027` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-27`)\n       - `Interest20240128028` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-28`)\n       - `Interest20240129029` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-29`)\n       - `Interest20240130030` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-30`)\n       - `Interest20240131031` = 419.635 (for `2024-01-31`)\n\nNow we sum these values to get the total interest receivable at the end.\n\n- Total interest receivable at the end = \n  445.0 + 445.0 + 445.0 + 444.911 + 444.911 + 444.911 + 444.822 + 442.152 + 442.152 + 442.152 + 442.152 \n  + 424.085 + 424.085 + 424.085 + 422.304 + 421.414 + 419.635 + 419.635 + 419.635 + 419.635 + 419.635 + \n  419.635 + 419.635 + 419.635 + 419.635 = 7553.17\n\nNow we put together the results in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Interest Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Interest Receivable End Value': '7553.17'} }\n```",
