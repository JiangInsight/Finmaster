Here, we choose the final recorded amount of 45751.600000000006 for the most recent entry from February 1, 2024.\n\n4. **Format the Output:**\n   With this value, we can present our output in the required JSON format.\n\nNow letâ€™s present the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '45751.60'}}\n``` \n\nIn summary, the final depreciation figure in the cash flow statement is 45751.60.",
