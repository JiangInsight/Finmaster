These transactions include new purchases and corrections to existing assets:\n\n1. **Purchases** of new Fixed Assets:\n   - **Purchase20231231001**: 2,000.0 (Purchase of Basic Consulting)\n   - **Purchase20231231002**: 1,000.0 (Purchase of Basic Consulting)\n   - **Purchase20231231004**: 1,000.0 (Purchase of Basic Consulting)\n   - **Purchase20231231008**: 60,000.0 (Paid for Premium Consulting)\n   - **Purchase20231231009**: 30,000.0 (Paid for Enterprise Solution)\n   - **Purchase20231231010**: 1,000.0 (Purchase of Basic Consulting)\n   - **Purchase20231231011**: 200,000.0 (Paid for Enterprise Solution)\n   - **Purchase20231231012**: 20,000.0 (Paid for Premium Consulting)\n   - **Purchase20231231013**: 10,000.0 (Paid for Standard Consulting)\n   - **Purchase20231231014**: 15,000.0 (Paid for Standard Consulting)\n   - **Purchase20231231015**: 20,000.0 (Paid for Premium Consulting)\n   - **Purchase20231231016**: 200,000.0 (Unpaid for Enterprise Solution)\n   - **Purchase20231231017**: 1,000.0 (Paid for Basic Consulting)\n   - **Purchase20231231018**: 200,000.0 (Paid for Enterprise Solution)\n   - **Purchase20231231019**: 300,000.0 (Paid for Enterprise Solution)\n   - **Purchase20231231020**: 40,000.0 (Unpaid for Account Payable)\n   \n   These purchases total:\n   - 2000 + 1000 + 1000 + 60000 + 30000 + 1000 + 200000 + 20000 + 10000 + 15000 + 20000 + 200000 + 1000 + 200000 + 300000 + 40000 = **TOTAL NEW PURCHASES = 1,093,000.0**\n\n2. **Depreciation**:\n   - **Depreciation recorded (Depreciation20240101001)**: **-45,751.67** was recorded for the year (negative impact on asset's book value).\n   - Another **Depreciation recorded (Depreciation20240201002)**: **-45,751.6** on the subsequent accounting period.\n\n   Therefore, total depreciation will be:\n   - **Total Depreciation**: (-45,751.67) + (-45,751.6) = **-91,503.27**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Non-current Assets End Value\nUsing the starting amount, we calculate the end value:\n1. Initial Value: **5,000,000.0** (Initial Non-current Assets)\n2. Add total purchases: + **1,093,000.0**\n3. Subtract total depreciation: - **91,503.27**\n\nThe formula:\n```\nTotal Non-current Assets End Value = Initial Value + Purchases - Depreciation\nTotal Non-current Assets End Value = 5,000,000.0 + 1,093,000.0 - 91,503.27\nTotal Non-current Assets End Value = 5,000,000.0 + 1,093,000.0 - 91,503.27\nTotal Non-current Assets End Value = 5,000,000.0 + 1,093,000.0 - 91,503.27 = **5,001,496.73**\n```\n\n### Final Output\nHereâ€™s the final representation of the calculated values in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '5014961.73'}}\n```",
