In this case, all purchases related to `Fixed Assets` will be analyzed.\n\n- Sum all transactions relevant to `Fixed Assets`, ignoring other expenditures.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Beginning and Ending Balances\n\n1. **Beginning Balance**: Initially provided as 8000000 (from the first deposit).\n2. **Ending Balance**: This will be calculated using beginning balance plus cash flows from the above sections (operations and investments).\n\n###  Final Calculation Results\n\nHere are the calculations filled in, with values derived:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    'Cash Flow From Operating Activities': '____',\n    'Net Profit': '-680699.26',\n    'Depreciation': '45751.67',\n    '(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-1000000.00',\n    '(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-13519.586',\n    '(Increase) Decrease in Inventory': '-120000.0',\n    'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '60000.00',\n    'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '13225.98',\n    'Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities': '-569499.87',\n    'Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-800000.00', \n    'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '800000.00',\n    'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-800000.00',\n    'Cash and Cash Equivalents': '434651.47',\n    'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00',\n    'Ending Balance': '434651.47',\n    'Net Increase': '-7565348.53'\n}}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Numerical Values:\n\n- **Net Profit** reflects total revenues less total expenses.\n- **Accounts Receivable** accounts for amounts still due from customer transactions.\n- **Accounts Payable** tracks amounts owed to suppliers, affecting cash movements.\n- The total cash flowing from operating activities represents cash outflows, less any inflows.\n\nThis comprehensive review arrives at a completed cash flow statement that adheres to the provided transactions and calculates net profit while addressing all changes within key financial components.",
