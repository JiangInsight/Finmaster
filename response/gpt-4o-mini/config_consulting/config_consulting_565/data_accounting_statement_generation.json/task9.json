We will also take into account any new purchases of fixed assets, if applicable.\n\n### Steps to Calculate Fixed Assets Net:\n\n1. **Initial Fixed Assets Value**:\n   - From the initial transactions, we have:\n     - Initial fixed assets amount recorded: **5000000.0** \n\n2. **New Purchases of Fixed Assets**:\n   - Looking at the transactions after the initial entry:\n     - The record of purchase amounting to **2000.0** is listed as an asset in a transaction type calling for a fixed asset.\n     - The record of purchase amounting to **1000.0** is similarly accounted as another asset purchase after the initial entry.\n     - We will assume these amounts are also added to the fixed assets.\n\n3. **Total Purchase Amount for Fixed Assets**:\n   - Fixed Assets Purchased:\n     - **2000.0 (from the first purchase entry)**\n     - **1000.0 (from the second purchase entry)**\n     - Therefore, total additional assets purchased: **2000.0 + 1000.0 = 3000.0** \n\n4. **Total Fixed Assets Before Depreciation**:\n   - Initial Value of fixed assets + New Purchases:\n     - **5000000.0 + 3000.0 = 5003000.0**\n\n5. **Depreciation**:\n   - Total depreciation recorded in the transaction:\n     - **45751.67** for the first month and **45751.6** for the second month.\n   - Total depreciation = **45751.67 + 45751.6 = 91503.27**\n\n6. **Final Fixed Assets Net Value**:\n   - After accounting for depreciation:\n     - Final Fixed Assets Net = Total Fixed Assets – Total Depreciation\n     - = **5003000.0 – 91503.27 = 4911496.73**\n\n### Result Presentation:\n\nUsing the above calculations, we can summarize the values for the JSON output format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'fixed assets net Initial Value': '5000000.00', 'fixed assets net End Value': '4911496.73'} }\n``` \n\nThis covers both the initial asset valuation and the final asset valuation after accounting for new purchases and depreciation.",
