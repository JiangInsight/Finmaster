                        "content": "To solve the problem, we will calculate two financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n1. **Total Assets**: From the balance sheet, the total assets at the end date (2024-02-05) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Assets} = 14799664.61\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Liabilities**: To find the total liabilities, we need to consider the total current liabilities (which includes accounts payable and taxes payable). From the balance sheet:\n   - Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 462000.00 + 169880.98 = \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Current Liabilities} = 631880.98\n   \\]\n   \n   Since there are no other liabilities listed, we can assume Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Liabilities} = 631880.98\n   \\]\n\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio**: This ratio is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{631880.98}{14799664.61} \\approx 0.0427\n   \\]\n   Converting it to proper format (keeping up to 2 decimal places):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = 0.04\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow**: From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} = -1368775.90\n   \\]\n   For the purpose of the ratio, we will use the absolute value:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow} = 1368775.90\n   \\]\n\n2. **Net Income**: From the income statement, the net profit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Profit} = 1167783.63\n   \\]\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**: This ratio is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Net Profit}} = \\frac{1368775.90}{1167783.63} \\approx 1.17\n   \\]\n   Converting it to proper format (keeping up to 2 decimal places):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} \\approx 1.17\n   \\]\n\n### Finalizing the Answers\n\nNow we can present the solution in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.04', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '1.17'} }\n```",
