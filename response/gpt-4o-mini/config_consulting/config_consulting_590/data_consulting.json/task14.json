                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Formula**: \n   The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio measures how effectively a company collects its receivables. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Net Credit Sales**: \n   In the provided data, we will use the Total Revenue from the Income Statement as our Net Credit Sales since the problem doesn't specify that we need a breakdown of credit versus cash sales. Therefore:\n   - **Net Credit Sales = Total Revenue = 3,397,619.40**\n\n3. **Average Accounts Receivable**: \n   To calculate the average accounts receivable, we need the accounts receivable amounts at the beginning and the end of the period.\n   - **Beginning Accounts Receivable = 0.00** (as per the balance sheet)\n   - **Ending Accounts Receivable = 2,902,136.39** (as per the balance sheet)\n\n   The average accounts receivable can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable}}{2}\n   \\]\n   - **Average Accounts Receivable = \\frac{0 + 2,902,136.39}{2} = 1,451,068.195**\n\n4. **Calculate the Ratio**: \n   Now that we have both the Net Credit Sales and the Average Accounts Receivable, we can plug these values into the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{3,397,619.40}{1,451,068.195} \\approx 2.34\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Result Formatting**: \n   The result is approximately 2.34. We need to present our result in the specified JSON format. \n\nHere it is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.34'} }\n```",
