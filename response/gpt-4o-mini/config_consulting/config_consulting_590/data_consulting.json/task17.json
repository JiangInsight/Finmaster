                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need to determine the cash flow from operating activities and total debt. The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}} \\]\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nFrom the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is provided as:\n\\[ \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} = -1368775.90 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Liabilities\nTo find total liabilities, we need to analyze the balance sheet. The only liabilities provided in the balance sheet are the current liabilities:\n\n- Accounts Payable: 462000.00\n- Taxes Payable: 169880.98\n- Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 462000.00 + 169880.98 = 631880.98\n\nTotal liabilities here only include current liabilities as no long-term liabilities are mentioned.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nNow we can substitute the values into our formula:\n\n1. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -1368775.90\n2. **Total Liabilities**: 631880.98\n\nSo, the calculation is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-1368775.90}{631880.98} \\approx -2.17\n\\]\n\n### Final Result\nThe calculated Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately -2.17.\n\nNow, present the final result in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.17'}}\n```",
