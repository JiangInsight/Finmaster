                        "content": "To calculate the paid-in capital, we'll first gather all the relevant entries pertaining to paid-in capital from the provided transactions. We will sum the amounts related to cash deposits, bank deposits, and fixed asset purchases, as these would typically contribute to a company's paid-in capital. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify and sum the initial amounts\n\nFrom the transactions, we can see the following entries contributing to the initial paid-in capital:\n\n1. **Cash Deposit**\n   - Amount: 3,000,000.00\n2. **Bank Deposit**\n   - Amount: 5,000,000.00\n3. **Fixed Assets**\n   - Amount: 5,000,000.00\n\nLet's calculate the total initial paid-in capital:\n\nInitial Paid-in Capital = \n- Cash Deposit + Bank Deposit + Fixed Assets\n\n- Initial Paid-in Capital = \n  \\(3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 13,000,000.00\\)\n\n### Step 2: Identify any additional transactions affecting the paid-in capital\n\nAfter the initial entries, we need to check if there are any transactions that might affect the paid-in capital. In this case, the provided transactions list does not include other contributions or equity changes that could alter the paid-in capital after the initial values. Therefore, we assume that after the initial deposits, the paid-in capital remains the same.\n\n### Step 3: Summarize initial and final values\n\n- **Paid-in Capital Initial Value**: \\(13,000,000.00\\)\n- **Paid-in Capital End Value**: Since there are no further changes, it remains \\(13,000,000.00\\).\n\n### Final Output\n\nNow we format the answer in the required JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
