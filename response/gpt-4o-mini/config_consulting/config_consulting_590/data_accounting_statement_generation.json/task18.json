Owner's equity changes due to:\n- Revenues from sales (which increase equity)\n- Expenses (which decrease equity)\n\n### Step 3: Sum Revenues\nFor the sales transactions:\n- Sale on 2024-01-02: 284,230.98\n- Sale on 2024-01-02: 274,894.93\n- Sale on 2024-01-03: 287,021.71\n- Sale on 2024-01-06: 180,661.23\n- Sale on 2024-01-08: 285,922.71\n- Sale on 2024-01-10: 295,859.81\n- Sale on 2024-01-11: 193,204.06\n- Sale on 2024-01-12: 13,759.13\n- Sale on 2024-01-30: 216,405.22\n- Sale on 2024-01-31: 241,168.27\n\n**Total Sales Revenue**:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Revenue} = 284,230.98 + 274,894.93 + 287,021.71 + 180,661.23 + 285,922.71 + 295,859.81 + 193,204.06 + 13,759.13 + 216,405.22 + 241,168.27 = 2,615,390.76\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Sum Expenses\nFor the expense transactions:\n- Administrative Expenses: 7,069.68 + 13,381.35 + 18,522.55 + 18,305.95 + 11,861.78 + 12,925.57 + 8,666.24 + 17,013.85 + 8,600.05 + 9,840.4 + 10,538.58 + 17,959.24 + 11,989.77 + 19,421.61 + 8,398.64 = 239,225.51\n\n**Total Expenses**:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Expenses} = 7,069.68 + 13,381.35 + 18,522.55 + 18,305.95 + 11,861.78 + 12,925.57 + 8,666.24 + 17,013.85 + 8,600.05 + 9,840.4 + 10,538.58 + 17,959.24 + 11,989.77 + 19,421.61 + 8,398.64 = 239,225.51\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Final Owner's Equity\nThe final ownerâ€™s equity is calculated by taking the initial owner's equity, adding the total revenue, and subtracting the total expenses.\n\\[\n\\text{Final Owner's Equity} = \\text{Initial Owner's Equity} + \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Expenses}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Final Owner's Equity} = 13,000,000 + 2,615,390.76 - 239,225.51 = 15,376,165.25\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Format the Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '15376165.25'}}\n```",
