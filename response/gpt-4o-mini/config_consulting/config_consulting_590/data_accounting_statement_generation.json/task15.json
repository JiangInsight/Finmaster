Here, we only have records related to purchases. \n- Purchases with \"Unpaid\" status will be liabilities as they denote amounts that need to be paid.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Initial Total Liabilities\n- Analyzing the initial entries, we have:\n  - Purchase 1: 300000.0 (Unpaid)\n  - Purchase 2: 5000.0 (Unpaid)\n  - Purchase 3: 200000.0 (Unpaid)\n  - Purchase 4: 10000.0 (Unpaid)\n\n### Total Initial Liabilities Calculation\nTotal Initial Liabilities = 300000.0 + 5000.0 + 200000.0 + 10000.0 = **515000.0**\n\n### Step 3: Identify Final Liabilities\n- Next, we analyze the final entries for the liabilities as well. The pertinent entries are still purchases that are categorized as \"Unpaid.\" \n\nCalculating these totals:\n- Purchase 1: 100000.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase 2: 5000.0 (Unpaid)\n- Purchase 3: 20000.0 (Unpaid)\n\n### Total Final Liabilities Calculation\nTotal Final Liabilities = 100000.0 + 5000.0 + 20000.0 = **125000.0**\n\n### Result Formatting\nNow we will compile our findings into the requested JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '515000.0', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '125000.0'} }\n```",
