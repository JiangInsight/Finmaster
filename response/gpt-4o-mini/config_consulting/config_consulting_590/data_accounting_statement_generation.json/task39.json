                        "content": "To calculate the change in interest receivable for the provided transactions, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify All Interest Receivable Transactions**: We'll look for all entries related to \"Interest Receivables\" to determine their amounts.\n\n2. **Sum Up the Changes**: We'll sum up the \"amount\" for each \"Interest Receivables\" entry. We need to distinguish between amounts that increase (new interest earned) and amounts that decrease (previous interest being settled).\n\n3. **Calculate the Final Amount**: Finally, we'll determine the net effect on interest receivable by subtracting any decreases from the total increases.\n\n### Let's proceed with the calculations:\n\n#### 1. List of Interest Receivable Transactions\n\nFrom the provided transactions, the relevant interest receivable entries are:\n\n- **2024-01-01**: 418.30 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-02**: 418.30 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-03**: 418.30 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-04**: 418.12 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-05**: 418.12 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-06**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-07**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-08**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-09**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-10**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-11**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-12**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-13**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-14**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-15**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-16**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-17**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-18**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-19**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-20**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-21**: 418.03 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-22**: 417.77 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-23**: 417.77 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-24**: 417.77 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-25**: 417.77 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-26**: 417.77 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-27**: 417.77 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-28**: 417.77 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-29**: 399.97 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-30**: 399.97 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-01-31**: 382.17 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-02-01**: 382.17 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-02-02**: 382.17 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-02-03**: 381.99 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-02-04**: 381.99 (Unpaid)\n- **2024-02-05**: 381.99 (Unpaid)\n\nAll amounts are unpaid, so they effectively accumulate.\n\n#### 2. Sum of Interest Receivable\n\nNow, let's sum these amounts:\n\n- For dates where the amount is 418.30, it occurs 3 times:\n  - \\(3 \\times 418.30 = 1254.90 \\)\n\n- For dates where the amount is 418.12, it occurs 2 times:\n  - \\(2 \\times 418.12 = 836.24 \\)\n\n- For dates where the amount is 418.03, it occurs 12 times:\n  - \\(12 \\times 418.03 = 5016.36 \\)\n\n- For dates where the amount is 417.77, it occurs 4 times:\n  - \\(4 \\times 417.77 = 1671.08 \\)\n\n- For dating where the amount is 399.97:\n  - \\(1 \\times 399.97 = 399.97 \\)\n\n- For dates where the amount is 382.17, it occurs 3 times:\n  - \\(3 \\times 382.17 = 1146.51 \\)\n\n- For dates where the amount is 381.99, it occurs 2 times:\n  - \\(2 \\times 381.99 = 763.98 \\)\n\nThe total increases are:\n\n\\[ \n1254.90 + 836.24 + 5016.36 + 1671.08 + 399.97 + 1146.51 + 763.98 = 10498.04 \n\\]\n\n*Note: All are unpaid, so they don't decrease total.*\n\n#### 3. Changes In Interest Receivable\n\nThe difference overall is based on those entries and their total would equate to what's \"lost\" or ongoing number for receivable.\n\nFinally, via a detailed audit, let's collate the total received per \"interest receivable\" against previous totals deducing any settled or charge offs. Since all entries are unpaid, we view that the final accumulated remains.\n\n### Final Step: Construct the JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '10498.04'} }\n``` \n\nThis indicates the net change of receivables has increased based on accumulated entries and all remain as stated.",
