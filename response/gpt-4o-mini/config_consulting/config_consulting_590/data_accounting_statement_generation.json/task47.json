Hereâ€™s how:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Cash Inflows and Outflows\nWe will classify each transaction into cash inflows (deposits, sales) and cash outflows (expenses, purchases). \n\n1. **Cash Inflows**:\n   - Cash deposits\n   - Sales\n\n2. **Cash Outflows**:\n   - Operating expenses\n   - Purchases\n   - Fixed Asset purchases (if relevant)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Cash Inflows\nFrom the transactions:\n\n| Type                     | Amount       |\n|--------------------------|--------------|\n| Cash deposit             | 3,000,000.00 |\n| Bank deposit             | 5,000,000.00 |\n| Sale (Total from listed) | 1,321,048.68 | (Calculated by summing up all recorded sales amounts)\n\n**Total Cash Inflows = Cash deposits + Bank deposits + Total Sales =**\n   \n   \\(3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 1,321,048.68 = 9,321,048.68\\)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Cash Outflows\nFrom the transactions:\n\n| Type                          | Amount          |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Purchase (Total from listed)  | 3,953,000.00    | (Sum of all payments made for purchases)\n| Administrative Expenses (Sum) | 111,205.38      | (Total from administrative expenses)\n| Sales Expenses (Total)        | 70,903.95       | (Total from sales expenses)\n| Financial Expenses (Total)    | 63,177.46       | (Total from financial expenses)\n| Other Expenses (Total)        | 70,303.71       | (Any unidentified expenses that are part of cash outflows)\n\n**Total Cash Outflows = Total Purchases + Administrative Expenses + Sales Expenses + Financial Expenses + Other Expenses =**\n\n   \\(3,953,000 + 111,205.38 + 70,903.95 + 63,177.46 + 70,303.71 = 4,268,590.50\\)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Ending Cash Balance\nInitial Cash + Total Cash Inflows - Total Cash Outflows:\n\n**Ending Cash Balance = Initial Cash + Cash Inflows - Cash Outflows =**\n\nInitial Cash Balance was not specified; let's assume an initial cash balance of **0.00** for the sake of this calculation.\n\n   \\(0 + 9,321,048.68 - 4,268,590.50 = 5,052,458.18\\)\n\nNow, we present the result rounded to two decimal points as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Ending Balance': '5052458.18'}}\n```",
