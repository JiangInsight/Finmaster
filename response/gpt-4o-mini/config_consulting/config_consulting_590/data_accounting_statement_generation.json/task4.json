Since the problem starts from 2023-12-31, that means initial accounts receivable is 0.\n\n3. **Calculate Final Accounts Receivable**: We will sum up all amounts from sales where the payment status is \"Unpaid\", meaning people owe money for those sales.\n\n### Initial Accounts Receivable Calculation\nFor the given problem, the initial accounts receivable value is understood to be 0 because we are starting from no outstanding receivables.\n\n### Final Accounts Receivable Calculation\nWe will examine the list for all sales that are \"Unpaid\":\n\n- `Sale on 2024-01-02`: 284230.98 (Account Receivable)\n- `Sale on 2024-01-02`: 274894.93 (Account Receivable)\n- `Sale on 2024-01-03`: 287021.71 (Account Receivable)\n- `Sale on 2024-01-06`: 180661.23 (Account Receivable)\n- `Sale on 2024-01-07`: 2041.74 (Account Receivable)\n- `Sale on 2024-01-10`: 1925.47 (Account Receivable)\n- `Sale on 2024-01-10`: 295859.81 (Account Receivable)\n- `Sale on 2024-01-12`: 13759.13 (Account Receivable)\n- `Sale on 2024-01-13`: 2212.39 (Account Receivable)\n- `Sale on 2024-01-13`: 277286.94 (Account Receivable)\n- `Sale on 2024-01-30`: 216405.22 (Account Receivable)\n- `Sale on 2024-01-30`: 272245.21 (Account Receivable)\n- `Sale on 2024-01-30`: 2313.08 (Account Receivable)\n\nNow summing these values together:\n\nAccounts Receivable = \n284230.98 + \n274894.93 + \n287021.71 + \n180661.23 + \n2041.74 + \n1925.47 + \n295859.81 + \n13759.13 + \n2212.39 + \n277286.94 + \n216405.22 + \n272245.21 + \n2313.08\n\n### Calculation:\n- 284230.98\n- 274894.93\n- 287021.71\n- 180661.23\n- 2041.74\n- 1925.47\n- 295859.81\n- 13759.13\n- 2212.39\n- 277286.94\n- 216405.22\n- 272245.21\n- 2313.08\n\nCalculating this total gives us:\n- Total Accounts Receivable = 2425132.40\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Receivable End Value': '2425132.40'}}\n``` \n\nThis represents the final value of accounts receivable after all unpaid sales are taken into account.",
