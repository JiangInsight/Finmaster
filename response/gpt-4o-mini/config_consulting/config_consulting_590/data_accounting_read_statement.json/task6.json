The extracted values for tangible items held for the use in production/supply are:\n- **Initial Fixed Assets Value**: 5,000,000.00\n- **End Fixed Assets Value**: 5,000,000.00 \n\nThe final output JSON will be derived from these values:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5000000.00'}}\n```",
