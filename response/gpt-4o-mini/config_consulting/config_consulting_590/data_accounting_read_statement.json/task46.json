Let's analyze the provided inputs step by step:\n\n1. **Identifying Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - The relevant section is labeled \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n   - The only line item mentioned here is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of 0.00.\n   - The net cash flow from investing activities is -0.00.\n\n2. **Decomposing Into Sub-Items**:\n   - The only available sub-item in the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" which is 0.00.\n   - As there are no other line items related to acquisition or disposal of long-term assets and investments mentioned, this is the only sub-item we have.\n\n3. **Net Amount**:\n   - The net cash flow from investing activities is -0.00, which indicates that while there may be some cash outflows, they are not recorded here. Therefore, this figure stands for the overall cash flow from investing activities.\n\n4. **Final Output Construction**:\n   - The net cash flow from the above analysis is -0.00.\n   - The value of the only component sub-item is 0.00.\n\nNow we format the result according to the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'} }\n```",
