The two specific items we are looking for are:\n\n1. Interest accrued but not yet received\n2. Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\n\nWe will group the extracted items by financial statement type, maintaining the required order:\n\n### Step 1: Balance Sheet\nIn the Balance Sheet, we look for \"Interest Receivable\" which indicates the interest accrued but not yet received.\n\n- Interest Receivable: **14796.43**\n\nThere is no line item in the Balance Sheet related to cash and cash equivalents net addition, so we move to the next financial statement.\n\n### Step 2: Income Statement\nIn the Income Statement, we look for \"Interest Income,\" which also confirms the same amount but does not affect our selection for interest accrued.\n\n- Interest Income: **14796.43** (This confirms our previous finding)\n\nNo necessary additional information on cash equivalents net change.\n\n### Step 3: Cash Flow Statement\nIn this statement, we must find the \"Net Increase\" of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n- Net Increase: **-1368775.90**\n\nThis negative value indicates a decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n### Conclusion\nNow that we have extracted the relevant line items, we can structure the solution accordingly.\n\n- Value1 (Interest accrued but not yet received): **14796.43**\n- Value2 (Net addition in cash and cash equivalents): **-1368775.90**\n\nNow, formatting these findings into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14796.43', 'value2': '-1368775.90'} }\n```",
