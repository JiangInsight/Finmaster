Depreciation is typically included under operating activities as it affects the net profit.\n\n2. **Locating the Depreciation Line Item**: From the provided data, I will scan for the \"Depreciation\" line item:\n   - The relevant portion of the cash flow statement is:\n     ```\n     | Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n     | Net Profit  | 1167783.63 | 2024-02-05 |\n     | Depreciation  | 91492.31 | 2024-02-05 |\n     ```\n\n3. **Identifying the Value**: The value associated with the \"Depreciation\" line item is `91492.31`.\n\n4. **Formatting the Answer**: Now that we've extracted the value, we format it in the required JSON structure.\n\nThe final answer is thus:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91492.31'} }\n```",
