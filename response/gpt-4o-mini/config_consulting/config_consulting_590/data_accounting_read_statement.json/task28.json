The key accounts we are interested in are those related to tax.\n\n2. **Identify Tax-Related Account:** \n   In the provided income statement, the relevant line item we are looking for is the \"Tax Expense.\" \n\n3. **Extract the Value from the Statement:**\n   Upon reviewing the entries, we find:\n   - Tax Expense: 169880.98\n\n4. **Format the Solution:**\n   We will format the solution in the specified JSON structure.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer we derive is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '169880.98'} }\n```",
