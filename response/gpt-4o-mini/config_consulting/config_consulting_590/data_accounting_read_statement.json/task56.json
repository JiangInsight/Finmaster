The value here is **91492.31**.\n   \n2. **Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - In the cash flow statement, there is a line item 'Depreciation' which usually reflects the depreciation expense for the period. The value here is also **91492.31**.\n\n3. **Income Statement**: \n   - The income statement again has a line showing 'Depreciation' which indicates the expense incurred for depreciation in that specific period. The value listed here is again **91492.31**.\n\nSince all sections agree on the same value for depreciation over this period, it's safe to conclude that the value representing the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is consistent at **91492.31**.\n\nNow, I'll present the final solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91492.31'} }\n```",
