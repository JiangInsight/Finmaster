We look for the \"Inventory\" line item in the balance sheet.\n2. The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Inventory\" is 0.00.\n3. The \"End_amount\" for \"Inventory\" is 343000.00.\n\nUsing this information, we can summarize as follows:\n\n- Initial Value: 0.00 (value at the beginning of the period)\n- End Value: 343000.00 (value at the end of the period)\n\nThus, the extracted values are:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '343000.00'}}\n```",
