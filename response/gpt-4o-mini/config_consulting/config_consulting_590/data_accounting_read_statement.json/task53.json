Here, it is stated as:\n     - Inventory at end date: **343000.00** (as of 2024-02-05).\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement Examination**:\n   - The cash flow statement contains an entry that indicates the changes in inventory. The entry is:\n     - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: **-343000.00** (indicating a decrease in inventory during the period).\n\n3. **Income Statement Examination**:\n   - The income statement lists the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), which reflects the direct costs attributable to the goods sold during the period:\n     - Cost of Goods Sold: **1337000.00** (as of 2024-02-05).\n   - This amount represents the carrying amount of the inventories that were sold during the reporting period.\n\nBased on this analysis, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period corresponds to the Cost of Goods Sold listed in the income statement.\n\nFinal extraction will look like this:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1337000.00'} }\n```",
