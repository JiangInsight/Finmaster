The relevant section is as follows:\n\n```\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 6631224.10 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -1368775.90 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\n3. **Identify the Beginning Balance**: Under the cash and cash equivalents section, the 'Beginning Balance' is labeled specifically, and the value indicated is `8000000.00`.\n\n4. **Extract the Value**: The value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is `8000000.00`.\n\nNow, we can format our response accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
