This line represents interest that has been accrued but not yet received.\n   \n2. **Extracting Values**:\n   - On the balance sheet for the entry `Interest Receivable`:\n     - **Initial Amount (as of 2023-12-31)**: 0.00\n     - **End Amount (as of 2024-02-05)**: 14796.43\n   - This shows that the interest receivable increased from 0.00 to 14796.43 over the period.\n\n3. **Double-Checking Cash Flow and Income Statement**:\n   - From the cash flow statement:\n     - The entry `(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable` shows -14796.43.\n     - This confirms that the amount of interest receivable reported on the balance sheet has indeed changed by this amount.\n   - From the income statement:\n     - The `Interest Income` line shows 14796.43, indicating that this is the interest income recognized during this period.\n\n4. **Final Values**:\n   - The initial value of interest accrued (not received) started at 0.00.\n   - The end value is 14796.43 as reported on the balance sheet.\n\n5. **Compiling the Result**:\n   - We will structure the outcome in the required JSON format.\n\nCombining all findings, the final solution is represented as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '14796.43'}}\n```",
