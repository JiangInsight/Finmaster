Typically, the relevant line item that reflects the cost associated with goods sold, which includes inventories, is labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nLet's analyze the provided financial data step by step:\n\n1. **Income Statement Analysis**:\n   - The income statement consists of several line items including revenue, expenses, and profit.\n   - We specifically look for any references to \"selling\", \"cost\", or direct mentions of \"inventories\".\n\n2. **Identifying the Key Line Item**:\n   - The most relevant line item here is:\n     - **Cost of Goods Sold**: The entry states `1337000.00`. \n\n3. **Interpreting the Value**:\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n   - This is the figure we're interested in, as it reflects the cost associated with the goods that were sold.\n\n4. **Constructing the Solution**:\n   - With the identified amount for Cost of Goods Sold being `1337000.00`, we will format the answer according to the specified JSON structure.\n\nNow, we compile our findings into the solution format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1337000.00'} }\n```",
