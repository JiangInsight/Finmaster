A decrease in accounts receivable indicates that the company has collected more cash from customers than the credit sales made during the period.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Line Items**: In the provided cash flow statement, the relevant line is:\n   - **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**: The given value is `-2902136.39`. \n\n3. **Interpreting the Value**:   \n   - Here, a negative sign before the amount indicates a decrease in accounts receivable. Thus, this amount reflects cash collected, and the value `-2902136.39` confirms it is indeed a decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n\n4. **Formatting the Answer**: According to the specified output format, I'll place this value in the required JSON structure.\n\nNow, summarizing the findings in the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2902136.39'} }\n```",
