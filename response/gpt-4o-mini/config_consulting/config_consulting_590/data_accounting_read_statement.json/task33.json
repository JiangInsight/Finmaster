                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to identify two specific line items from the given income statement:\n\n1. **The amount of income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities**: This is represented by the \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\". Both line items typically represent the total revenue generated from the core operations of the business.\n\n2. **The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nNow, let's look at the provided income statement:\n\n```\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Main Business Revenue | 3397619.40 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue | 3397619.40 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 1337000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost | 1337000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit | 2060619.40 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses | 271886.07 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Selling Expenses | 319828.12 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation | 91492.31 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses | 54544.72 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses | 737751.22 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income | 14796.43 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax | 1337664.61 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense | 169880.98 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit | 1167783.63 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nNow we extract the relevant values:\n\n- For the income from core operating activities, the \"Main Business Revenue\" is **3397619.40**.\n- For the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is **1337000.00**.\n\nPutting these values into the required JSON format, we get:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3397619.40', 'value2': '1337000.00'} }\n``` \n\nThis indicates the amount of revenue generated from the core activities and the cost associated with the inventories sold during the period.",
