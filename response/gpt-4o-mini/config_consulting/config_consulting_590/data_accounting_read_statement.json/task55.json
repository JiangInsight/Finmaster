This represents the taxes that the entity owes.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**: The cash flow statement also reflects the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" of 169880.98, which aligns with the taxes expected to be paid.\n\n3. **Income Statement**: The income statement explicitly lists a \"Tax Expense\" of 169880.98. This figure indicates the amount of tax expense recognized for the period and corresponds to what is reported in the balance sheet and cash flow statement.\n\nAll three statements support that the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay is 169880.98.\n\nTherefore, we can present the solution as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '169880.98'} }\n```",
