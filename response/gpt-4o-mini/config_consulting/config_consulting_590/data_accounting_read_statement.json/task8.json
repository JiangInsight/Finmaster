The relevant line items that indicate amounts owed are:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**\n2. **Taxes Payable**\n3. **Total Current Liabilities**\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Initial and Final Values\n\n**1. Accounts Payable**\n- **Initial Amount**: 0.00\n- **End Amount**: 462000.00\n\n**2. Taxes Payable**\n- **Initial Amount**: 0.00\n- **End Amount**: 169880.98\n\n**3. Total Current Liabilities**\nThis includes the total of both accounts payable and taxes payable.\n- **Initial Amount**: 0.00\n- **End Amount**: 631880.98\n\n### Step 2: Consolidating Information\n\nHowever, for the purpose of extracting the amounts owed for credit purchases, we will refer primarily to Accounts Payable, which is the main line item representing amounts owed for goods and services. \n\nThe initial and final values we will use are from **Accounts Payable**:\n- **Initial Value**: 0.00\n- **End Value**: 462000.00\n\n### Final JSON Format\n\nNow we present our findings in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '462000.00'} }\n```",
