We are looking for the following line items:\n\n1. Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit.\n2. Financing costs incurred by the enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operations.\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment, and other long-term assets.\n\nLet's analyze each financial statement step by step:\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet:\nThe relevant line items in the balance sheet are:\n- **Accounts Receivable**: This represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit. \n- The amounts owed to the entity in the end value column is `2902136.39`.\n\n### 2. Income Statement:\nIn the income statement, we need to identify financing costs:\n- **Financial Expenses**: This line item represents the financing costs incurred by the enterprise. The end value here is `54544.72`.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement:\nFinally, in the cash flow statement, we look for cash payments related to property, plant, and equipment:\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This line item indicates cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment. The amount listed is `0.00`, meaning no cash payment was made for fixed assets during this period.\n\n### Summary of Extracted Values\n- From the **Balance Sheet**, we have:\n  - Accounts Receivable → **value1**: `2902136.39`\n  \n- From the **Income Statement**, we denote:\n  - Financial Expenses → **value2**: `54544.72`\n\n- From the **Cash Flow Statement**, we identify:\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets → **value3**: `0.00` \n\nNow, we compile these values into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2902136.39', 'value2': '54544.72', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```",
