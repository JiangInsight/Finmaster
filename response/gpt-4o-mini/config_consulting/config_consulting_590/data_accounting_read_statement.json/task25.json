Review the income statement for relevant line items:\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold**: This is typically the primary cost incurred in delivering goods to customers. It includes all direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold.\n   - **Selling Expenses**: These expenses are associated with the selling of goods or services, including costs incurred to secure customer orders (e.g., sales commissions, advertising).\n\n2. Extract the relevant amounts from the statement:\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: **1,337,000.00**\n   - Selling Expenses: **319,828.12**\n\n3. Sum these costs to find the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services:\n   - Total Costs = Cost of Goods Sold + Selling Expenses\n   - Total Costs = 1,337,000.00 + 319,828.12 = 1,656,828.12\n\n4. Prepare the final output in the specified JSON format. The value specified is the total cost incurred.\n\nThus, the solution would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1656828.12'} }\n```",
