The value indicated is **1143833.89**. \n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The cash flow statement also shows \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable,\" which is also **1143833.89**. This confirms that the amount reflected in the balance sheet corresponds with the cash flow indicating a liability.\n\n3. **Income Statement**:\n   - The income statement shows \"Tax Expense,\" which is another way the tax obligation is recorded and it also amounts to **1143833.89**. This is the amount recognized as an expense for the period, matching the taxes payable line item in the balance sheet.\n\nIn all three financial statements, the value of the tax indicates **1143833.89** as the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period.\n\nBased on this information, the extracted tax value is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1143833.89'} }\n```",
