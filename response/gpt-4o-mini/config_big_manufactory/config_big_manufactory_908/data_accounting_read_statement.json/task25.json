These costs typically include:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company, which is essential for delivering goods to customers.\n2. **Selling Expenses**: This includes costs associated with securing customer orders, such as marketing, sales commissions, and advertising.\n\nFrom the income statement provided, we can see the following line items:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 16400000.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: 1461486.34\n\nNext, we sum these two amounts to find the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Costs} = \\text{Cost of Goods Sold} + \\text{Selling Expenses} = 16400000.00 + 1461486.34 = 17861486.34\n\\]\n\nNow, we can format this into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '17861486.34'} }\n```",
