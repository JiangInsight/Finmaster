The relevant accounts here are \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant line items:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**\n   - **Initial Amount:** 0.00\n   - **End Amount:** 2000000.00\n\n2. **Taxes Payable**\n   - **Initial Amount:** 0.00\n   - **End Amount:** 1143833.89\n\nNow we will extract the initial and final values for the amount owed (liabilities):\n\n- For \"Accounts Payable\":\n  - Initial Value: 0.00\n  - End Value: 2000000.00\n  \n- For \"Taxes Payable\":\n  - Initial Value: 0.00\n  - End Value: 1143833.89\n\nNext, we can summarize the information. We only need to show the initial and end values encompassing all liabilities. In order to show a comprehensive summary, we can use a \"Total\" representation as well.\n\nThe initial total amount owed was 0.00, and the final total amount owed is the sum of the amounts from \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable.\"\n\nCalculating the total end value:\n- Total End Value = End Value of Accounts Payable + End Value of Taxes Payable\n- Total End Value = 2000000.00 + 1143833.89 = 3143833.89\n\nThus, the total initial amount is 0.00, and the final total amount owed is 3143833.89.\n\nThe final output will be:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3143833.89'}}\n```",
