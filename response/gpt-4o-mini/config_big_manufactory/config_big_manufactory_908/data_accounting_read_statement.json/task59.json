                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to extract specific line items from three financial statements: Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, and Income Statement. The two line items we are looking for are:\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received** (typically found as \"Interest Receivable\" in the Balance Sheet).\n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period** (found as \"Net Increase\" in the Cash Flow Statement).\n\nLet's go through each of the provided financial statements step by step.\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\nThe relevant item here is the \"Interest Receivable\":\n- **Interest Receivable**: End amount is 13240.11.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow Statement\nThe relevant item here is the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents:\n- **Net Increase**: This figure is -19501430.98, indicating a decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the period.\n\n### 3. Income Statement\nWhile it's important for context, the Income Statement does not contain lines specifically pertinent to our requirement for cash equivalents or interest not yet received.\n\nAfter reviewing the data from each statement, we can summarize our findings:\n\n- From the **Balance Sheet**: \n  - Value1 (Interest Receivable) = 13240.11 \n- From the **Cash Flow Statement**: \n  - Value2 (Net Increase) = -19501430.98 \n\nWe can now put this information into the required JSON format.\n\n### Solution\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13240.11', 'value2': '-19501430.98'}}\n```",
