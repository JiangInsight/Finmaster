In the provided cash flow statement, we see:\n\n   - **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: This is the line item that pertains to the inventory or assets related to sales.\n\n2. **Extract the Value**: The cash flow statement specifies that under the line item **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**, the amount is **-6600000.00**. \n   \n3. **Understand the Context**: The negative sign indicates a reduction in inventory. This is what we are looking for as it represents the decrease in assets that are being manufactured or are available for sale.\n\nGiven this assessment, the specific value we need to use is right from the line item identified.\n\nNow, I can format this into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-6600000.00'} }\n```",
