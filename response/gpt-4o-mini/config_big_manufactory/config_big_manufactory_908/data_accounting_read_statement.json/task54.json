It includes costs for materials and labor directly used in the creation of a product.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses** - $1,461,486.34\n   - These expenses are associated with the costs of selling products or services. They can include costs related to advertising, promotions, and sales personnel salaries.\n\nTogether, these two line items reflect the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver the goods and services.\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: $16,400,000.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: $1,461,486.34\n\nNow, summing them we get:\n- Total Costs = COGS + Selling Expenses = $16,400,000.00 + $1,461,486.34 = $17,861,486.34\n\nHowever, since the task asks for a specific line item value and given the nature of how costs incurred are typically represented in the financial statements, I will primarily report the **Cost of Goods Sold** as the main line item related to delivering goods and services.\n\nThus, the solution will report the value of **Cost of Goods Sold** only:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '16400000.00'} }\n```",
