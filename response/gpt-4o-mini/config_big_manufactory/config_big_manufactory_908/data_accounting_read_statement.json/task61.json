                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to extract specific line items from the provided financial statements. The two specific items we are looking for are:\n\n1. Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers (which corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the income statement).\n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment, and other long-term assets (which is referred to as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the cash flow statement).\n\nNow let's break this down step by step according to the provided financial statements:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Balance Sheet\nWe want to see if there's any relevant line item in the balance sheet linked to the specified costs; however, such costs are usually not reflected in it. The balance sheet typically focuses on the assets, liabilities, and equities of the company at a certain point in time.\n\nIn this case, there is no item relating directly to the costs incurred to secure orders or service delivery or cash payments for assets in the balance sheet. Therefore, we can skip this section for our specific values.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Income Statement\nThe income statement is where we find the costs associated with securing customer orders and delivering the goods and services. \n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: The relevant line item is \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which is 16,400,000.00.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Cash Flow Statement\nNow, we need to look for cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment.\n\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This line item shows cash payments, which in this case is 2,729,032.26.\n\n### Step 4: Compile the results\nAccording to our analysis:\n- From the income statement, we extract the value for \"Cost of Goods Sold\" which we can label as `value1`.\n- From the cash flow statement, we extract the value for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which we can label as `value2`.\n\n### Final JSON Format\nBased on these findings:\n- value1: 16400000.00 \n- value2: 2729032.26 \n\nNow we present this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16400000.00', 'value2': '2729032.26'} }\n```",
