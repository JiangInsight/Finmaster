In the provided problem, the relevant section is as follows:\n\n1. **Fixed Assets**: This usually includes property, plant, and equipment that are used in operations and are not meant for sale.\n2. **Accumulated Depreciation**: This represents a reduction in value of fixed assets, and while it is not an asset itself, it impacts the net value of fixed assets.\n3. **Total Non-current Assets**: This represents the total of fixed assets after accounting for accumulated depreciation.\n\nFrom the entries we can see:\n- Initial amount for **Fixed Assets**: 8000000.00\n- End amount for **Fixed Assets**: 10729032.26\n- Initial amount for **Accumulated Depreciation**: 0.00\n- End amount for **Accumulated Depreciation**: 120631.67\n\nTo calculate the **Total Non-current Assets**:\n- Initial Total Non-current Assets: 8000000.00\n- End Total Non-current Assets: 10608400.59\n\nAssuming our focus is on **Total Non-current Assets** (as they are referenced specifically in the problem), we will report these values.\n\nFinal summary:\n- Initial amount of Total Non-current Assets = 8000000.00\n- End amount of Total Non-current Assets = 10608400.59\n\nThe required JSON for the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10608400.59'} }\n```",
