We see that the line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is present in the section for Operating Activities.\n2. The amount listed for this line item is **2000000.00**.\n\nThus, the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is indeed reflected in this line item.\n\nWith this in mind, we can format our solution as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2000000.00'} }\n```",
