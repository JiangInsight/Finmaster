This is typically captured under \"Accounts Receivable.\"\n\nLet's analyze the relevant entries in the provided balance sheet data:\n\n1. **Accounts Receivable**: \n   - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n   - Initial Date: `2023-12-31`\n   - End Amount: `15362611.64`\n   - End Date: `2024-02-05`\n\nFrom this, we can see:\n- The initial value of Accounts Receivable was `0.00`.\n- The end value of Accounts Receivable, which reflects the amount owed to the entity at the end of the period, is `15362611.64`.\n\nSince Accounts Receivable represents amounts owed for goods or services sold on credit, this is the line item we focus on.\n\nNow we can prepare the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '15362611.64'} }\n```",
