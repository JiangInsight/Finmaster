                        "content": "To solve the task of identifying the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, we need to look at the financial statements provided. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Balance Sheet**:\n   - The balance sheet provides the values of inventory at the start and end of the reporting period. However, these figures represent inventory on hand at those points in time and do not directly tell us the cost of inventory sold during the period.\n\n2. **Referring to the Income Statement**:\n   - The income statement is important as it contains the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item, which directly tells us the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period. \n   - According to the income statement provided, the value of \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is \\( 16,400,000.00 \\).\n\n3. **Final Extraction**:\n   - Based on the income statement, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is \\( 16,400,000.00 \\).\n\nTherefore, the solution based on the provided data is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '16400000.00'} }\n```",
