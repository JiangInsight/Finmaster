The accounts that likely reflect amounts owed for goods or services received on credit are:\n     - **Accounts Payable**\n     - **Taxes Payable**\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Line Items**:\n   - Looking at the **Accounts Payable**:\n     -  **Accounts Payable** has changed from **0.00** (initial amount) to **2000000.00** (ending amount).\n   - Looking at the **Taxes Payable**:\n     - **Taxes Payable** has changed from **0.00** (initial amount) to **1143833.89** (ending amount).\n\n3. **Calculating Total Credit Received**:\n   - The total increase in liabilities representing credit received for goods/services can be considered as the sum of the changes in Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable:\n     - Change in Accounts Payable = 2000000.00\n     - Change in Taxes Payable = 1143833.89\n\n   Therefore, the total additions in liabilities is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Addition} = 2000000.00 + 1143833.89 = 3143833.89\n   \\]\n\n4. **Presenting the Answer**:\n   - Since the task requires only the addition amount owed by the entity, we will focus on the accounts that reflect amounts owed due to credit purchases. The relevant figure will be the value of Accounts Payable which stands at 2000000.00.\n\n### Final Solution in Required Format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2000000.00'}}\n```",
