We need to find its value to satisfy the requirement.\n\n3. **Find the Depreciation Value**: From the income statement, we can see:\n   - **Depreciation**: 120631.67\n\n4. **Check Other Financial Statements**: It's good to confirm that this value is consistent across other financial statements (for instance, the cash flow from operating activities):\n   - In the cash flow statement, there is also a line item for \"Depreciation\" with the same amount: 120631.67.\n\n5. **Final Confirmation**: Both the income statement and cash flow statement confirm that the depreciation expense allocated for the period is 120631.67.\n\nThus, the extracted value for the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is 120631.67.\n\nNow, let's format this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '120631.67'} }\n```",
