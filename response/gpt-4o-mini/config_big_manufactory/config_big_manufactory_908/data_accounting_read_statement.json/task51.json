We will examine the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement closely for related entries.\n\nFrom the **balance sheet** provided, we see:\n\n| Account | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount | End_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Interest Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 13240.11 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThe Interest Receivable account reflects interest accrued but not yet received. \n\n1. **Initial Amount**: In the balance sheet, the initial amount of Interest Receivable is **0.00** as of 2023-12-31.\n2. **End Amount**: The end amount of Interest Receivable was **13240.11** as of 2024-02-05.\n\nNext, we will confirm that this account is indeed related to interest that has accrued:\n\nFrom the **income statement**, we see:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Interest Income | 13240.11 | 2024-02-05 |\n\nThis indicates that the same amount recorded in the Interest Receivable line was recognized as income in the income statement, confirming that it has accrued.\n\nTherefore, we have identified the initial and final values for interest accrued but not yet received.\n\nNow we can formulate the final solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '13240.11'} }\n```",
