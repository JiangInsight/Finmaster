The end amounts align with the provided figures in the balance sheet for total current liabilities.\n\nThe next step is to compile the initial and end amounts for total current liabilities.\n\n- **Initial value**: For total current liabilities, this is 0.00.\n- **End value**: The end amount is 3,143,833.89.\n\nThus, formatting this into the required JSON structure, we have:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3143833.89'} }\n```",
