Identify Sales Transactions:\nWe will extract all 'Sale' transactions, including relevant fields such as `amount` (total sales), `cost_amount`, and `profit` for each sale.\n\n#### 2. Identify Purchase Transactions:\nExtract all 'Purchase' transactions to get the total costs of goods that corresponds to sales.\n\n#### 3. Calculate Totals:\n- **Total Sales Revenue** = Sum of all sales `amount`.\n- **Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** = Sum of all `cost_amount` related to sold goods.\n- **Gross Profit** = Total Sales Revenue - Total COGS.\n\n### Transaction Breakdown - Example\n\nFor the provided transactions, we have sales like:\n- Sale20240103002: Amount = 1302111.59, Cost = 1000000.0\n- Sale20240108007: Amount = 1460946.33, Cost = 1000000.0\n- Sale20240109009: Amount = 1489365.79, Cost = 1000000.0\n- Sale20240125027: Amount = 2008346.63, Cost = 1500000.0\n- Sale20240130032: Amount = 1384532.44, Cost = 1000000.0\n\nAnd purchases like:\n- Purchase (all relevant costs)\n\n#### Example Calculations:\n``` \nTotal Sales Revenue = 1302111.59 + 1460946.33 + 1489365.79 + 2008346.63 + 1384532.44\nTotal COGS = 1000000.0 + 1000000.0 + 1000000.0 + 1500000.0 + 1000000.0\n```\n\n#### Total Amounts:\n- **Total Sales Revenue** = 1302111.59 + 1460946.33 + 1489365.79 + 2008346.63 + 1384532.44 = 7841749.78\n- **Total COGS** = 1000000.0 + 1000000.0 + 1000000.0 + 1500000.0 + 1000000.0 = 5500000.0\n\n#### Gross Profit Calculation:\n- **Gross Profit** = Total Sales Revenue - Total COGS = 7841749.78 - 5500000.0 = 2341749.78\n\n### Formatted Solution\nPutting our result into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit': '2341749.78'}}\n```\n\nThis format includes the calculated gross profit as required.",
