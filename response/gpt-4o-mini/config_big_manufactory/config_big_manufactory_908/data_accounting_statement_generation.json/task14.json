The data provided can then be analyzed to determine the initial and final amounts of current liabilities.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Current Liabilities\nInitially, we will look for any transactions before 2024-01-01 that indicate current liabilities. Based on the transactions:\n- None of the initial transactions are classified under current liabilities, as they are primarily deposits, fixed asset purchases, and expenses.\n\nThus, the initial total current liabilities are **0.00**.\n\n### Step 2: Final Current Liabilities\nNext, we will examine the subsequent transactions to identify any liabilities created during that period, particularly focusing on purchases and expenses that fall under accounts payable or other liabilities.\n\nTaking a closer look at the transactions that indicate liabilities:\n- **Purchase Transactions:**\n    - `Purchase20231231001`: **2000000.0** (Paid)\n    - `Purchase20231231002`: **1500000.0** (Paid)\n    - `Purchase20231231003`: **1600000.0** (Paid)\n   \n   Here, the remaining liabilities that are unpaid are:\n   - **2000000.0** from the `Purchase20231231001` marked as \"Unpaid\".\n\nNo other liabilities indicate current liabilities in this context.\n\n- **Other expenses** such as admin, sales expenses, and interest may indicate the amount spent but they are classified as expenses, not liabilities. \n\n### Summary of Calculated Values:\n1. **Initial Current Liabilities:** **0.00**\n2. **Final Current Liabilities:** **2000000.0** (Since only Purchase20231231001 is an unpaid amount)\n\n### Final Results:\nWe translate our findings into the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '2000000.0'}}\n```",
