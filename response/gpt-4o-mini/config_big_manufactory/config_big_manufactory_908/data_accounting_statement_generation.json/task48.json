Cash Deposits\n   - 5,000,000 (Initial) \n   - 15,000,000 (Bank Deposit)\n   - 8,000,000 (Fixed Assets)\n   - 1,302,111.59 (Sale on 2024-01-03)\n   - 2,000,000.0 (Sale on 2024-01-15)\n   - 2,000,000.0 (Sale on 2024-01-20)\n   - 2,000,000.0 (Sale on 2024-01-25)\n   - 2,100,000.0 (Sale on 2024-01-28)\n\n### Outflows\n1. Purchases\n   - 2,000,000 (Purchase on 2023-12-31)\n   - 1,500,000 (Purchase on 2023-12-31)\n   - 1,600,000 (Purchase on 2023-12-31)\n   - 1,500,000 (Purchase on 2023-12-31)\n   - 1,000,000 (Purchase on 2023-12-31)\n   - 1,000,000 (Purchase on 2023-12-31)\n   - 1,000,000 (Purchase on 2023-12-31)\n   - 2,000,000 (Purchase on 2023-12-31)\n   \n2.
