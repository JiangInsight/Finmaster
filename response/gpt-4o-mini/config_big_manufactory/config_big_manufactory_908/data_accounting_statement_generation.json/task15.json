These can include unpaid purchases, accounts payables, or any other transaction that indicates that the company owes money.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Liabilities\nLet's list the transactions that indicate liabilities:\n\n1. **Purchases with \"Unpaid\" status**: These are debts the company has incurred but has not yet paid.\n   - Purchase (Unpaid)\n  \n   After reviewing, the relevant transactions are:\n   - Purchase20231231007: Amount: 1000000.0 (Unpaid)\n   - Purchase20231231013: Amount: 500000.0 (Unpaid)\n\n### Step 2: Initial Total Liabilities\nAt the start of the period, we can see the following transactions which reflect the liabilities:\n\n- **Total Liabilities Initial Value**: \n  - From the identified transactions, total is `0.00` initially \n  \n### Step 3: Final Total Liabilities Calculation\nAt the end, we will sum the amounts owed from the unpaid purchases identified above.\n\n- **Calculating Final Total Liabilities**:\n  - Purchase20231231007: 1000000.0\n  - Purchase20231231013: 500000.0\n\nSo hereâ€™s the calculation:\n- Total Liabilities = 1000000.0 + 500000.0 \n- Thus, Total Liabilities End Value = **1500000.0**\n\n### Conclusion\n- Total Liabilities Initial Value = `0.00`\n- Total Liabilities End Value = `1500000.0`\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '1500000.00'}}\n```",
