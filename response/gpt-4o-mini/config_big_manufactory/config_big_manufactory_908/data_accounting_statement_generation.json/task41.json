We will also need to calculate the adjustments due to payments made against previously incurred payables.\n\n### Step 1: Identify relevant transactions\nWe will look for:\n1. **Purchases** that are marked as \"Unpaid\" (which increase accounts payable).\n2. **Purchases** with a status indicating an unpaid obligation (like \"Account Payable\").\n3. **Expenses** that show a reduction in accounts payable (indicated as \"Paid\").\n\n### Step 2: Aggregate amounts\n#### Increase Transactions (Purchases)\nFrom the data, we will consider the following purchases that are unpaid:\n- Purchase of Heavy Equipment C for **1,000,000.0** on **2024-01-11** (Unpaid - Account Payable)\n- Purchase of Heavy Equipment A for **1,500,000.0** on **2024-01-21** (Unpaid - Account Payable)\n\n**Total Increase in Accounts Payable**:\n- **1,000,000.0 + 1,500,000.0 = 2,500,000.0**\n\n#### Decrease Transactions (Payments on Expenses)\nNext, we will consider payments made against expenses:\nAs per the data provided, we have amounts that have been paid, but those are mostly expenses and won't affect the accounts payable as they are paid, thus causing no immediate change to accounts payable. \n\n### Step 3: Calculate the final accounts payable\n1. The increase due to unpaid purchases is calculated as **2,500,000.0**.\n2. There were no payments made that reduce amounts tied as accounts payable from the given data.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe final increase in Accounts Payable stands at **2,500,000.0**. \n\n### Format the result\nNow, we will format our answer in the provided JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '2500000.00'} }\n```",
