                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Total Debt**: Total liabilities will include current liabilities and any non-current debts. Since we are only provided information about current liabilities on the balance sheet, we will consider the current liabilities as the total debt for this calculation.\n\n2. **Calculate Cash Flow from Operations**: We will take the figure provided for the net cash flow from operating activities, which reflects the cash that the business generates from its operations.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This is calculated by dividing the Cash Flow from Operations by the Total Debt.\n\n### Given Data:\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities (acting as Total Debt) = 3,143,833.89\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculations:\n1. **Calculate Total Debt**:\n   - Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 3,143,833.89\n\n2. **Cash Flow from Operations**:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -16,772,398.72\n\n3. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Cash Flow from Operations / Total Debt\n   - Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = -16,772,398.72 / 3,143,833.89 = -5.34\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe cash flow to debt ratio is negative, indicating that the company is generating more cash outflow from operations than there is debt capacity availableâ€”this could indicate financial stress. Finally, we can present the result in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-5.34'} }\n```",
