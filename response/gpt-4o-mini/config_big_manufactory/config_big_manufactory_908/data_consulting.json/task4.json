                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio based on the provided balance sheet information, we will first need to derive the total liabilities and total equity. The Debt to Equity Ratio is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Extracting Total Liabilities\nTotal liabilities are typically calculated from current liabilities. Here, from the balance sheet, we have:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**: 2,000,000.00\n2. **Taxes Payable**: 1,143,833.89\n\nSo, the total current liabilities can be summed up as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Current Liabilities} = \\text{Accounts Payable} + \\text{Taxes Payable} = 2,000,000.00 + 1,143,833.89 = 3,143,833.89\n\\]\n\nSince no long-term liabilities are mentioned, we can assume that total liabilities equal total current liabilities, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Liabilities} = 3,143,833.89\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Extracting Total Equity\nTotal equity consists of:\n\n1. **Paid-in Capital**: 28,000,000.00\n2. **Retained Earnings**: 1,938,987.47\n\nThus, the total owner's equity is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Owner's Equity} = \\text{Paid-in Capital} + \\text{Retained Earnings} = 28,000,000.00 + 1,938,987.47 = 29,938,987.47\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nNow that we have the total liabilities and total equity, we can calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} = \\frac{3,143,833.89}{29,938,987.47}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the ratio yields:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} \\approx 0.1057\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Formatting the result\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the Debt to Equity Ratio would be presented as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} \\approx 0.11\n\\]\n\n### Final Step: Result in JSON Format\nNow, we'll format the final result as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.11'}}\n```",
