                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Net Revenue:**\n   - From the income statement, the total revenue is the appropriate figure to use, which is **22,876,677.56**.\n\n2. **Calculate the Average Accounts Receivable:**\n   - We deduce the average accounts receivable from the balance sheet. Since we only have the ending balance for accounts receivable, we'll assume there was no beginning balance.\n   - The ending accounts receivable as of the latest date (2024-02-05) is **15,362,611.64**.\n   - To compute the average, we can consider it as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable}}{2}\n     \\]\n   - In this case, since the beginning balance is **0**, it simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 15,362,611.64}{2} = 7,681,305.82\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio:**\n   - The formula for the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{22,876,677.56}{7,681,305.82} \\approx 2.98\n     \\]\n\n4. **Present the Solution:**\n   - Based on the calculations, the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is approximately **2.98**.\n\nNow, we format the final answer as per the instruction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.98'}}\n```",
