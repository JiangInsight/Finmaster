                        "content": "To calculate the total cost from the provided income statement transactions, we need to sum all the relevant costs from different categories based on their types. We will include the following types of expenses as part of the total cost: purchases, administrative expenses, and financial expenses. We will also exclude revenues or receipts since those do not count towards the total cost. \n\nLet's go through the key transactions and sum up their amounts:\n\n1. **Fixed Assets** - These typically wouldn't count towards the immediate cost but are part of capital expenditures. However, if they are included as part of the total costs, the values would be entered in.\n2. **Purchases**:\n   - Purchase for Heavy Equipment B: 800000.0\n   - Purchase for Heavy Equipment C: 2000000.0\n   - Purchase for Heavy Equipment B: 800000.0\n   - Purchase for Heavy Equipment A: 1000000.0\n   - Purchase for Heavy Equipment D: 3000000.0\n   - Purchase for Heavy Equipment A: 1000000.0 \n   - Purchase for Heavy Equipment D: 3000000.0\n   \n   Total Purchases = 800000 + 2000000 + 800000 + 1000000 + 3000000 + 1000000 = **11780000.0**\n\n3. **Administrative Expenses**:\n   - 31077.04\n   - 72434.17\n   - 41635.89\n   - 50312.93\n   - 49974.11\n   - 39503.53\n   - 65687.23\n   - 32249.23\n   - 57359.96\n   - 45859.58\n   \n   Total Admin Expenses: 31077.04 + 72434.17 + 41635.89 + 50312.93 + 49974.11 + 39503.53 + 65687.23 + 32249.23 + 57359.96 = **411935.49**\n\n4. **Sales Expenses**:\n   - 73422.33\n   - 50312.93\n   - 18529.12\n   - 83043.95\n   - 30521.87\n   - 85787.82\n   - 78068.15\n   - 20565.7\n   - 79415.78\n   - 29336.31\n   - 14158.49\n   - 72125.7\n   - 16489.93\n   - 68047.29\n   - 26885.73\n\n   Total Sales Expenses: 73422.33 + 50312.93 + 18529.12 + 83043.95 + 30521.87 + 85787.82 + 78068.15 + 20565.7 + 79415.78 + 29336.31 + 14158.49 + 72125.7 + 16489.93 + 68047.29 + 26885.73 = **631656.84**\n\n5. **Financial Expenses**:\n   - 88194.75 \n   - 52101.64 \n   - 29540.71\n   \n   Total Financial Expenses: 88194.75 + 52101.64 + 29540.71 = **169836.10**\n\nNow let's sum these totals together.\n\n- Total cost = Total Purchases + Total Admin Expenses + Total Sales Expenses + Total Financial Expenses\n\nTotal cost = 11780000.0 + 411935.49 + 631656.84 + 169836.10 = **12962828.43**\n\nNow, let's format the answer in a JSON object as per the requirement:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Cost': '12962828.43'} }\n```",
