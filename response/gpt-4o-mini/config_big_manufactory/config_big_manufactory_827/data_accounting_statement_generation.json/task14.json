In this dataset, we will look specifically for `Purchase` types that have a status of \"Unpaid\" since they represent obligations the company still owes and thus form part of the current liabilities.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Transactions:**\n   We will filter through all the entries to find those of type `Purchase` that are marked as `Unpaid`.\n\n2. **Calculate Initial Current Liabilities:**\n   From the data provided in the initial section, we see that there are no unpaid purchases, which means the initial current liabilities value at the start of the year is zero.\n\n3. **Calculate Final Current Liabilities:**\n   Now, we go through the transactions that are relevant to see how many `Purchase` entries are marked as unpaid in the later transactions.\n\n### Filter Transactions for Current Liabilities:\n\n- Looking through the dataset, we identify the purchases with an unpaid status.\n\nHere are the unpaid purchases:\n\n- **Purchase:**\n   - Date: 2023-12-31, Amount: 800000.0 (Unpaid)\n   - Date: 2024-01-17, Amount: 1000000.0 (Unpaid)\n   - Date: 2024-01-25, Amount: 1000000.0 (Unpaid)\n\n### Sum the Amounts:\n\nThe total current liabilities at the end can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Total current liabilities (unpaid purchases):\n   - 800000.0 + 1000000.0 + 1000000.0 = 2800000.0\n\n### Final Values:\n\n- **Initial Total Current Liabilities**: 0.00\n- **Final Total Current Liabilities**: 2800000.00\n\n### Prepare the Solution:\n\nNow, presenting the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '2800000.00'} }\n```",
