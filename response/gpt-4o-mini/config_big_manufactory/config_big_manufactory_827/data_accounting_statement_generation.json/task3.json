                        "content": "To solve the problem of calculating the initial and end inventory values based on the provided transaction data, we need to analyze the transactions that involve purchases and sales of inventory items.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n**Initial Inventory Calculation:**\n1. We look for the records tagged as \"Initial\" in the transactions. In this case, we have three records showing:\n   - Cash deposits: 5,000,000\n   - Bank deposits: 15,000,000\n   - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000\n\n   None of these contribute to the inventory directly; therefore, the initial inventory value is **0**.\n\n**Purchases and Sales Calculation (for End Inventory):**\n1. **Purchases:**\n   - Purchase of Heavy Equipment B: 800,000 (Qty: 1)\n   - Purchase of Heavy Equipment C: 2,000,000 (Qty: 2)\n   - Purchase of Heavy Equipment A: 1,000,000 (Qty: 2)\n   - Purchase of Heavy Equipment D: 3,000,000 (Qty: 2)\n   - Purchase of Heavy Equipment A: 1,000,000 (Qty: 2)\n  \n   Sum of Purchases:\n   - Heavy Equipment B: 800,000\n   - Heavy Equipment C: 2,000,000\n   - Heavy Equipment A: 1,000,000\n   - Heavy Equipment D: 3,000,000\n   - Heavy Equipment A: 1,000,000 again if counted from direct purchase record.\n\n2. **Sales:**\n   - Sale of Heavy Equipment B: Sold 1 (Sold for 1,126,403.16)\n   - Sale of Heavy Equipment C: Sold 1 (Sold for 1,354,106.17)\n   - Sale of Heavy Equipment A: Sold 1 (Sold for 684,558.74)\n   - Sale of Heavy Equipment D: Sold 1 (Sold for 2,072,499.57)\n\n   Total inventory sold is essentially what is produced from the sales transactions for Heavy Equipment where quantities match.\n\n**End Inventory Calculation:**\n- I will now compute the purchases against sales to see if there are remaining inventory items. \n\n### Inventory Calculation:\n- Total Purchases: \n   - Heavy Equipment B: 800,000\n   - Heavy Equipment C: 2,000,000\n   - Heavy Equipment A: 1,000,000 \n   - Heavy Equipment D: 3,000,000 \n   - Heavy Equipment A: 1,000,000 \n\n   Total Inventory = 800,000 + 2,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 7,800,000\n   \n- Total Sales: \n   - Heavy Equipment B (1): 1,126,403.16\n   - Heavy Equipment C (1): 1,354,106.17\n   - Heavy Equipment A (1): 684,558.74\n   - Heavy Equipment D (1): 2,072,499.57\n\n   The warehouse ends up without taking into account also that we sold one of each but selling off the ending values against what still remains doesn't fit to make it empty; we're counting all as sold as one by one.\n\n### Inventory End Value:\n- Since we've recognized no residual cost at the end as it was reduced based upon transactions kept running without returning – total expense counts – any further cut isn't delivering positive at any round.\n\n### Final Results:\n- Initial Inventory Value: **0.00**\n- End Inventory Value: **5,090,000.00**\n\nPutting this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '5090000.00'}}\n```",
