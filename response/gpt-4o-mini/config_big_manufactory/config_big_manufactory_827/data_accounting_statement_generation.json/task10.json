                        "content": "To calculate the total non-current assets for both the initial and final values, we need to analyze the provided financial transactions that affect non-current assets. \n\nInitially, we have the following relevant transactions for the total non-current assets (assets that are intended for long-term use):\n\n---\n**Initial Non-current Assets:**\n1. Cash deposit: **5,000,000.00**\n2. Bank deposit: **15,000,000.00**\n3. Fixed Assets: **8,000,000.00**\n   \n   **Total Initial Non-current Assets = Cash Deposit + Bank Deposit + Fixed Assets**\n   - Initial Value = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000\n\n**Purchases and Adjustments:**\n4. Purchase of Heavy Equipment B: **800,000.00**\n5. Depreciation: **45,751.31** (this reduces the total non-current assets)\n6. Additional purchases and transactions will adjust this value.\n\n---\nNow we'll analyze subsequent transactions impacting the total amount:\n- **Purchase transactions** for non-current assets will add to the total.\n- **Depreciation** will reduce the total value.\n- **Sales of equipment** will also adjust the values as they may remove something from non-current assets.\n\n### Key transactions affecting non-current assets after the initial:\n1. **Purchase of Heavy Equipment B:** +800,000.00\n2. **Depreciation Expense:** -45,751.31\n3. **Sale of Heavy Equipment:** +1,260,403.16 (accounted as part of asset removal)\n\n### Summarizing the net effect on non-current assets:\nTotal Non-current Assets = Initial + Purchases - Depreciation + Sales\n- Initial Non-current Assets = 28,000,000\n- Total additions from purchases = 800,000.00\n- Total depreciation = 45,751.31\n- Sale value adds back = 1,126,403.16 \n\n**Final Calculation:**\n**Total Non-current Assets = Initial - Depreciation + Purchases + Sale**\n= 28,000,000 + 800,000 - 45,751.31 + 1,126,403.16 = 29,880,651.85\n\n### Final Results\n1. **Total Initial Non-current Assets:** 28,000,000.00 \n2. **Total End Non-current Assets:** 29,880,651.85 \n\n### Solution Format\nNow, we convey these findings in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '28000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '29880651.85'} }\n```",
