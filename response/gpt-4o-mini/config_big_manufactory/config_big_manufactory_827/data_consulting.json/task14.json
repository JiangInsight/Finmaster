                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we must first determine two key figures: the Net Credit Sales and the Average Accounts Receivable. \n\n### Step 1: Determine Net Credit Sales\n\n- The **Total Revenue** from the income statement indicates how much was made from sales. Here, **Total Revenue = 18062437.45**.\n- Since it is implied that all sales are on credit for this analysis (unless stated otherwise), we'll use Total Revenue directly as our Net Credit Sales.\n\n**Net Credit Sales = 18062437.45**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Average Accounts Receivable\n\nThe Average Accounts Receivable is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Accounts Receivable at Beginning} + \\text{Accounts Receivable at End}}{2}\n\\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Accounts Receivable at Beginning (Initial amount)** = 0.00\n- **Accounts Receivable at End** = 10537836.59\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 10537836.59}{2} = \\frac{10537836.59}{2} = 5268918.295\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\nThe formula for the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{18062437.45}{5268918.295} \\approx 3.43\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Present the Answer in Required Format\n\nNow, we can format the result in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '3.43'} }\n```",
