                        "content": "To calculate the required financial ratios based on the given financial statements, we will proceed with the following steps:\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how effectively a company collects its receivables. It is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\n**Total Revenue**: 18,062,437.45 (from the income statement)\n\n**Average Accounts Receivable**: \nSince we only have the ending balance for Accounts Receivable, we will use it directly for simplicity:\n- Ending Accounts Receivable: 10,537,836.59\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{18062437.45}{10537836.59} \\approx 1.71\n\\]\n\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by cash generated from operations. It is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\n**Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -13,358,400.82 (from cash flow statement)\n\n**Total Current Liabilities**: 1,903,121.89\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-13358400.82}{1903121.89} \\approx -7.01\n\\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nIt has the same formula as above. Thus, this ratio will also be:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = -7.01\n\\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures the efficiency of a firm in using its assets to generate revenue. It is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\n**Average Total Assets**: \nWe will just use the ending Total Assets since we do not have the beginning balance for now.\n- Ending Total Assets: 31,154,033.87\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{18062437.45}{31154033.87} \\approx 0.58\n\\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio compares a company’s total liabilities to its shareholders' equity, indicating the proportion of equity and debt used to finance the company’s assets. It is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owners' Equity}}\n\\]\n\n**Total Liabilities**: \n- Total Current Liabilities: 1,903,121.89\n\nTotal Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (assuming there are no additional long-term liabilities)\n\n**Total Owners' Equity**: 29,250,911.98\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1903121.89}{29250911.98} \\approx 0.065\n\\]\n\n### Summary of Calculated Ratios\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: 1.71\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -7.01\n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: -7.01\n4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio: 0.58\n5. Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.065\n\n### Final JSON Solution\nTo summarize the results, we will format them in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '1.71', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-7.01', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-7.01', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.58', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.065'} }\n```",
