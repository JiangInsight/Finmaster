                        "content": "To solve this task, we will calculate both the Gross Profit Margin and the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio using the information provided in the financial statements (balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Gross Profit Margin\nThe Gross Profit Margin is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Gross Profit = 4,962,437.45\n- Total Revenue = 18,062,437.45\n\nUsing these values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{4,962,437.45}{18,062,437.45} \\times 100\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} \\approx 27.48\\%\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThe Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -13,358,400.82\n\nTo find Total Liabilities, we can use the balance sheet. From the balance sheet, we need to find Total Current Liabilities and Total Non-current Liabilities. Total Current Liabilities are provided directly, but we need to compute Total Liabilities from the balance sheet:\n\n- Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity\n- From the balance sheet:\n  - Total Assets = 31,154,033.87\n  - Total Owner's Equity = 29,250,911.98\n  \nCalculating Total Liabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Liabilities} = 31,154,033.87 - 29,250,911.98 = 1,903,121.89\n\\]\n\nFinally, we can calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-13,358,400.82}{1,903,121.89}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} \\approx -7.02\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nNow that we have calculated both metrics:\n\n- Gross Profit Margin: 27.48%\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -7.02\n\nWe can format the results as specified in the desired JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '27.48%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-7.02'}}\n```",
