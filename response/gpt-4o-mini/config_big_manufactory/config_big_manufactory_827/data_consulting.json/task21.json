                        "content": "To calculate the Free Cash Flow (FCF) and Current Assets Turnover Ratio, we'll follow these steps.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Free Cash Flow (FCF)\n\n1. **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: We need to find this amount from the cash flow statement.\n   - From the cash flow statement, Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is **-13358400.82**.\n\n2. **Capital Expenditures (CapEx)**: This represents the cash spent on acquiring fixed assets.\n   - From the cash flow statement, Purchase of Fixed Assets (CapEx) is **2496021.60**.\n\n3. **Formula for FCF**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{FCF} = \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} - \\text{CapEx}\n   \\]\n   Plugging the numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{FCF} = -13358400.82 - 2496021.60 = -15854422.42\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Current Assets Turnover Ratio\n\n1. **Current Assets**: For this calculation, we take the current assets from the balance sheet.\n   - Total Current Assets at the end date (2024-02-05) is **20796970.06**.\n\n2. **Total Revenue**: This is found in the income statement.\n   - Total Revenue is **18062437.45**.\n\n3. **Formula for Current Assets Turnover Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}}\n   \\]\n   Since we only have one end date, we'll use the end amount as a proxy for average current assets for now.\n\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{18062437.45}{20796970.06} \\approx 0.867\n   \\]\n\n### Final Calculations and Answer Formatting\n\nNow we will format the results as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Free Cash Flow (FCF)': '-15854422.42', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.87'}}\n```",
