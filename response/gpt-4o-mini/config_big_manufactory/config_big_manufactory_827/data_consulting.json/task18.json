                        "content": "To calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio, we need to understand both the net cash flow from operating activities and the total current liabilities from the balance sheet. The formula for the Operating Cash Flow Ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**:\n   From the cash flow statement, the net cash flow from operating activities is given as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} = -13358400.82\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify Total Current Liabilities**:\n   From the balance sheet, total current liabilities are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Current Liabilities} = 1903121.89\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the values into the formula**:\n   We put the values into the Operating Cash Flow Ratio formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-13358400.82}{1903121.89}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the ratio**:\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} \\approx -7.01\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio is approximately -7.01, indicating that the company is generating a negative cash flow from its operations compared to its current liabilities. This indicates a concerning financial situation as the company is unable to cover its current liabilities with the cash generated from its operating activities.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-7.01'}}\n```",
