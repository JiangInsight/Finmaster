However, for the sake of this calculation, we will use the increase in accounts payable and tax payable from the operating activities as a proxy for current liabilities.\n   - Increase in Accounts Payable: **1,000,000.00**\n   - Increase in Tax Payable: **903,121.89**\n\n   Together, the total current liabilities based on this information:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Current Liabilities} = 1,000,000.00 + 903,121.89 = 1,903,121.89\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Net Cash Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Ending Cash Balance}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{4,145,577.58}{1,903,121.89}\n   \\]\n\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Ratio} \\approx 2.18\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer Formatting:\nThe result will be presented in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Ratio': '2.18'} }\n```",
