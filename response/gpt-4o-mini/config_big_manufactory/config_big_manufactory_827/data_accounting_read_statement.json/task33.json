The value of income arising from the entity's core operating activities, which is represented by \"Main Business Revenue\".\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which is indicated by \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nNow let's extract those values from the income statement:\n\n- The \"Main Business Revenue\" line item shows an amount of **18062437.45**.\n- The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item indicates an amount of **13100000.00**.\n\nNow that we have both values, we'll format the solution in the specified JSON format.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '18062437.45', 'value2': '13100000.00'} }\n```",
