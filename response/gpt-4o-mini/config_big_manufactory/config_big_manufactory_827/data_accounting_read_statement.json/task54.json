This typically includes costs related to materials, labor, and overhead.\n   - **Selling Expenses**: These expenses may include costs related to marketing, salesforce compensation, advertising, and other costs incurred to sell the goods/services.\n\n3. **Reviewing the Income Statement**:\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold**: 13,100,000.00\n   - **Selling Expenses**: 1,468,071.54\n\n4. **Total Costs Associated with Securing and Delivering Orders**: We add COGS and Selling Expenses together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Cost of Goods Sold} + \\text{Selling Expenses} = 13100000.00 + 1468071.54 = 14568071.54\n   \\]\n\nHowever, in the context of what is being sought (specific costs incurred), we are more interested in the Selling Expenses alone, as they directly correlate to costs incurred in securing orders.\n\n5. **Final Value to Report**: Thus, the specific line item of costs incurred to deliver goods/services to customers is represented by the Selling Expenses.\n\nNow we can present the answer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1468071.54'} }\n```",
