This includes the cost of materials and labor directly used to create the product.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses**: These are the costs incurred specifically to secure customer orders and deliver the goods/services to them. This can include advertising, sales staff salaries, commissions, delivery costs, and any other expenses directly tied to selling the products or services.\n\nNow, let's extract the corresponding line items and their values from the provided income statement:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 13100000.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: 1468071.54\n\nTo find the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services, we will sum these two amounts:\n\nTotal costs = Cost of Goods Sold + Selling Expenses\nTotal costs = 13100000.00 + 1468071.54\nTotal costs = 14568071.54\n\nHowever, the task specifically asks for the line items relating to the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services, which means we need to focus on the Selling Expenses only as the direct operational cost related to selling, not the total of both categories.\n\nThe specific Selling Expenses value is **1468071.54**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1468071.54'} }\n```",
