We will go through each type of financial statement one by one, identifying the necessary line items. \n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Balance Sheet\nWe need to find the line item that indicates amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit, which is represented by **Accounts Receivable**.\n\nThe relevant line items extracted from the Balance Sheet:\n- **Accounts Receivable**: 10,537,836.59\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Income Statement\nNext, we need to identify financing costs incurred by the enterprise. This is denoted by **Financial Expenses**.\n\nThe relevant line item extracted from the Income Statement:\n- **Financial Expenses**: 351,260.94\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Cash Flow Statement\nLastly, we have to find cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment. This is indicated by the entry for the purchase of fixed assets, referred to as **Purchase of Fixed Assets**.\n\nThe relevant line item extracted from the Cash Flow Statement:\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 2,496,021.60\n\n### Summary of the Extracted Values:\n- From the **Balance Sheet**: 10,537,836.59 (Accounts Receivable)\n- From the **Income Statement**: 351,260.94 (Financial Expenses)\n- From the **Cash Flow Statement**: 2,496,021.60 (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\nNow that we have identified the three necessary values, we can format the output.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10537836.59', 'value2': '351260.94', 'value3': '2496021.60'} }\n```",
