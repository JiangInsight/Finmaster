This account typically reflects the money that an organization owes to its suppliers for purchases made on credit.\n\n2. **Evaluating the Values**: According to the balance sheet data provided:\n    - **Accounts Payable**: \n        - Initial amount: 0.00\n        - End amount: 1,000,000.00\n    \n3. **Assessing Other Liabilities**: We also consider **Taxes Payable**, as it also represents a liability, but it's not directly for goods or services received on credit. However, it might be relevant in a broader sense of liabilities owed. The values for **Taxes Payable** are:\n    - Initial amount: 0.00\n    - End amount: 903,121.89\n\n4. **Concluding the Relevant Information**: For the specific request based solely on amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit, we will focus on **Accounts Payable**:\n   - Initial value: 0.00\n   - End value: 1,000,000.00\n\n5. **Formulating the Answer**: Based on the requirement outlined in the instruction, we format the result in the specified JSON format.\n\nTherefore, the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1000000.00'}}\n```",
