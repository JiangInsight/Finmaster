This typically includes \"Accounts Receivable\" and possibly any other receivables that are directly related.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Accounts Receivable:**\n   - From the balance sheet provided, there is a line item labeled \"Accounts Receivable.\"\n   - The initial amount for Accounts Receivable is `0.00`.\n   - The end amount for Accounts Receivable is `10537836.59`.\n\n2. **Check for Other Receivables:**\n   - Other items like \"Interest Receivable\" might include amounts owed but since they are not directly related to selling goods or services on credit, we will not include them.\n  \n3. **Collect Values:**\n   - The initial value of Accounts Receivable is `0.00`.\n   - The end value of Accounts Receivable is `10537836.59`.\n\nNow we can present the findings in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '10537836.59'} }\n```",
