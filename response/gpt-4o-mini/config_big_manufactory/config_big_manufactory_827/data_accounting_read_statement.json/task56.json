The value is:\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: `138957.79`\n- Income Statement: `138957.79`\n\nBoth statements reflect the same depreciation value, affirming the accuracy.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that both the cash flow and income statement indicate a depreciation amount of `138957.79`, we will take this value as our answer.\n\n### Final Answer Format\nWe will present our extracted value in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '138957.79'} }\n```",
