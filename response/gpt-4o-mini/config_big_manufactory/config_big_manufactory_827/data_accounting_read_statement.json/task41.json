Look for the line item that corresponds to the increase in tax payable. In this context, tax payable represents taxes that have accrued but are not yet paid.\n\n2. The relevant line in the statement is:\n   ```\n   Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 903121.89 | 2024-02-05\n   ```\n\n3. From this line, we can see that the increase in tax payable is 903121.89.\n\n4. Hence, our desired value that represents the increase in tax accrued but not yet paid is 903121.89.\n\nNow, I will structure this solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '903121.89'} }\n```",
