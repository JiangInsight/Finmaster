Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of what we need to do:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: \n   The line item representing the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares is \"Paid-in Capital\".\n\n2. **Find the Initial Value**:\n   From the balance sheet, under \"Paid-in Capital\", the initial amount is listed as:\n   - Initial_amount = 28000000.00\n\n3. **Find the Final Value**:\n   Similarly, the final amount for \"Paid-in Capital\" is:\n   - End_amount = 28000000.00\n\n4. **Consolidate the Findings**:\n   We now have both the initial and final values for the capital contributed by shareholders. They are both the same, indicating that there was no change in the capital contributed during this period.\n\n5. **Format the Solution**:\n   Following the requested JSON format, we present this information.\n\nWith all these steps combined, the final solution will be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '28000000.00', 'end value': '28000000.00'}}\n```",
