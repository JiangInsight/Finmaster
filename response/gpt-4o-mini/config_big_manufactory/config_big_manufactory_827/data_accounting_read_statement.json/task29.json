The **Total Revenue** line item shows an amount of **18062437.45**.\n2. The line item **Main Business Revenue** also shows the same amount of **18062437.45**. This indicates the revenue generated from the main business activities.\n3. Since the task requires decomposing this item into its sub-items, we can list its components. In this case, the only relevant sub-item contributing to this total income from ordinary activities is **Main Business Revenue**, which matches the total.\n\nNow, we will format this information into the required JSON structure.\n\nHere's the finalized solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '18062437.45', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '18062437.45'}}\n```",
