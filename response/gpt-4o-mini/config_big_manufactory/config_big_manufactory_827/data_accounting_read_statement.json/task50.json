Let's analyze the cash flow statement step by step:\n\n1. **Depreciation**: This represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. In the cash flow statement, we see:\n   - **Depreciation**: `138957.79`\n\n2. **Reduction in assets held for sale**: This line item corresponds to increases or decreases in inventory, which includes assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business. In the cash flow statement, we find:\n   - **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: `-6100000.00` (noting that a decrease is reflected with a negative value)\n\n3. **Net cash from investing activities**: This is related to cash generated from the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents. The relevant line item here is:\n   - **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: `-2496021.60`\n\n4. **Net increase in cash and cash equivalents**: This refers to the overall change in cash and cash equivalents during the period. We can find this from the statement:\n   - **Net Increase**: `-15854422.42`\n\nNow that we have identified and extracted the necessary values, we can compile the results in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '138957.79', 'value2': '-6100000.00', 'value3': '-2496021.60', 'value4': '-15854422.42'} }\n```",
