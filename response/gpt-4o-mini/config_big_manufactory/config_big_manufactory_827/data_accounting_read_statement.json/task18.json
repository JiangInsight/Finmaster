The value of cash held by the entity that is available for use in day-to-day operations.\n2. Tangible items that are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes (which would include inventory).\n3. The amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid.\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet, we will extract the relevant data:\n\n1. **Cash on Hand**:\n   - Initial Amount: `5000000.00`\n   - End Amount: `3041599.18`\n\n2. **Inventory** (as it is a tangible item and relates to goods):\n   - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n   - End Amount: `6100000.00`\n\n3. **Taxes Payable** (as it represents the tax accrued but not yet paid):\n   - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n   - End Amount: `903121.89`\n\nNow, we will consolidate these values into the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    'initial value1': '5000000.00', \n    'end valu1': '3041599.18', \n    'initial value2': '0.00', \n    'end valu2': '6100000.00', \n    'initial value3': '0.00', \n    'end valu3': '903121.89'\n}}\n```",
