                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify which line items from the balance sheet represent total assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle. This typically includes fixed assets (non-current assets) but excludes current assets like cash, bank deposits, accounts receivable, inventory, and other receivables, as these are expected to be realized or used in the normal operating cycle.\n\nLet's extract the relevant line items from the balance sheet:\n\n1. **Total Current Assets:** This includes cash, bank deposits, accounts receivable, and inventory, which are to be realized in the normal operating cycle.\n2. **Total Non-current Assets:** This includes fixed assets and any accumulated depreciation. Fixed assets are typically regarded as long-term, non-current investments a company makes in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E).\n3. **Total Assets:** This is the sum of current assets and non-current assets.\n\nNow let's find the relevant amounts:\n\n- Initial value of **Total Non-current Assets**: `8000000.00` (as of 2023-12-31).\n- End value of **Total Non-current Assets**: `10357063.81` (as of 2024-02-05).\n\nThe values to be reported are those from the \"Total Non-current Assets\" line item since these are the assets not expected to be realized in the normal course of business.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10357063.81'}}\n```",
