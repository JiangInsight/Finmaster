Locate the section that pertains to \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\". This can typically be identified in the statement as a separate line item or section.\n2. Identify the \"Ending Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" as this reflects the cash available at the end of the period.\n3. The provided cash flow statement starts with the section for \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities,\" and it continues through various activities including \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities.\"\n4. Finally, we find the line item for \"Ending Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" which is specified as \"4145577.58.\"\n\nNow, compiling this information, we can construct the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '4145577.58'} }\n```",
