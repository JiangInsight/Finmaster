We have a table that includes various line items related to the income statement, including revenues, expenses, and net profit.\n2. We are specifically interested in the line item that indicates the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, which is typically represented as \"Depreciation\" in financial statements.\n3. In the provided data, we can see the line:\n   - **Depreciation | 138957.79**\n4. The value associated with \"Depreciation\" is **138957.79**.\n\nNow we will format this extracted value into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '138957.79'} }\n```",
