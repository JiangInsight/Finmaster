From the income statement, this line item has a value of **13100000.00**.\n\n2. **Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation:** This is often represented by **Financial Expenses**. In the income statement, this has a value of **351260.94**.\n\n3. **The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life:** This is represented by the **Depreciation** line item, which in this case has a value of **138957.79**.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period:** This is represented by the **Tax Expense** line item. In this case, it has a value of **903121.89**.\n\nHaving identified and gathered the values for these four specific line items while maintaining the original order, I can now present them in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13100000.00', 'value2': '351260.94', 'value3': '138957.79', 'value4': '903121.89'} }\n```",
