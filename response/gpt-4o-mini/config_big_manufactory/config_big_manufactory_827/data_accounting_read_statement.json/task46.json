Therefore, we can decompose it as:\n     - **Sub-item**: Purchase of Fixed Assets from the cash flow statement.\n\nGiven all the above analysis, we can conclude the solution as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2496021.60', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '2496021.60'}}\n``` \n\nThis JSON structure captures the total net cash flow from investing activities and a single relevant sub-item, which is the cash used for purchasing fixed assets.",
