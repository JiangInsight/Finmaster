Therefore, the initial value of taxes payable is **0.00**.\n\n2. **Final Value of Taxes Payable**:\n   - We need to gather all the applicable `tax_amount` from the recorded transactions, which typically come from sales. \n   - From the transactions, I will compile all tax amounts associated with sales into an accumulated total.\n\nLet's find out the relevant transactions that have taxes included (tax_amount). Here are the transactions with `tax_amount`:\n\n- Sale20240106004: tax_amount = 37404.36\n- Sale20240111008: tax_amount = 57566.83\n- Sale20240119016: tax_amount = 67403.41\n- Sale20240124022: tax_amount = 33868.23\n- Sale20240125024: tax_amount = 110529.26\n- Sale20240126025: tax_amount = 33079.03\n\n**Calculating the total Taxes Payable**:\n- 37404.36 +\n- 57566.83 +\n- 67403.41 +\n- 33868.23 +\n- 110529.26 +\n- 33079.03 = 271850.12\n\nSo, the taxes payable at the end would be **271850.12** when all transactions are considered.\n\nPutting this information together, the final result can be formatted into the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Taxes Payable End Value': '271850.12'}}\n```",
