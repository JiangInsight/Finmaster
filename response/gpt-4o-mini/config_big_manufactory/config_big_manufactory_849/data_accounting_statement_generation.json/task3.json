                        "content": "To approach the task of calculating the initial and final inventory values from the provided transactions, we need to focus on the relevant inventory purchase transactions, as sales would decrease our inventory. \n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Inventory\nThe initial inventory value is typically determined from the opening balance before any transactions take place. In the provided data, we can see there are entries prior to any purchases or sales. Since no explicit inventory value was given before the transactions, we will assume an initial value of **0**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Purchases\nWe will extract the purchase transactions to determine the total value of inventory added. Specifically, we'll extract the value and quantity from the rows in the provided data that are marked as \"Purchase\":\n\n- **Purchase20231231001**: $1,500,000 (1 item of Heavy Equipment D)\n- **Purchase20231231002**: $500,000 (1 item of Heavy Equipment A)\n- **Purchase20231231003**: $1,600,000 (2 items of Heavy Equipment B)\n- **Purchase20231231004**: $3,000,000 (2 items of Heavy Equipment D)\n- **Purchase20231231005**: $1,000,000 (1 item of Heavy Equipment C)\n- **Purchase20231231006**: $2,000,000 (2 items of Heavy Equipment C)\n- **Purchase20231231007**: $1,000,000 (2 items of Heavy Equipment A)\n- **Purchase20231231008**: $1,000,000 (1 item of Heavy Equipment A)\n- **Purchase20231231009**: $1,000,000 (2 items of Heavy Equipment A)\n- **Purchase20231231010**: $500,000 (1 item of Heavy Equipment A)\n- **Purchase20231231011**: $1,500,000 (1 item of Heavy Equipment D)\n- **Purchase20231231012**: $1,500,000 (1 item of Heavy Equipment D)\n- **Purchase20231231013**: $500,000 (1 item of Heavy Equipment A)\n- **Purchase20231231014**: $1,000,000 (1 item of Heavy Equipment C)\n\n### Step 3: Summing the Purchases\nNow, let's sum these purchases:\n- Purchase Total:\n  - $1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D)\n  - $500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n  - $1,600,000 (Heavy Equipment B)\n  - $3,000,000 (Heavy Equipment D)\n  - $1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C)\n  - $2,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C)\n  - $1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n  - $1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n  - $1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n  - $500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n  - $1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D)\n  - $1,500,000 (Heavy Equipment D)\n  - $500,000 (Heavy Equipment A)\n  - $1,000,000 (Heavy Equipment C)\n\nAdding those amounts results in:\n- $1,500,000 + $500,000 + $1,600,000 + $3,000,000 + $1,000,000 + $2,000,000 + $1,000,000 + $1,000,000 + $1,000,000 + $500,000 + $1,500,000 + $1,500,000 + $500,000 + $1,000,000 = $15,700,000\n\n### Step 4: Final Inventory Calculation\nTo determine the end inventory, we will need to subtract the total value of sales from the total value of purchases. However, the initial problem states no sales should count towards the initial balance:\n\n### Final Result\n- **Inventory Initial Value** = $0\n- **Inventory End Value** = $15,700,000 (based solely on purchases)\n\nThe results in the desired JSON format are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '15700000.00'} }\n```",
