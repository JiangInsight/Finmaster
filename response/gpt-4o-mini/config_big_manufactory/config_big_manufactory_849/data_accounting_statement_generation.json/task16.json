                        "content": "To determine the Paid-in Capital from the given transactions, we'll sum up the values categorized as initial contributions (deposits and capital contributions) and check for any changes from sales and purchases. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Initial Capital Contribution**: We need to identify the transactions that indicate initial capital injection. These transactions usually involve cash deposits or bank deposits noted in the \"Initial\" transaction types.\n\n2. **Extracting Initial Values**:\n   - From the initial transactions:\n      - Cash deposit: **5,000,000.00**\n      - Bank deposit: **15,000,000.00**\n      - Fixed Assets: **8,000,000.00** (not relevant for paid-in capital as itâ€™s not cash or contributions)\n   - Total Initial Paid-in Capital = 5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 = **20,000,000.00**\n\n3. **Final Paid-in Capital Value**: To compute this, we first ensure that there are no adjustments to paid-in capital in subsequent transactions:\n   - Look for other transactions that may increase or decrease the capital balance:\n      - Purchases or depreciations do not impact the Paid-in Capital directly unless they involve a contribution or adjustment.\n      - The majority of transactions seem related to expenses, which also do not affect the paid-in capital.\n\n4. **Final Check**: Since there are no capital decreases or additional contributions noted that would affect the initial amount, the final paid-in capital remains at its initial value.\n\n5. **Final Result**:\n   - Initial Paid-in Capital: **20,000,000.00**\n   - Final Paid-in Capital: **20,000,000.00** (same as the initial since there are no adjustments).\n\nThus, the solution can be formatted as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '20000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '20000000.00'}}\n```",
