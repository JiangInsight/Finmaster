This is usually represented in the records with the type \"Fixed Assets Purchase\" or relevant purchase types. \n\nLet's review the relevant entries for fixed assets purchases:\n\n1. **FixedAsset20231231001**:\n   - Amount: **886161.25**\n   - Type: Fixed Assets Purchase\n\n2. **Purchase20231231004**:\n   - Amount: **3000000.0**\n   - This is a purchase related to heavy equipment and is tagged as unpaid, which implies it should still be counted in the purchase of fixed assets.\n\n3. **FixedAsset20231231001**:\n   - Amount: **839853.83**\n   - Type: Fixed Assets Purchase\n\n4. **FixedAsset20231231012**: \n   - Amount: **1500000.0**\n   - Type: Fixed Assets Purchase\n\n5. **Purchase20231231010**:\n   - Amount: **500000.0**\n   - Type: This is a direct purchase, hence counts as an acquisition of fixed assets.\n\nNow we will sum these amounts:\n\n- FixedAsset20231231001: **886161.25**\n- Purchase20231231004: **3000000.0**\n- FixedAsset20231231001 (again): **839853.83**\n- FixedAsset20231231012: **1500000.0**\n- Purchase20231231010: **500000.0**\n\nCalculating the total:\n\n- Total Purchase of Fixed Assets = 886161.25 + 3000000.0 + 839853.83 + 1500000.0 + 500000.0\n\nLet's do the math:\n```plaintext\n886161.25 + 3000000.0 + 839853.83 + 1500000.0 + 500000.0 = 6750015.08\n```\n\nNow, we can fill the total in the required JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '6750015.08'} }\n```",
