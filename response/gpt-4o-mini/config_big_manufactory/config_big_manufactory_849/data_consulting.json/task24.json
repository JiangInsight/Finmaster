                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio and Net Cash Ratio, let's first understand what each of these ratios signifies and how we derive them from the provided financial statements.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet, we can extract:\n- **Total Assets**: \\$33,610,271.98 (as of end date)\n- **Total Liabilities**: \n  - Total current liabilities can be drawn from Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Total Current Liabilities} = \\text{Accounts Payable} + \\text{Taxes Payable} = 3,500,000.00 + 819,436.82 = 4,319,436.82\n    \\]\n\nThus, **Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = \\$4,319,436.82**.\n\nNow we can compute the Debt to Asset Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{4,319,436.82}{33,610,271.98} \\approx 0.128\n\\]\n\nConverting to two decimal places gives us approximately **0.13**.\n\n### 2. Net Cash Ratio\nThe Net Cash Ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures the ability of a company to pay off its short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents). The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, we see:\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents (Ending Balance)**: \\$11,957,579.48\n\nWe already calculated **Total Current Liabilities** as **\\$4,319,436.82**.\n\nNow we compute the Net Cash Ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Cash Ratio} = \\frac{11,957,579.48}{4,319,436.82} \\approx 2.77\n\\]\n\nFinally, rounding to two decimal places, we have approximately **2.77**.\n\n### Final Answer\nNow that we have both the ratios calculated, we present the answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13', 'Net Cash Ratio': '2.77'} }\n```",
