                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio, we will first need to gather the necessary data from the provided balance sheet.\n\n**1. Understanding the concept of Debt to Asset Ratio:**\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\n**2. Collecting the appropriate figures:**\nFrom the balance sheet data:\n- **Total Assets** = 33,610,271.98 (as per the \"Total Assets\" row).\n- **Total Liabilities** can be calculated as the sum of Total Current Liabilities, which equals Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable:\n  - Accounts Payable = 3,500,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable = 819,436.82\n  - Therefore, Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 3,500,000.00 + 819,436.82 = 4,319,436.82\n\n**3. Calculating Total Liabilities:**\nAssuming that all liabilities are current (as there are no other liabilities listed), we can use Total Current Liabilities as an approximation for Total Liabilities:\n- **Total Liabilities** = 4,319,436.82\n\n**4. Applying the calculation:**\nNow we will apply the figures to the Debt to Asset Ratio formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{4,319,436.82}{33,610,271.98}\n\\]\nCalculating this ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} \\approx 0.128 (when rounded to three decimal places)\n\\]\n\n**5. Presenting the final answer:**\nIn the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13'}}\n``` \n\nNote: While the precise ratio is approximately 0.128, it is rounded to two decimal places for presentation here as '0.13'.",
