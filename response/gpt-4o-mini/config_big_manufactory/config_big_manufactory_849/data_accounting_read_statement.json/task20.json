The line items we are looking for include \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" as it represents the cost associated with the inventory that was sold during the period.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items:**\n   - The main candidates for indicating the cost of inventories sold are \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) and \"Total Cost.\" In accounting terms, COGS will give us the expense related to the inventory sold.\n\n2. **Locate COGS in the Statement:**\n   - From the provided data, we can see the following relevant line:\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold**: 11600000.00\n\n3. **Because the Cost of Goods Sold includes the carrying amount of inventories sold:**\n   - The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is thus equal to the COGS.\n\nFollowing these steps, we conclude that the carrying amount of inventories sold (the value we need to present) is 11600000.00.\n\nNow to format the answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '11600000.00'} }\n```",
