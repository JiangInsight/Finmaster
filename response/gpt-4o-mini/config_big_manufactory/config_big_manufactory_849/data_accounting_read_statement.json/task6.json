Since both inventory and fixed assets are involved, we look at their final values:\n\n- **Final tangible asset value**: \n  - Total tangible assets = Fixed Assets (end value) + Inventory (end value)\n  - Total tangible assets = 9726015.08 + 5600000.00 = 15326015.08\n\nWe will put together this information into the required JSON format to indicate the initial and end values of tangible items:\n\n- **Initial Value**: 8000000.00 (from Fixed Assets)\n- **End Value**: 9726015.08 (from Fixed Assets)\n\nHowever, since inventory also contributes significantly to the total tangible asset section, we include the total tangible assets in the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '15326015.08'}}\n```",
