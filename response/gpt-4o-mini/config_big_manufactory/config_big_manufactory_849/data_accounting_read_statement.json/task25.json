In this case, it is **11,600,000.00**.\n   - **Selling Expenses**: This represents the costs incurred in the selling and distribution of goods. Here, it is **1,334,099.97**.\n\n3. **Total the Relevant Costs**: \n   - We will sum the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Selling Expenses to present a complete picture of the costs associated with securing and delivering customer orders.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Costs} = \\text{Cost of Goods Sold} + \\text{Selling Expenses} = 11,600,000.00 + 1,334,099.97 = 12,934,099.97\n   \\]\n\n4. **Prepare the Output**: The total value calculated from the relevant line items will be formatted according to the requested JSON structure.\n\nNow composing the final result, we find that the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services is **12,934,099.97**. \n\nThus the final JSON output should be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '12934099.97'}}\n```",
