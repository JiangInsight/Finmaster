We need to find **current liabilities** which typically includes:\n   - **Accounts Payable**\n   - **Taxes Payable**\n   - Any other current liabilities (In this case, we can see there is a total that aggregates these current liabilities).\n\n2. From the balance sheet provided, here's what I can see:\n   - **Accounts Payable**: \n     - Initial Amount: 0.00 \n     - End Amount: 3,500,000.00\n   - **Taxes Payable**: \n     - Initial Amount: 0.00\n     - End Amount: 819,436.82\n   - **Total Current Liabilities**:\n     - Initial Amount: 0.00 \n     - End Amount: 4,319,436.82\n\n3. The **initial value** of total current liabilities is recorded as 0.00 in the balance sheet for the starting date (2023-12-31). \n\n4. The **final value** of total current liabilities recorded in the balance sheet for the ending date (2024-02-05) is 4,319,436.82.\n\nNow, I can summarize the findings in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '4319436.82'} }\n```",
