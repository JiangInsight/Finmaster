In the income statement, the entry for COGS is noted as 11,600,000.00. This reflects the costs directly associated with producing or delivering the products sold.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses**: These are expenses that go towards the selling and delivery of goods and possibly securing customer orders. The entry for selling expenses is noted as 1,334,099.97. This would include costs such as advertising, promotions, and other selling activities that help in securing customer orders and delivering products.\n\nTo summarize our findings:\n\n- From the income statement:\n  - Cost of Goods Sold: 11,600,000.00\n  - Selling Expenses: 1,334,099.97\n\n**Total Costs to Secure and Deliver Goods**: \nThis would usually be considered as including both COGS and selling expenses together if we're representing all related costs:\n\n11,600,000.00 (COGS) + 1,334,099.97 (Selling Expenses) = 12,934,099.97.\n\nHowever, if the task specifies extracting one specific line item, the **Selling Expenses** of 1,334,099.97 could be highlighted as a specific cost incurred to secure customer orders (not including the broader context of COGS).\n\nGiven the requirement to focus on specific incurred costs related to securing orders:\n\nTherefore, the solution based on extracting the specific line item of selling expenses incurred to secure customer orders is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1334099.97'} }\n```",
