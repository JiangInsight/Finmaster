However, it does not show any direct indication of inventory sold.\n\n2. **Review the Cash Flow Statement:**\n   - The cash flow statement has a line indicating \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" showing a cost of -5,600,000.00. This implies that the inventory decreased by this amount during the reporting period, which can indicate that the inventories were sold.\n\n3. **Examine the Income Statement:**\n   - The income statement includes a \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item with an amount of 11,600,000.00 as of 2024-02-05. This represents the cost of the inventories that were sold during the reporting period.\n\nPutting all this together, the relevant value for the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period can be taken from the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line on the income statement:\n\n**Final Identification:**\n- **Carrying amount of inventories sold**: 11,600,000.00\n\nNow, I will format the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '11600000.00'} }\n```",
