From the provided cash flow statement, we see the following entries under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\":\n   - **Net Profit:** 1290835.16 (2024-02-05)\n\n2. This line item, \"Net Profit,\" represents the profit after deducting operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, and other expenses from total revenue. \n\n3. The amount associated with \"Net Profit\" is 1290835.16.\n\n4. We will proceed to format this outcome into the required JSON structure as per the instruction.\n\nNow, compiling the above reasoning, we conclude:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1290835.16'} }\n```",
