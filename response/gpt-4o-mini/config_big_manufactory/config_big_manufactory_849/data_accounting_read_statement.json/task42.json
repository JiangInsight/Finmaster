This section typically details all cash inflows and outflows related to investments in long-term assets.\n\nLet's break down the provided cash flow statement step by step:\n\n1. Locate the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section:\n   ```\n   | Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n   ```\n\n2. Identify the specific line item that pertains to the acquisition of long-term assets like property and equipment:\n   ```\n   | Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 1726015.08 | 2024-02-05 |\n   ```\n\n3. The line item \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" indicates the cash outflow used for acquiring property, plant, and equipment.\n\n4. The amount associated with this line item is **1726015.08**.\n\nSince this is the only line item related to cash payments for acquiring PPE in the provided cash flow statement, we can summarize our findings.\n\nThus, the extracted value for the cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment is **1726015.08**.\n\nNow let's format this in the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1726015.08'} }\n```",
