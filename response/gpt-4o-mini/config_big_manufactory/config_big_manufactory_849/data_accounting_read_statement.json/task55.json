This represents the amount of tax the company owes at the end of the reporting period.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - The cash flow statement indicates changes in tax payable, specifically: \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" which is 819436.82 for the period. This shows that the tax payable has increased by this amount.\n\n3. **Income Statement**:\n   - The income statement shows a line item \"Tax Expense\" amounting to 819436.82. This represents the tax expense recognized for the period ending 2024-02-05.\n\nFrom these pieces of information, both the income statement's \"Tax Expense\" and the balance sheet's \"Taxes Payable\" indicate that the expected amount of tax to be paid or recovered during this reporting period is 819436.82.\n\nThus, the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '819436.82'} }\n```",
