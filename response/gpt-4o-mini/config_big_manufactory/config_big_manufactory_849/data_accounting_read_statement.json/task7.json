However, we can look at specific accounts that might relate to expenses, especially accumulated depreciation because it often reflects a type of expense related to the usage of fixed assets.\n\n1. **Identifying Relevant Line Item**: The line item \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is the only candidate here for being reflective of an expense over time.\n\n2. **Initial and Final Values**:\n   - The **initial amount** for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is 0.00\n   - The **end amount** for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" is 105,893.32 \n\n3. **Formulating the Output**: Based on the valid expense identified, we can compile the values into the requested JSON format.\n\nNow, let's put the identified values in the solution format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '105893.32'} }\n```",
