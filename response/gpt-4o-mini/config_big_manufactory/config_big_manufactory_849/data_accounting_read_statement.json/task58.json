Thus, the value captured under \"Beginning Balance\" corresponds to this definition.\n\n3. **Final Extraction**:\n   The value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is determined to be **20000000.00**.\n\nFinally, we format our solution as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20000000.00'} }\n```",
