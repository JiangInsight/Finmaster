The costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers (typically found as 'Cost of Goods Sold' in the income statement).\n2. The cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets (found as 'Purchase of Fixed Assets' in the cash flow statement).\n\n### Step 2: Review Each Financial Statement\n\n#### Balance Sheet\n- No relevant line items here for this task.\n\n#### Income Statement\n- The relevant line item is:\n  - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** 11600000.00\n\n#### Cash Flow Statement\n- The relevant line item is:\n  - **Purchase of Fixed Assets:** 1726015.08\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Output\nNow that we have identified the relevant costs:\n- **value1 (Cost of Goods Sold):** 11600000.00\n- **value2 (Purchase of Fixed Assets):** 1726015.08\n\nWe will format the solution in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '11600000.00', 'value2': '1726015.08'}}\n```",
