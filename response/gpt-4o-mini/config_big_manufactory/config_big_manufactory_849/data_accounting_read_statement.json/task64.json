The three specific line items to extract are:\n\n1. **Profit Before Tax** (which represents profit or loss for the period before deducting tax expense).\n2. **Addition in Amount Owed by the Entity for Goods or Services Purchased on Credit** (which corresponds to the change in Accounts Payable).\n3. **Capital Contributed by Shareholders in Exchange for Shares** (which corresponds to the Paid-in Capital).\n\nNow, let's extract these values step by step from the provided financial statements.\n\n### Balance Sheet\nFrom the balance sheet information, we identify:\n- **Paid-in Capital**: This is the capital contributed by shareholders, which is **28000000.00**.\n\n### Income Statement\nFrom the income statement, we find:\n- **Profit Before Tax**: The value listed is **2110271.98**.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\nFrom the cash flow statement, we identify the increase in accounts payable as the addition in the amount owed:\n- **Increase in Accounts Payable**: This value is **3500000.00**.\n\nNow, we will organize the extracted values according to the group order requested.\n\n### Summary of Extracted Values\n- **Paid-in Capital** (from Balance Sheet): **28000000.00**\n- **Profit Before Tax** (from Income Statement): **2110271.98**\n- **Increase in Accounts Payable** (from Cash Flow Statement): **3500000.00**\n\n### Final Solution Formatting\nWith our extracted values, we need to structure them into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '2110271.98', 'value3': '3500000.00'} }\n```\n\nThis summarizes our findings accurately based on the financial statements provided.",
