The line item that represents the profit an entity retains after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, have been deducted from total revenue. This line item is labeled as \"Net Profit\".\n\n2. The line item that represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. This line item is typically labeled as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\nLet's extract these two values from the cash flow statement:\n\nFrom the provided cash flow statement:\n\n- The \"Net Profit\" line item is:\n  - Net Profit  | 1290835.16 | 2024-02-05\n  - Thus, the amount for Net Profit is **1290835.16**.\n\n- The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item is:\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 1726015.08 | 2024-02-05\n  - Thus, the amount for Purchase of Fixed Assets is **1726015.08**.\n\nNow, we organize these values in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1290835.16', 'value2': '1726015.08'} }\n```",
