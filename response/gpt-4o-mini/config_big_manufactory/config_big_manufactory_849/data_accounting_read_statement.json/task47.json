Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:\n   - From the provided cash flow statement, the line \"Net Increase\" indicates the change in cash and cash equivalents during the period. The value is `-8042420.52`.\n\n2. **Determine the Beginning and Ending Balances**:\n   - The \"Beginning Balance\" of cash and cash equivalents is noted as `20000000.00`.\n   - The \"Ending Balance\" of cash and cash equivalents is given as `11957579.48`.\n\n3. **Decompose the Net Increase**:\n   - The net increase can be understood as a calculation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Increase} = \\text{Ending Balance} - \\text{Beginning Balance} \n     \\]\n   - Here, we can see that the net change in cash and cash equivalents is:\n     \\[\n     -8042420.52 = 11957579.48 - 20000000.00\n     \\]\n   - This calculation confirms the net addition.\n\n4. **Prepare the Final Output**:\n   - We will now format our answer according to the required JSON structure.\n\nThe final answer would then be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-8042420.52', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '20000000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '11957579.48'} }\n```",
