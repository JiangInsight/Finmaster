In the statement, this is represented by \"Selling Expenses\".\n   - **Value:** 1334099.97\n\n2. **Financing costs incurred to raise funds for production and operation:** This refers to financial expenses. In the statement, this is represented by \"Financial Expenses\".\n   - **Value:** 523627.32\n\n3. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life:** This is represented by \"Depreciation\" in the income statement.\n   - **Value:** 105893.32\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period:** This is represented by \"Tax Expense\".\n   - **Value:** 819436.82\n\nSo, the values extracted for each of the line items in the specified order are as follows:\n- Selling Expenses → 1334099.97\n- Depreciation → 105893.32\n- Financial Expenses → 523627.32\n- Tax Expense → 819436.82\n\nNow, we can place these values into our solution format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1334099.97', 'value2': '105893.32', 'value3': '523627.32', 'value4': '819436.82'} }\n```",
