Tangible items for production, supply, rental, or administrative purposes\n3. Amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid\n\nFrom the input balance sheet:\n\n- **Cash on Hand**: This refers to cash available for day-to-day operations.\n- **Bank Deposits**: This also refers to cash available for operations (but typically in bank accounts).\n- **Inventory**: This is a tangible item that is held for the production and supply of goods.\n- **Taxes Payable**: This reflects the amount of tax that has accrued but has not yet been paid.\n\nWe will extract the initial and end values for each of these line items from the balance sheet.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Each Relevant Line Item\n\n1. **Cash on Hand**\n   - Initial Amount: 5000000.00\n   - End Amount: 9383594.56\n\n2. **Fixed Assets**: In this context, we're particularly focused on inventory and tangible assets.\n   - Note: Although the problem may require assets like inventory, fixed assets are, generally speaking, also tangible. In our specific extraction, we will choose `Inventory`, as it fits the described use case.\n   - Initial Amount: 0.00  (but it only shows value at end)\n   - End Amount: 5600000.00\n\n3. **Taxes Payable**: This represents the accrued taxes that are not yet paid.\n   - Initial Amount: 0.00 (as the tax was not previously deferred)\n   - End Amount: 819436.82\n  \n### Step 2: Prepare the Output\n\nNow we structure the resulting findings in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '5000000.00', 'end valu1': '9383594.56', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '5600000.00', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '819436.82'}}\n```\n\nThe \"solution\" object correctly maintains the order as requested and includes both the initial and end amounts for each of the identified line items.",
