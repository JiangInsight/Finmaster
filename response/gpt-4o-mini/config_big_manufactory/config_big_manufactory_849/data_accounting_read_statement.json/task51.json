This aligns with the end amount reported on the balance sheet as \"Interest Receivable.\"\n\nNow, we put together the initial and end values for \"Interest Receivable\":\n- **Initial Value**: 0.00\n- **End Value**: 23583.67\n\nFinally, we format the answer as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '23583.67'}}\n```",
