                        "content": "To calculate the required financial ratios, I will follow a step-by-step approach and use the relevant figures from the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets. It is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\nIn this case:\n- Given that Total Revenue for the period is 28,572,608.70, we can assume this amount represents net credit sales.\n- Accounts Receivable at the end is 14,921,566.06. Since there's no initial amount to consider, the average will be the same as the end amount.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{28572608.70}{14921566.06} \\approx 1.91 \n\\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio indicates how well a company can cover its current liabilities with its operating cash flow.\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nFrom cash flow and balance sheet data:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10,442,735.47\n- Total Current Liabilities = 8,028,630.43\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{-10442735.47}{8028630.43} \\approx -1.30 \n\\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nSimilar to the previous ratio, it shows how much cash is generated from operations relative to liabilities.\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nUsing the same numbers:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-10442735.47}{8028630.43} \\approx -1.30 \n\\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures the efficiency of a company in using its assets to generate sales.\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n\\]\nAssuming average total assets are the start and end totals:\n- Total Assets Start = 28,000,000.00\n- Total Assets End = 39,772,748.32\n\nAverage total assets:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{28000000 + 39772748.32}{2} = 33886374.16 \n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{28572608.70}{33886374.16} \\approx 0.84 \n\\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio indicates the proportion of equity and debt a company uses to finance its assets. \n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n\\]\nTotal Liabilities from the balance sheet is composed of Total Current Liabilities, equaling 8,028,630.43. \n\nCalculating:\n- Total Owner's Equity = 31,744,117.89\n\nNow substituting into the ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{8028630.43}{31744117.89} \\approx 0.25 \n\\]\n\n### Final Results\nNow consolidating all calculated values:\n\n1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio: **1.91**\n2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio: **-1.30**\n3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio: **-1.30**\n4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio: **0.84**\n5. Debt to Equity Ratio: **0.25**\n\n### Present the answer in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '1.91', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.30', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.30', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.84', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.25'} }\n```",
