                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: From the cash flow statement, the net cash flow from operating activities is given as -10,442,735.47.\n\n2. **Determine Total Debt**: From the balance sheet, we need to determine the total liabilities. The relevant accounts under liabilities are:\n   - Accounts Payable: 6,600,000.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 1,428,630.43\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 8,028,630.43 (this is the total of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable)\n\nThus, the total debt is \\( 8,028,630.43 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This ratio is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the values we obtained:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = -1.3045796923237009 \\approx -1.30\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we can present the result in the required JSON format.\n\nHereâ€™s the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.30'} }\n```",
