                        "content": "To solve for the various financial ratios based on the provided financial statements, we'll methodically calculate each as outlined below.\n\n### 1. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**\nThis ratio measures how well a company can cover its current liabilities with its operating cash flow.\n\n- **Operating Cash Flow (OCF)**: From cash flow statement, OCF is given as **-10442735.47**.\n- **Current Liabilities**: From the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities is **8028630.43**.\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{-10442735.47}{8028630.43} \\approx -1.30 \n\\]\n\n### 2. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\nThis ratio indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets.\n\n- **Total Liabilities**: Total Current Liabilities is **8028630.43**.\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: From the balance sheet, Total Owner's Equity is **31744117.89**.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Equity}} = \\frac{8028630.43}{31744117.89} \\approx 0.25\n\\]\n\n### 3. **Total Asset Turnover Ratio**\nThis ratio measures the efficiency of a company's use of its assets in generating sales revenue.\n\n- **Total Revenue**: Total Revenue from income statement is **28572608.70**.\n- **Total Assets**: From the balance sheet, Total Assets is **39772748.32**.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{28572608.70}{39772748.32} \\approx 0.72\n\\]\n\n### 4. **Quick Ratio**\nThis ratio measures a companyâ€™s ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n\nTo calculate the Quick Ratio, we need:\n- **Current Assets**: Total Current Assets is **29413723.95**.\n- **Current Liabilities**: Total Current Liabilities is **8028630.43**.\n- **Inventory**: From the balance sheet, Inventory is **7400000.00**.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{29413723.95 - 7400000.00}{8028630.43} \\approx 2.79\n\\]\n\n### 5. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\nThis ratio measures the ability to cover current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{-10442735.47}{8028630.43} \\approx -1.30\n\\]\n\n### 6. **Return on Equity (ROE)**\nThis ratio measures the ability of a firm to generate profits from its shareholders' investments.\n\n- **Net Profit**: From income statement, Net Profit is **3744117.89**.\n- **Total Owner's Equity**: Total Owner's Equity from balance sheet is **31744117.89**.\n\n\\[\n\\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Owner's Equity}} = \\frac{3744117.89}{31744117.89} \\approx 0.12 \\text{ (or 12.00%)} \n\\]\n\n### 7. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company collects on its receivables.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\nAssuming Accounts Receivable at the beginning of the period was zero:\n\n- **Average Accounts Receivable**: Accounts Receivable in the end is **14921566.06**.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{28572608.70}{14921566.06} \\approx 1.92\n\\]\n\n### Final Results\nNow, compiling these calculated values into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-1.30\", \n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.25\", \n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.72\", \n    \"Quick Ratio\": \"2.79\", \n    \"Operating Cash Flow Ratio\": \"-1.30\", \n    \"Return on Equity (ROE)\": \"12.00%\", \n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"1.92\"\n}}\n``` \n\nThese results are based on the calculations performed step by step from the provided financial statements.",
