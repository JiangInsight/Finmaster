                        "content": "To solve the problem, we'll perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   - First, we need to find Total Liabilities and Total Assets from the balance sheet.\n   - From the balance sheet, Total Liabilities (total current liabilities) are provided as:\n     - Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 6600000.00 + 1428630.43 = 8028630.43\n   - Total Assets are provided as:\n     - Total Assets = 39772748.32\n   - Now, we can calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{8028630.43}{39772748.32}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - We take Gross Profit from the income statement and Total Revenue for the calculation.\n   - Gross Profit = 8372608.70\n   - Total Revenue = 28572608.70\n   - The formula for Gross Profit Margin is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - The Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated using the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities and Total Current Liabilities.\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10442735.47\n   - Using Total Current Liabilities = 8028630.43 (as calculated before).\n   - The formula for Operating Cash Flow Ratio is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n\nLet's do the calculations step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Debt to Asset Ratio\n- Total Liabilities = 8028630.43\n- Total Assets = 39772748.32\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{8028630.43}{39772748.32} \\approx 0.201\n\\]\n- For precision, we will round it to two decimal places later.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Gross Profit Margin\n- Gross Profit = 8372608.70\n- Total Revenue = 28572608.70\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{8372608.70}{28572608.70} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 29.30\\%\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -10442735.47\n- Total Current Liabilities = 8028630.43\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-10442735.47}{8028630.43} \\approx -1.30\n\\]\n\n### Final Values\nNow we can round and put everything into the required JSON format. Here are the finalized answers to the calculations:\n\n- Debt to Asset Ratio: approximately **0.20** (we will keep two decimal points).\n- Gross Profit Margin: approximately **29.30%**.\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: approximately **-1.30**.\n\nNow, we can summarize that in the required output form:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.20', 'Gross Profit Margin': '29.30%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-1.30'}}\n```",
