We will use this in our calculations.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Current Liabilities from Balance Sheet\nFrom the balance sheet provided, we'll focus on the following:\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: 8,028,630.43\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nNow we have:\n- Operating Cash Flow (OCF) = -10,442,735.47\n- Current Liabilities (CL) = 8,028,630.43\n\nThe formula for calculating the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nCalculating this ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-10,442,735.47}{8,028,630.43} \\approx -1.30\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nNow we can present the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.30'}}\n```",
