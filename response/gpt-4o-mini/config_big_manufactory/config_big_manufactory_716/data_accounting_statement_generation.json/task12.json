Purchase20231231002 - Amount: 1,000,000.0\n2. Purchase20231231010 - Amount: 500,000.0\n3. Purchase20231231012 - Amount: 800,000.0\n4. Purchase20231231018 - Amount: 1,500,000.0\n\n### Step 2: Initial Accounts Payable\nThe initial accounts payable are assumed to be zero. However, since we are considering only the transactions where the purchase was done but not paid, we classify the unpaid purchases as part of accounts payable.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Unpaid Amounts\nWe will sum the amounts of the purchases flagged as unpaid:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Unpaid} = 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 800,000 + 1,500,000 = 2,800,000\n\\]\n\nThus, the initial accounts payable amount is 0.00, and the final accounts payable amount is the total unpaid purchases, which is 2,800,000. \n\n### Step 4: Formulating the Result in the Required Format\nNow we'll format the solution into the requested JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '2800000.00'}}\n``` \n\nThis output reflects the accounts payable at the beginning and end of the reporting period per the data provided.",
