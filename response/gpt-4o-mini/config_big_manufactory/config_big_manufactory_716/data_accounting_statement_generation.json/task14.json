Based on the provided data, we will begin by examining the details of each transaction to derive the total current liabilities at both the beginning and end of the period.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Unpaid Purchases**:\n   - An \"Unpaid\" status in the purchase transactions indicates there is a current liability.\n   - We will sum up the amounts associated with these unpaid purchases for both the initial and final values.\n\n2. **Initial Values**: \n   - As the transactions were primarily dated from 2023-12-31 onward, we will look specifically for unpaid transactions listed before any 2024 entries.\n\n3. **Final Values**:\n   - Total the unpaid liabilities at the end of the period based on the transactions.\n\n### Transactions Breakdown:\n\n#### Initial Liabilities (As of 2023-12-31)\n- From the data:\n  - **Purchase20231231002**: Amount: **1,000,000.0** (Unpaid)\n  - **Purchase20231231008**: Amount: **1,000,000.0** (Unpaid)\n  - **Purchase20231231012**: Amount: **1,600,000.0** (Unpaid)\n  - **Purchase20231231015**: Amount: **2,000,000.0** (Unpaid)\n\n#### Total Initial Current Liabilities\n- The sum will be:\n  - **1,000,000.0** + **1,000,000.0** + **1,600,000.0** + **2,000,000.0** \n  - Total Initial Liabilities = **5,600,000.0**\n\n#### Additional Metrics (End of Period)\nThe next step involves analyzing currents liabilities incurred in 2024.\n\n#### Final Liabilities:\n- Now looking for unpaid purchases from the 2024 transactions:\n  - **Purchase20240121012**: Amount: **1,500,000.0** (Unpaid)\n  - **Purchase20240122013**: Amount: **1,000,000.0** (Unpaid)\n  - **Purchase20240125010**: Amount: **1,000,000.0** (Unpaid)\n\n#### Total Final Current Liabilities\n- The sum will be:\n  - **1,500,000.0** + **1,000,000.0** + **1,000,000.0**\n  - Total Final Liabilities = **3,500,000.0**\n\n### Final Output\n\nAfter summing up the identified unpaid liabilities for both the initial and final situation, we can structure the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '5600000.0', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '3500000.0'}}\n```",
