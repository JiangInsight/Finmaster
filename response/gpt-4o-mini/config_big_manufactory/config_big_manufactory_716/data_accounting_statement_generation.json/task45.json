In this case, the relevant transactions are purchases and sales of fixed assets, as well as any capital expenditures.\n\nLet's analyze the data step by step:\n\n1. **Identify transactions related to investing activities:**\n   - Fixed assets purchases and their related costs.\n   - Sales of fixed assets.\n\n2. **Determine amounts:**\n   - All amounts in the `amount` column will be taken into account for inflows (sales of assets) as positive and outflows (purchases of assets) as negative.\n\nNow looking through the provided data, we will sum up the relevant transactions as follows:\n\n### Finding Cash Flows from Investing Activities:\n- **Purchases**:\n  - Purchase for Fixed Assets: **-7,584,493.61** (line with amount: **758493.61** is a fixed asset purchase).\n  - Purchase for Heavy Equipment C: **-1,000,000.0** (line with amount: **1000000.0**).\n  - Purchase for Heavy Equipment C: **-1,500,000.0** (line with amount: **1500000.0**).\n  - Purchase for Heavy Equipment D: **-3,000,000.0** (line with amount: **3000000.0**).\n  - Purchase for Heavy Equipment A: **-1,000,000.0** (line with amount: **1000000.0** is both a purchase and sale).\n\n- **Sales**:\n  - Sale of Heavy Equipment C: **1,411,983.38** (amount on the sale line).\n  - Sale of Heavy Equipment B: **1,084,638.38** (amount from the next sale line).\n  - Sale of Heavy Equipment D: **2,198,484.30** (amount from the last heavy equipment sale line).\n  - Sale for Heavy Equipment A: **720,191.63** (amount for the Heavy Equipment A sale).\n\n### Calculating the Total:\nNow, letâ€™s sum all the inflows and outflows:\n\n- **Total Cash Inflows from Sales**:\n  \\[\n  1411983.38 + 1064438.17 + 2183357.44 + 721719.53 + 720191.63 + 799798.73 = 7356200.15\n  \\]\n\n- **Total Cash Outflows from Purchases**:\n  \\[\n  -758493.61 - 1000000.0 - 1500000.0 - 3000000.0 - 1000000.0 = - 1028493.61 \n  \\]\n\n### Net Cash Flow Calculation:\n\\[\nNet Cash Flow from Investing Activities = Total Cash Inflows - Total Cash Outflows\n\\]\n\\[\n= 7356200.15 - 1028493.61 = 6327706.54\n\\]\n\n### Presenting the final net cash flows in the specified format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '6327706.54'} }\n```",
