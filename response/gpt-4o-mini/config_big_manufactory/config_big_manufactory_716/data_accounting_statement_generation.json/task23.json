                        "content": "To calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) from the provided data, we need to focus on the purchase and sale transactions that relate directly to the inventory of goods sold. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n### Step 1: Identify relevant transactions\n1. **Sales Transactions**: These represent the revenue generated from the sales of products.\n2. **Purchases Transactions**: These represent the goods that were acquired for sale and need to be accounted for in COGS.\n3. **The COGS is calculated based on the purchase amounts of inventory that were sold during the period.**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nWe will sum the cost amounts of the purchase transactions related to the products sold through the sale transactions.\n\n1. **Sales**:\n   - Sale on 2024-01-03: 1 Heavy Equipment C sold for `1000000.0`\n   - Sale on 2024-01-06: 1 Heavy Equipment B sold for `800000.0`\n   - Sale on 2024-01-09: 1 Heavy Equipment B sold for `800000.0`\n   - Sale on 2024-01-10: 1 Heavy Equipment B sold for `800000.0`\n   - Sale on 2024-01-13: 1 Heavy Equipment D sold for `1500000.0`\n   - Sale on 2024-01-18: 1 Heavy Equipment B sold for `800000.0`\n   - Sale on 2024-01-19: 1 Heavy Equipment D sold for `1500000.0`\n   - Sale on 2024-01-20: 1 Heavy Equipment A sold for `500000`\n   - Sale on 2024-01-21: 1 Heavy Equipment D sold for `1500000.0`\n   - Sale on 2024-01-22: 1 Heavy Equipment B sold for `1000000.0`\n\n2. **Purchase Amounts** that correspond to sold products:\n   - Purchase Heavy Equipment C (1 unit for `1000000`).\n   - Purchase Heavy Equipment B (3 units totaling `2400000` for 3 units sold).\n   - Purchase Heavy Equipment D (3 units totaling `4500000` for 3 units sold).\n   - Purchase Heavy Equipment A (500000.0 for 1 unit sold).\n\n### Step 3: Sum up COGS\nTotal COGS comprises the purchase costs of each item sold:\n- Heavy Equipment C: `1000000`\n- Heavy Equipment B (4 units sold, but only include 3 since 1 is already accounted for, total purchase cost of one unit): `2400000`\n- Heavy Equipment D (2 units of `1500000`): `3000000`\n- Heavy Equipment A: `500000`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total COGS\n- **Total COGS**\n  ```\n  COGS = Purchase Cost Heavy Equipment C + Purchase Cost Heavy Equipment B + Purchase Cost Heavy Equipment D + Purchase Cost Heavy Equipment A\n       = 1000000 + 2400000 + 3000000 + 500000\n       = 6900000\n  ```\n\n### Final Output\nContinuing in the required output format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '6900000.00'} }\n```",
