                        "content": "To calculate the net increase in cash and cash equivalents based on the provided transactions, we categorize the transactions into cash inflows and cash outflows.\n\n1. **Identify Cash Inflows:**\n    - These include:\n      - Cash deposits\n      - Sales (where cash is received)\n      - Bank transfers to cash\n      - Interest received\n\n2. **Identify Cash Outflows:**\n    - These include:\n      - All types of expenses\n      - Purchases made (if paid through cash or account payable)\n      - Fixed asset purchases (if paid with cash or through bank transfer)\n      - Any transfers from cash to bank can be considered as cash outflows\n\nNext, letâ€™s summarize both inflows and outflows based on the provided data:\n\n### Cash Inflows:\n- Cash deposit: 5,000,000.00\n- Bank deposit: 15,000,000.00\n- Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n- Sale (Unpaid): 1,411,983.38\n- Sale (Unpaid): 1,081,640.66\n- Sale (Paid): 1,191,073.63\n- Sale (Paid): 2,017,131.08\n- Sale (Paid): 2,012,132.85\n- Sale (Paid): 2,206,073.45\n- Sale (Paid): 2,185,119.93\n- Sale (Paid): 1,451,453.32\n- Any transfers from bank recognized as inflows.\n\n### Cash Outflows:\n- Purchase: 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase: 1,000,000.00\n- Purchase: 1,500,000.00\n- Each time expenses: 1,041,200.05 (Accumulate all)\n- Purchase transaction: account payable (Unpaid) is accounted outflow.\n- Transfers out of cash: total 5,000,000.00.\n\n### Calculate Total Inflows and Outflows:\nNow, we will summarize outflows and inflows:\n\n1. **Total Cash Inflows:**\n   - Direct cash deposits and bank deposits:  \n     \\( 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 + 1411983.38 + 1081640.66 + 1191073.63 + 2017131.08 + 2012132.85 + 2206073.45 + 2185119.93 + 1451453.32 = 45,678,062.92 \\)\n\n2. **Total Cash Outflows:**  \n   - Sum of each purchase and accumulated expenses outflow. (including asset purchases):\n   \\( 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 1041200 + 5000000 (transfers) = 8,920,200.00 \\)\n\nFinally, we determine the net cash inflow\\, by subtracting total outflows from total inflows:\n\n### Net Increase Calculation:\n- Net Increase = Total Cash Inflows - Total Cash Outflows  \n  \\( Net Increase = 45,678,062.92 - 8,920,200.00 = 36,757,862.92 \\)\n\n### Final Output in Required Format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Increase': '36757862.92'}}\n```",
