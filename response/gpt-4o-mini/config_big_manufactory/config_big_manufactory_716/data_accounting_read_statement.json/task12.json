Current assets typically include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, and other assets that are expected to be converted into cash within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Current Assets Breakdown**:\n   - Cash on Hand: 5,000,000.00 (Initial) -> 6,057,264.53 (End)\n   - Bank Deposits: 15,000,000.00 (Initial) -> 1,020,005.47 (End)\n   - Interest Receivable: 0.00 (Initial) -> 14,887.89 (End)\n   - Accounts Receivable: 0.00 (Initial) -> 14,921,566.06 (End)\n   - Inventory: 0.00 (Initial) -> 7,400,000.00 (End)\n\n2. **Total Current Assets**:\n   - Initial Total Current Assets: 20,000,000.00\n   - End Total Current Assets: 29,413,723.95\n\n3. **Identifying Initial and Final Values**:\n   - The initial value of total current assets is the sum of the starting amounts:\n     - **Initial Value**: 5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 + 0.00 + 0.00 + 0.00 = 20,000,000.00\n   - The final value of total current assets is the sum of the ending amount:\n     - **End Value**: 6,057,264.53 + 1,020,005.47 + 14,887.89 + 14,921,566.06 + 7,400,000.00 = 29,413,723.95\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe total initial value and final value of assets that are expected to be realized or consumed in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle are as follows:\n- **Initial Value**: 20,000,000.00\n- **End Value**: 29,413,723.95\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '20000000.00', 'end value': '29413723.95'}}\n```",
