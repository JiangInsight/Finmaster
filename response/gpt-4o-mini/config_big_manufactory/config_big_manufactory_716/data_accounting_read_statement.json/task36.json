We start with the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section. Within this section, we look for the line item named \"Net Profit\" since this represents the profit retained after all expenses have been deducted.\n\n2. In this specific cash flow statement, we find:\n   - **Net Profit  | 3744117.89 | 2024-02-05**\n\n3. The value of \"Net Profit\" is given as **3744117.89**. This amount is what the entity retains after accounting for all operating costs, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nHaving identified this, we can now present the solution using the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3744117.89'} }\n```",
