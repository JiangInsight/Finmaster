In an income statement, the primary cost related to securing orders and delivering goods/services is typically represented under **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**. This is the direct cost attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company.\n\n2. There might also be relevant expenses related to selling activities which help in securing those orders. Such expenses usually fall under **Selling Expenses**.\n\n3. Reviewing the provided income statement:\n\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold** (COGS): 20200000.00\n   - **Selling Expenses**: 1177105.26\n\n4. We need to sum these amounts to get the total cost incurred to secure customer orders and deliver the related goods and services.\n\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: 20200000.00\n   - Selling Expenses: 1177105.26\n\n5. Adding these two line items gives:\n   - Total Relevant Costs = COGS + Selling Expenses = 20200000.00 + 1177105.26 = 21317105.26\n\nBased on the task requirement, we need to present this in the designated JSON format. \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '21317105.26'} }\n```",
