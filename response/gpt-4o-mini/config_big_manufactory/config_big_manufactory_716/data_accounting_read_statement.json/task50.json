Let's identify each of them step by step:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This corresponds to the **Depreciation** line item.\n   - From the input: \n     - Depreciation: `120970.16`\n\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale**: This line typically refers to the **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**, which represents the reduction in assets held for sale.\n   - From the input:\n     - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: `-7400000.00`\n\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from acquisition and disposal of long-term assets**: This corresponds to the **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities** line.\n   - From the input:\n     - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: `-2479994.53`\n\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This corresponds to the **Net Increase** line item.\n   - From the input:\n     - Net Increase: `-12922730.00`\n\nNow, we will compile all the extracted values we identified into the final JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '120970.16', 'value2': '-7400000.00', 'value3': '-2479994.53', 'value4': '-12922730.00'} }\n```",
