Balance Sheet:\nFrom the balance sheet, we look for \"Interest Receivable,\" which represents the interest accrued but not yet received.\n- **Interest Receivable**: End_amount = **14887.89**\n\n### 2. Income Statement:\nFrom the income statement, the relevant line item is \"Interest Income,\" which also reflects the amount of interest accrued but not yet received.\n- **Interest Income**: Amount = **14887.89**\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement:\nFrom the cash flow statement, we need to find the \"Net Increase\" in \"Cash and Cash Equivalents.\"\n- **Net Increase**: Amount = **-12922730.00**\n\nNow, we will compile the extracted values into the required output format. \n\nFor the two line items related to interest accrued but not yet received, we see that both figures correspond to **14887.89**. We only need to present it once as the interest can be interpreted from both the balance sheet and income statement perspective. \n\nSo, let's organize the final values for the output:\n\n- Value for interest accrued but not yet received: **14887.89**\n- Value for net addition in cash and cash equivalents: **-12922730.00**\n\nThus, we can now present our answer in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14887.89', 'value2': '-12922730.00'} }\n```",
