However, for the carrying amount of inventories sold, we are more interested in the cost of goods sold (COGS).\n\n2. **Income Statement Analysis**: The income statement directly provides the cost of goods sold (COGS) amount, which represents the inventory that has been sold during the reporting period.\n\nLooking at the income statement provided:\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 20200000.00\n\nThis amount directly corresponds to the carrying amount of inventories that were sold during the reporting period.\n\nFinally, we format the answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20200000.00'} }\n```",
