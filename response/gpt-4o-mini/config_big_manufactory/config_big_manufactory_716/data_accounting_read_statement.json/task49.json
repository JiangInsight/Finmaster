The value of the addition in Accounts Payable (which represents the increase in amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period).\n2. The acquisition of property, plant, and equipment (listed as Purchase of Fixed Assets).\n3. The cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\nLet's analyze the provided cash flow statement step by step:\n\n1. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: The amount listed here is **6600000.00**. This represents the addition in accounts payable indicating the amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The amount listed here is **2479994.53**. This indicates the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment during the period.\n\n3. **Beginning Balance**: The amount listed under Cash and Cash Equivalents at the beginning of the period is **20000000.00**.\n\nOnce we have identified these amounts, the final values to be recorded in the solution are:\n- For Accounts Payable: **6600000.00**\n- For Purchase of Fixed Assets: **2479994.53**\n- For Beginning Cash and Cash Equivalents: **20000000.00**\n\nNow, we will format the extracted values in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6600000.00', 'value2': '2479994.53', 'value3': '20000000.00'} }\n```",
