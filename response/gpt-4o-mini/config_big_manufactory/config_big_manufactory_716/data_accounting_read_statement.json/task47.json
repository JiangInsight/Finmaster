                        "content": "To solve the problem step by step, we need to identify the net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the given period along with the relevant financial data involved in the calculation. We focus on the 'Net Increase' item under 'Cash and Cash Equivalents' as the main line item representing the net addition. This item calculates the difference between the beginning balance and the ending balance of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Key Line Items\nFrom the provided cash flow statement, we can gather the following key information:\n\n1. **Beginning Balance** of Cash and Cash Equivalents:  \n   **Value**: 20000000.00\n\n2. **Ending Balance** of Cash and Cash Equivalents:  \n   **Value**: 7077270.00\n\n3. **Net Increase** in Cash and Cash Equivalents:  \n   **Value**: -12922730.00\n\nThis Net Increase represents the change in cash and cash equivalents over the period.\n\n### Step 2: Decomposing the Net Increase\nTo dissect the net increase into two components, we can ascertain what contributes to the overall change in cash flow, mainly focusing on:\n\n- **Beginning Balance**: Represents the cash available at the start of the period.\n- **Ending Balance**: Represents the cash available at the conclusion of the period.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Output\nBased on the information we've identified, we can formulate our output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-12922730.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '20000000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '7077270.00'}}\n```\n\nThis output includes the net increase value along with the beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents, thus fully addressing the task requirements.",
