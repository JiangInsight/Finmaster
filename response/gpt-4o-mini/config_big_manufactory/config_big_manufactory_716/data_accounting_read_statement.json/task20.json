Cost of Goods Sold: **20200000.00**\n\nThe \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line represents the total cost associated with the products or inventories that were sold during the reporting period.\n\nGiven that we found the relevant figure for the carrying amount of inventories sold, we can now present our result in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20200000.00'} }\n```",
