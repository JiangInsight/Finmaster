This includes costs incurred to obtain customer orders and deliver goods to customers.\n- **Selling Expenses**: These represent costs specifically related to selling activities, which may include expenses related to securing orders from customers. Selling expenses can be considered relevant as they deal with the costs incurred to make sales.\n\nAfter examining the provided income statement:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: \n   - Value: **20200000.00**\n   - This is a primary cost associated with the production and delivery of goods.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses**:\n   - Value: **1177105.26**\n   - These are additional costs that can include commissions, advertising, and other costs directly related to selling products.\n\nThe primary line item that represents costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services is the **Cost of Goods Sold**.\n\nThe solution requires us to extract the value of the **Cost of Goods Sold** from the income statement.\n\nSo, the value we need to present is **20200000.00**.\n\nThe final JSON output will be:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20200000.00'} }\n```",
