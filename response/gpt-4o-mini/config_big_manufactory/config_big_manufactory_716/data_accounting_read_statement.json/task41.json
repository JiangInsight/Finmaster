Here's how we will approach the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: In cash flow statements, the line item that represents tax accrued but not yet paid is typically expressed as \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\".\n\n2. **Locate the Amount**: From the provided cash flow statement, we are looking for the specific amount associated with the increase in tax payable.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: The cash flow statement indicates:\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable: 1428630.43\n\n4. **Format the Solution**: We then format the identified value in the specified JSON format.\n\nNow, compiling all of the above information, we can present the solution as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1428630.43'} }\n```",
