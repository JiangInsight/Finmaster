In the balance sheet:\n   - **Accounts Payable** shows an **End Amount** of **6600000.00** as of 2024-02-05.\n\n3. **Taxes Payable**: This represents amounts owed for taxes yet to be paid. In the balance sheet:\n   - **Taxes Payable** has an **End Amount** of **1428630.43** as of 2024-02-05.\n\n4. **Total Amount Owed for Goods or Services**: \n   To find the total amount owed for goods or services, we consider both accounts:\n   - Total = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable\n   - Total = **6600000.00** + **1428630.43**\n   - Total = **8028630.43**\n\n5. **Finalizing the Extraction**: If we specifically mention the amount to be extracted regarding credit received for goods/services, it is prudent to focus on Accounts Payable, as it directly relates to the goods/services.\n\nThus, the focus will primarily be on the **Accounts Payable** line item value, which is **6600000.00**.\n\nNow presenting the final output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6600000.00'} }\n```",
