Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers (typically the Cost of Goods Sold).\n2. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation (usually categorized under Financial Expenses).\n3. The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life (usually labeled as Depreciation).\n4. The total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period (commonly referred to as Tax Expense).\n\nLet's go through the given income statement carefully:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This represents the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services.\n  - From the income statement: COGS is `20200000.00`.\n\n- **Financial Expenses**: This line represents the financing costs incurred for operations.\n  - From the income statement: Financial Expenses is `372003.12`.\n\n- **Depreciation**: This represents the systematic allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life.\n  - From the income statement: Depreciation is `120970.16`.\n\n- **Tax Expense**: This is the amount of taxes to be paid or recovered during the reporting period.\n  - From the income statement: Tax Expense is `1428630.43`.\n\nNow that we have identified and extracted the values, we can present them in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '20200000.00', 'value2': '120970.16', 'value3': '372003.12', 'value4': '1428630.43'} }\n```",
