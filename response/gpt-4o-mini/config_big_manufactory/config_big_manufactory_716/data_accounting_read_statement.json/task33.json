The value corresponding to income arising from the entity's core operating activities, represented typically by \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue.\"\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided income statement step by step:\n\n1. **Main Business Revenue**: This represents the income from the core operating activities. In this case, the amount is **28572608.70**.\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold**: This reflects the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period. Here, the amount is **20200000.00**.\n\nNow that we have identified the relevant values, we can format them into the required JSON structure.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28572608.70', 'value2': '20200000.00'}}\n```",
