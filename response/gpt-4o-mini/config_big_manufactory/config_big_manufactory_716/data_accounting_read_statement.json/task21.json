Review the provided income statement data:\n   - **Main Business Revenue**: This represents the income derived from the entityâ€™s primary business operations. \n   - **Total Revenue**: This also includes revenues from all sources, including non-operating activities, but in many cases, it will overlap with the principal revenue from operations.\n\n2. Given the data:\n   - **Main Business Revenue**: 28572608.70 \n   - **Total Revenue**: 28572608.70 \n\nSince \"Main Business Revenue\" represents the direct income from the core business activities, and appears to be equivalent to the \"Total Revenue\" in this instance, we can extract the value from either, but it is more straightforward to refer to \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\nThus, the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '28572608.70'}}\n```",
