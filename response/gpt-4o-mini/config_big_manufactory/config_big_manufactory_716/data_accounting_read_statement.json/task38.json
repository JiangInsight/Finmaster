In cash flow statements, this is usually represented as \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Receivable\".\n\nHere's the relevant section from the provided cash flow statement:\n\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**: -14921566.06\n\nIn this case, the amount shown is a negative number, which indicates a decrease in accounts receivable, meaning that the entity collected cash from credit sales. We will extract this value for our solution.\n\nThus, the extracted value is -14921566.06.\n\nFollowing the requested JSON format, here's the answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-14921566.06'} }\n```",
