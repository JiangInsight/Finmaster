The entries that increase capital generally include cash deposits or other contributions to equity.\n\nUpon reviewing the transactions, I can see:\n\n1. **Cash deposit:** 5,000,000.0\n2. **Bank deposit:** 15,000,000.0\n3. **Fixed Assets:** 8,000,000.0\n\nThese three entries contribute directly to the initial paid-in capital. \n\n### Step 2: Calculate Initial Paid-in Capital\n\nInitial Paid-in Capital can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial Paid-in Capital} = 5,000,000.0 + 15,000,000.0 + 8,000,000.0 = 28,000,000.0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Identify Ending Paid-in Capital\n\nFor the ending paid-in capital, we need to consider any transactions that alter the capital during the period (i.e., purchases or expenses that might subtract from capital). \n\nAfter examining the entries, it appears that there are no transactions listed that would represent a permanent reduction of the capital resulting from business operations. The purchase and expense entries refer to operational expenses or asset acquisitions that should not reduce the total equity held.\n\nSince no additional capital transactions or distributions have taken place that would lower the capital, the ending paid-in capital will remain the same as the initial of 28,000,000.0.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe conclusion based on the identified data is:\n\n- **Paid-in Capital Initial Value:** 28,000,000.0\n- **Paid-in Capital End Value:** 28,000,000.0 (remains constant as there are no deductions)\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '28000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '28000000.00'} }\n```",
