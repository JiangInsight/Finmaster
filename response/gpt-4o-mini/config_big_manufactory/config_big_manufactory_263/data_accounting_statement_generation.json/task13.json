                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the provided transaction data to track the \"taxes payable\" over the timeframe given.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Transactions\nTax amounts are generally associated with sales. In this case, we will look for the sales transactions that have a `tax_amount` greater than zero and summarize these to compute the initial and final tax amounts. \n\n### Step 2: Analyze and Calculate the Initial and Final Values for Taxes Payable\nWe'll extract the relevant data based on the `tax_amount` field.\n\n1. **Initial Value** of Taxes Payable is typically taken at the start of the accounting period, which in this case is `0`, since no sales have been recorded before the initial date.\n\n2. **Final Value** of Taxes Payable needs to be computed by accumulating the taxes collected from sales.\n\nHereâ€™s how the calculation would go:\n\n**Sales Transactions Data:**\n- For each sales transaction, we'll accumulate the `tax_amount`:\n  - Sale on 2024-01-04 = Tax Amount: 52092.43\n  - Sale on 2024-01-13 = Tax Amount: 33441.54\n  - Sale on 2024-01-14 = Tax Amount: 32911.01\n  - Sale on 2024-01-22 = Tax Amount: 53435.55\n  - Sale on 2024-01-25 = Tax Amount: 66408.56\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of Total Taxes Payable at End Value\nNow we will sum these tax amounts:\n\n- Total Taxes Payable = 52092.43 + 33441.54 + 32911.01 + 53435.55 + 66408.56\n- Total Taxes Payable = 237088.09\n\n### Final Summary\n- **Initial Taxes Payable Value:** 0.00\n- **Final Taxes Payable Value:** 237088.09\n\n### Step 4: Presenting the Final Result\nNow we can format the result in the requested JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Taxes Payable End Value': '237088.09'}}\n```",
