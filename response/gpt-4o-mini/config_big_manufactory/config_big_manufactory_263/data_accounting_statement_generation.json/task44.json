The following entries seem relevant:\n\n1. **Purchase - Equipment B**\n   - Amount: 800000.0\n   - Recorded Amount: 800000.0\n\n2. **Purchase - Equipment A**\n   - Amount: 500000.0\n   - Recorded Amount: 500000.0\n\n3. **Purchase - Equipment A** (another entry)\n   - Amount: 1000000.0\n   - Recorded Amount: 1000000.0\n   \n4. **Purchase - Equipment B** (another entry)\n   - Amount: 800000.0\n   - Recorded Amount: 800000.0\n\n5. **Purchase - Equipment C**\n   - Amount: 2000000.0\n   - Recorded Amount: 2000000.0\n\n6. **Purchase - Equipment B** (another entry)\n   - Amount: 800000.0\n   - Recorded Amount: 800000.0\n\n7. **Purchase - Equipment C** (another entry)\n   - Amount: 2000000.0\n   - Recorded Amount: 2000000.0\n\nNow, I will sum up all the relevant purchases to determine the total purchase amount for fixed assets:\n\n- Equipment B: \\(800000.0\\)\n- Equipment A: \\(500000.0\\)\n- Equipment A: \\(1000000.0\\)\n- Equipment B: \\(800000.0\\)\n- Equipment C: \\(2000000.0\\)\n- Equipment B: \\(800000.0\\)\n- Equipment C: \\(2000000.0\\)\n\n### Summing up these amounts:\n\\[ \n800000 + 500000 + 1000000 + 800000 + 2000000 + 800000 + 2000000 = 10000000 \n\\]\n\nThus, the final purchase of fixed assets is **10,000,000.**\n\nThe solution will be presented in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": \"10000000\"}}\n```",
