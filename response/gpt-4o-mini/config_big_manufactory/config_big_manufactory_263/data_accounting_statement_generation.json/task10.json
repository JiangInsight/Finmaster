                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total non-current assets at both the initial and final values based on provided transactions. Here's how to approach it step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Values\nFrom the given data in the **\"Initial\"** transactions, we note the following:\n\n1. **Cash deposit:** 5,000,000\n2. **Bank deposit:** 15,000,000\n3. **Fixed Assets:** 8,000,000\n\nWe add these values to compute the total non-current assets at the initial date.\n\n### Initial Value Calculation\n\\[\n\\text{Total Non-current Assets Initial Value} = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify Changes to Non-current Assets\nNext, we parse through the transactions to locate any entries related to purchases or disposals of non-current assets, as well as depreciation. Here are the relevant transactions:\n\n- **Purchases** of fixed assets:\n    1. Purchase for Heavy Equipment B: 800,000\n    2. Purchase for Heavy Equipment A: 500,000\n    3. Purchase for Heavy Equipment A: 1,000,000\n    4. Purchase for Heavy Equipment B: 800,000\n    5. Purchase for Heavy Equipment C: 2,000,000\n    6. Purchase for Heavy Equipment C: 3,000,000\n    7. Purchase for Heavy Equipment B: 2,000,000\n    8. Purchase for Heavy Equipment A: 5,000,000\n    9. Purchase for Heavy Equipment C: 2,000,000\n\n- **Depreciation** entries:\n    - Each month there is a depreciation recorded (45750.46 twice in January).\n  \nFrom this, we can determine the total purchases of fixed assets and then adjust for depreciation.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Final Values\nWe'll tally the purchases and deduct depreciation:\n\n#### Total Purchases\nTotal of all purchases related to heavy equipment:\n\\[\n800,000 + 500,000 + 1{,}000{,}000 + 800{,}000 + 2{,}000{,}000 + 3{,}000{,}000 + 2{,}000{,}000 + 5{,}000{,}000 + 2{,}000{,}000 = 17{,}100{,}000\n\\]\n\n#### Total Depreciation\nSince there's a depreciation of 45750.46 recorded over multiple instances, we account the duration for two months of depreciation in January (twice):\n\\[\n45750.46 \\times 2 = 91{,}500.92\n\\]\n\n### Final Calculation\nThe final value after accounting for purchases and depreciation:\n\\[\n\\text{Final Value} = \\text{Initial Value} + \\text{Total Purchases} - \\text{Total Depreciation}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 28{,}000{,}000 + 17{,}100{,}000 - 91{,}500.92\n\\]\n\\[\n= 45{,}008{,}499.08\n\\]\n\nThe final non-current asset value may need to be presented in accordance with significant figures, so let's round it accordingly if necessary. \n\n### Final Result\nBased on our calculations, we present the results in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '28000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '45008499.08'}}\n```",
