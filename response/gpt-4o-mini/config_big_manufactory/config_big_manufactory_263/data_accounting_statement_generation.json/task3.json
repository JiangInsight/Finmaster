                        "content": "To calculate the inventory values for the given transactions, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Inventory Value**:\n   Initially, we are provided the transactions that include:\n   - Cash deposits\n   - Bank deposits\n   - Fixed Assets\n   - Purchases\n   \n   The inventory value starts at **0.00** because there are no inventory transactions before the listed purchases.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Purchases**:\n   In the provided dataset, there are several purchase transactions indicated where inventory is purchased:\n   - **Purchase20231231001**: 800000.0\n   - **Purchase20231231002**: 500000.0\n   - **Purchase20231231003**: 1000000.0\n   - **Purchase20231231004**: 800000.0\n   - **Purchase20231231005**: 2000000.0\n   - **Purchase20231231006**: 3000000.0\n   - **Purchase20231231007**: 800000.0\n   - **Purchase20231231008**: 2000000.0\n   - **Purchase20231231009**: 500000.0\n   - **Purchase20231231010**: 3000000.0\n   - **Purchase20231231011**: 800000.0\n   - **Purchase20231231012**: 1600000.0\n   - **Purchase20231231013**: 2000000.0\n  \n   Now let's sum up the amounts:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Purchases} = 800000.0 + 500000.0 + 1000000.0 + 800000.0 + 2000000.0 + 3000000.0 + 800000.0 + 2000000.0 + 500000.0 + 3000000.0 + 800000.0 + 1600000.0 + 2000000.0 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 7200000.0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Sales and Adjust Inventory**:\n   Next, we also need to consider the sales amounts. In this case, every sale reduces the inventory. \n   \n   The sales-related transactions do not change the cost for our inventory calculation explicitly, but they signify that the items have been sold. We need to look at sales accurately from the data provided.\n   \n   For example:\n   - **Sale20240104001** implies sale of 1 unit of Heavy Equipment B for 1041848.53.\n   - **Sale20240108002** of Heavy Equipment C for 1378082.08.\n   - **Sale20240109003** of Heavy Equipment C.\n   - Sales continue to apply to multiple sales throughout the transaction set.\n\n4. **Calculate Ending Inventory**:\n   In a balance sheet context, we will assume that value of inventory remaining at the end should subtract the sales from the total purchase which we don't track as the data given does not define stock-level details for items.\n\nHowever, based on the ending purchase count of **7200000.00**, our only losses are in terms of cost per unit (invested) from expensive sales reducing cash flow.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   Assuming all purchased items went to the balance sheet and considering Sales as a separate element for cash flow:\n   - **Ending Inventory = Total Purchases = 7200000.0**\n   - **Initial Inventory = 0.0**\n\nThe final answer thus should reflect:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '7200000.00'} }\n```",
