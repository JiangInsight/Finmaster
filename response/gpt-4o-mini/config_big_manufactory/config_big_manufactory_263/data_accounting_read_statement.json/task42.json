Specifically, we need to find line items related to purchases of fixed assets or any mention of long-term assets.\n\nLet's examine the provided information carefully.\n\nIn the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", we have the following entry:\n\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 0.00\n\nThis indicates that there were no cash payments made for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment during this period.\n\nSince the amount for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is 0.00, we conclude that there were no cash outflows related to acquiring these long-term assets.\n\nNow we need to format our answer into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
