This indicates the amount allocated for depreciation in the reporting period.\n\n2. **Confirming Depreciation in Other Statements:**\n   Next, we can confirm that this value is recorded consistently in the cash flow statement:\n   - The cash flow statement also lists \"Depreciation\" with the same value of **91498.88**.\n   \n   Additionally, examining the balance sheet provides useful context:\n   - \"Accumulated Depreciation\" totals **91498.88**, which shows the aggregate amount of depreciation that has been accumulated over time.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   Since all relevant statements (income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet) consistently cite the depreciation value, we can conclude that **91498.88** reflects the systematic allocation of depreciation for the asset over its useful life.\n\n### Final Output:\nIn JSON format, the answer will be presented as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91498.88'} }\n```",
