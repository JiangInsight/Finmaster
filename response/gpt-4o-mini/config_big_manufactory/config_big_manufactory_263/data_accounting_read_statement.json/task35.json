Here are the required items based on the descriptions:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services (Cost of Goods Sold)**\n2. **Financing costs incurred to raise funds needed for production and operation (Financial Expenses)**\n3. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life (Depreciation)**\n4. **Total amount of taxes expected to be paid or recovered during the reporting period (Tax Expense)**\n\nFrom the provided income statement, let's extract the values for each of these items:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** = 10400000.00\n2. **Financial Expenses** = 559176.01\n3. **Depreciation** = 91498.88\n4. **Tax Expense** = 727140.68\n\nNow, we can organize these extracted values in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10400000.00', 'value2': '559176.01', 'value3': '91498.88', 'value4': '727140.68'}}\n```",
