In the provided balance sheet, these terms are relevant because they typically signify assets in the ordinary course of business.\n\n2. **Examine the balance sheet provided**:\n   - The line item \"Inventory\" is present, which usually refers to assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business. \n   - The balance sheet indicates:\n     - Initial amount of Inventory: `0.00`\n     - End amount of Inventory: `8400000.00`\n     \n3. **Document the values**: \n   - Initial amount (for inventory): `0.00`\n   - End amount (for inventory): `8400000.00`\n\nGiven this analysis, the initial and end values of the assets held for sale or production come solely from the \"Inventory\" line item.\n\nTherefore, the answer, formatted in the required JSON output, is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '8400000.00'} }\n```",
