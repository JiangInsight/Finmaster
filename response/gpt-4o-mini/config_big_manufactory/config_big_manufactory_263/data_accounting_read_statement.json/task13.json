These assets typically include fixed assets and possibly non-current assets. The key detail is that we are looking for these specific line items to provide their initial and end values.\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step using the data provided.\n\n1. **Identify Fixed Assets and Non-current Assets:**\n   - From the balance sheet, the relevant line items that generally qualify as fixed or non-current assets are:\n     - Fixed Assets: 8000000.00 (initial), 8000000.00 (end)\n     - Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00 (initial), 91498.88 (end) - this is not an asset but a contra asset account.\n     - Total Non-current Assets: 8000000.00 (initial), 7908501.12 (end)\n\n2. **Determine Total Non-current Assets:**\n   - The total non-current assets figure reflects the net value after depreciation:\n     - Initial Total Non-current Assets = 8000000.00\n     - End Total Non-current Assets = 7908501.12\n\n3. **Check the context of the asset usage:**\n   - In this case, the relevant value we need is from the Total Non-current Assets since these would consist of assets that are physical and not meant for current consumption.\n\n4. **Final Extraction:**\n   - We will present the values of total non-current assets which are not expected to be realized in the normal operating cycle:\n     - Initial value = 8000000.00\n     - End value = 7908501.12\n\nGiven these line item analyses, we can now formulate our output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7908501.12'} }\n```",
