                        "content": "To tackle the problem, we need to extract specific financial information from the provided financial statements categorized into three main sections: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement. The line items of interest are:\n\n1. **Value before tax expense** (Profit Before Tax) from the Income Statement.\n2. **Addition in the amount owed** by the entity (Accounts Payable) from the Balance Sheet.\n3. **Capital contributed by shareholders** (Paid-in Capital) from the Balance Sheet.\n\nLet's analyze and extract the required values from the data provided:\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Balance Sheet\nThe Balance Sheet contains the following relevant line items:\n- **Paid-in Capital**: This is the capital contributed by shareholders. The end value is `28000000.00`.\n- **Total Current Liabilities – Accounts Payable**: The amount owed by the entity for goods or services received on credit cannot be directly inferred here since the Accounts Payable line is `0.00`.\n\nSince there's no value for Accounts Payable, we cannot derive a valid amount for this point regarding the addition in the amount owed by the entity. \n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Income Statement\nThe Income Statement contains the line item:\n- **Profit Before Tax**: The profit before deducting tax expense is `1133140.32`.\n\n### Step 3: Gathering the Data\nBased on the extracted values, we summarize them as follows:\n1. **Value** (Paid-in Capital from Balance Sheet): `28000000.00`\n2. **Profit Before Tax**: `1133140.32`\n3. **Accounts Payable**: Since there is no addition information currently displayed (`0.00`), we leave this as empty.\n\nGiven this analysis, we have:\n- **Paid-in Capital** from the Balance Sheet: `28000000.00`\n- **Profit Before Tax** from the Income Statement: `1133140.32`\n- **Accounts Payable** is `0.00` as there is no related addition in the current data in the Balance Sheet.\n\n### Step 4: Structuring the Solution\nWhile we typically would have provided an answer for the value owed by the entity, as it appears `0.00`, this does not provide meaningful insight toward that point. \n\nWith the recorded values, we can still create a structure of the solution. Here’s how we express that in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '28000000.00', 'value2': '1133140.32', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```\n\nThus, the solution is effectively communicated while clearly indicating the capital and profit values.",
