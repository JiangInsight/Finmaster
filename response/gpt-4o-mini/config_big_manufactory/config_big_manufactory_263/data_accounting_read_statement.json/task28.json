In the given income statement, we can see the line item \"Tax Expense\".\n\n2. **Extract the Amount**: The amount associated with the \"Tax Expense\" line is provided as \"727140.68\". This represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period.\n\n3. **Format the Result**: We need to present this extracted information in the specified JSON format.\n\nBased on our reasoning above, we can present the final answer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '727140.68'} }\n```",
