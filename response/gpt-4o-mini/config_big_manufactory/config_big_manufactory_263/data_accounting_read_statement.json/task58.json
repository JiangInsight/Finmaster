The essential part is to focus on the \"Beginning Balance\" related to cash and cash equivalents, as mentioned.\n\n### Step 1: Review the Balance Sheet\n\nFrom the balance sheet data:\n\n- Cash on Hand: 5,000,000.00\n- Bank Deposits: 15,000,000.00\n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents would typically include both cash on hand and bank deposits. However, the statement specifically outlines \"Total Current Assets\" rather than \"Total Cash and Cash Equivalents\". \n\n### Step 2: Check the Cash Flow Statement\n\nIn the cash flow statement, we see:\n\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents:\n  - Beginning Balance: 20,000,000.00\n  \nThe beginning balance directly indicates the value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period. This is the specific line item we need.\n\n### Step 3: Finalize the Answer\n\nAccording to the cash flow statement, the value we are interested in is clearly stated under \"Beginning Balance\":\n- Beginning Balance: **20,000,000.00**\n\nTherefore, we summarize our findings as follows.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20000000.00'}}\n```",
