In this case, we are specifically looking for the \"Interest Receivable\" line item. \n\nLet's analyze the balance sheet:\n\n- We look for the relevant account and find:\n  - \"Interest Receivable\"\n    - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n    - End Amount: `20559.00`\n    \nThe initial value is `0.00`, which indicates that there was no interest accrued initially. The end value of `20559.00` shows that as of the end date, there was interest that had accrued but had not yet been received.\n\nNow, we put this information into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '20559.00'} }\n```",
