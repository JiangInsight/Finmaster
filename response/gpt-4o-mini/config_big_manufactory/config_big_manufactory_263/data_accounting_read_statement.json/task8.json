In this context, the relevant accounts are:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable** - which represents the amount owed to creditors for goods or services received.\n2. **Taxes Payable** - which represents the taxes owed to the government.\n\nLet's analyze the given balance sheet data for these accounts:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**\n   - Initial Amount: 0.00\n   - End Amount: 0.00\n\n2. **Taxes Payable**\n   - Initial Amount: 0.00\n   - End Amount: 727140.68\n\nGiven this information, we summarize the findings:\n\n- **Accounts Payable** has an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 0.00, indicating no amounts owed in this account.\n- **Taxes Payable** has an initial value of 0.00 and an end value of 727140.68, indicating that the entity has an amount owed for taxes.\n\nSince we are primarily interested in the amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit, we consider only the **Taxes Payable** account along with the end value.\n\nNow, combining the findings into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '727140.68'}}\n```",
