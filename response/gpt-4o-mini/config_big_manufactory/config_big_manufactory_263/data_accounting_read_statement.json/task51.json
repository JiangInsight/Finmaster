We will extract the initial value and the end value of the interest accrued but not yet received. \n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: From the balance sheet provided, we look for 'Interest Receivable', which is the line item that indicates interest accrued but not yet received.\n\n2. **Extract Initial Amount**:\n   - The initial amount of interest receivable is noted in the balance sheet as **0.00**. This reflects the value at the start of the period (2023-12-31).\n\n3. **Extract End Amount**:\n   - The end amount of interest receivable is **20559.00** as indicated in the balance sheet for the end date (2024-02-05).\n\n4. **Formatting the Solution**:\n   - Now that we have both values, we format them according to the requirements specified in the output JSON.\n\nFollowing these steps, the extracted values are:\n- Initial value: '0.00'\n- End value: '20559.00'\n\nThus, the final solution will look like this:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '20559.00'} }\n```",
