In this case, itâ€™s a combination of \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\", but since no specific line item combines these, we can note the ending cash and cash equivalents as the last balance indicated in total assets (this is usually the sum, but here we'll get line items):\n     - Cash on Hand: 1482632.85\n     - Bank Deposits: 1100000.00 (Total cash equivalents are \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\" together, which are relevant to the operating activities).\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - Here we need the \"Total Revenue\" and \"Tax Expense\":\n     - Total Revenue: 14542813.42\n     - Tax Expense: 727140.68\n   \n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - We will find \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\":\n     - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -17417367.15\n\nFrom the statements:\n- The cash and cash equivalents represent the sum of cash on hand and bank deposits to resemble operating activities.\n- We will also extract the amounts of taxes accrued which is the \"Tax Expense\".\n- The total income from regular activities is captured by \"Total Revenue\".\n\nFinally, we format the extracted information in the required JSON format.\n\nThe cumulative values prepped for JSON:\n- Total Cash and Cash Equivalents: Use the ending cash equivalents, noted from the Cash Flow statement.\n- Tax Accrued but Not Paid: 727140.68\n- Total Income from Ordinary Activities: 14542813.42\n\nThe necessary solution looks like this:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '727140.68', 'value2': '14542813.42', 'value3': '-17417367.15'} }\n```",
