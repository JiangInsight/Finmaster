The amount is **-10,221,447.35** (note: the amount is negative as it reflects a decrease).\n- **Financial Expenses**: This amount is **559,176.01**.\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This amount is **0.00** (indicating no cash payment occurred for fixed asset purchases).\n\n### Income Statement\nFrom the income statement, we look for:\n- The **Main Business Revenue** and **Interest Income** do not match our criteria; however, we only need the \"Financial Expenses\" which we already noted from the cash flow statement.\n\nNow we compile our findings:\n\n- Accounts Receivable from the Balance Sheet: **10,221,447.35** (value for goods or services on credit).\n- Financial Expenses from the Cash Flow Statement: **559,176.01**.\n- Cash payment for the Purchase of Fixed Assets from the Cash Flow Statement: **0.00**.\n\n### Summary of Values\n- **value1**: 10,221,447.35 (Accounts Receivable)\n- **value2**: 559,176.01 (Financial Expenses)\n- **value3**: 0.00 (Purchase of Fixed Assets)\n\n### Final Output\nNow let's format these findings according to the required JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10221447.35', 'value2': '559176.01', 'value3': '0.00'}}\n```",
