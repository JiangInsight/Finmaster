For the Balance Sheet: \n   - **Bank Deposits** — End Amount: **1,100,000.00**\n2. For the Income Statement: \n   - **Interest Income** — Amount: **20,559.00**\n\n### Final Output\nThe final values of interest are:\n- **value1** (for Bank Deposits): **1,100,000.00**\n- **value2** (for Interest Income): **20,559.00**\n\nWe will now format this in the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1100000.00', 'value2': '20559.00'}}\n```",
