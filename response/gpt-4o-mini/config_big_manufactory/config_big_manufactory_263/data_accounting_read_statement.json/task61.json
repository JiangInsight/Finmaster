Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services (typically found in the Income Statement as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or related line items).\n2. Cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets (typically found in the Cash Flow Statement under \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" or similar line items).\n\nLet's analyze the provided financial statements step by step:\n\n### Balance Sheet\n- **Line items of interest:** None that directly relate to the requested values, so we will omit this section for values.\n\n### Cash Flow Statement\n- The relevant line item here is:\n  - **Purchase of Fixed Assets:** 0.00 (This line shows cash payments to acquire long-term assets, which is relevant to our query.)\n\n### Income Statement\n- The relevant line item here is:\n  - **Cost of Goods Sold:** 10,400,000.00 (This line represents the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services.)\n\n### Summary of Extracted Values\n- From the **Income Statement**, we have:\n  - Cost of Goods Sold: **10,400,000.00**\n  \n- From the **Cash Flow Statement**, we have:\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets: **0.00**\n\n### Output Formatting\nWe need to group these outputs as specified in the instructions. The extracted values from the relevant sections are distributed accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the final solution in the required JSON format is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '10400000.00', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```",
