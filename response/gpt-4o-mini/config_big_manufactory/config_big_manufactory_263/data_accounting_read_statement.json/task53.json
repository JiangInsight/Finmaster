The values are:\n     - Initial Amount: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n     - End Amount: 8400000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - Here, we find the \"Increase\" or \"Decrease\" in Inventory. The amount related to inventories is:\n     - (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: -8400000.00 (2024-02-05)\n\n   This indicates that there was a decrease in inventories by 8,400,000. However, this amount doesn't specify the cost of inventories sold directly.\n\n3. **Income Statement**:\n   - Look for \"Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\". This is the amount representing the carrying value of the inventories sold during the period:\n     - Cost of Goods Sold: 10400000.00 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which is specifically captured in the Cost of Goods Sold, is **10,400,000.00**.\n\nNow, the answer needs to be formatted in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '10400000.00'} }\n```",
