In this case, it is **14542813.42**.\n\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This is the direct cost attributable to the production of the goods sold by the entity. Here it is **10400000.00**.\n\n3. **Total Expenses**: This includes all operating expenses incurred by the business. It is given as **3030232.10**.\n\n4. **Interest Income**: This is the income earned from interest, which is **20559.00**.\n\n5. **Tax Expense**: The tax obligations for the period, accounted for as **727140.68**.\n\nNow, we calculate the Net Profit step-by-step:\n\n- **Gross Profit** = Total Revenue - COGS\n  - **Gross Profit** = 14542813.42 - 10400000.00 = **4142813.42**\n\n- Subtract Total Expenses from Gross Profit to get Profit Before Tax:\n  - **Profit Before Tax** = Gross Profit - Total Expenses\n  - **Profit Before Tax** = 4142813.42 - 3030232.10 = **1133140.32**\n\n- Add Interest Income to Profit Before Tax:\n  - **Profit Before Tax** = 1133140.32 + 20559.00 = **1153699.32**\n\n- Subtract Tax Expense from Profit Before Tax to get Net Profit:\n  - **Net Profit** = Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense\n  - **Net Profit** = 1153699.32 - 727140.68 = **405999.64**\n\nNow we must present the results in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n  'value': '405999.64', \n  'sub_items_sub_item value1': '14542813.42',   // Total Revenue\n  'sub_items_sub_item value2': '10400000.00',    // Cost of Goods Sold\n  'sub_items_sub_item value3': '3030232.10',     // Total Expenses\n  'sub_items_sub_item value4': '20559.00',       // Interest Income\n  'sub_items_sub_item value5': '727140.68'        // Tax Expense\n}}\n```",
