It is critical to note that depreciation relates to asset expense recognition.\n   - In the balance sheet, the initial and final amounts for \"Accumulated Depreciation\" are:\n     - Initial Amount (2023-12-31): 0.00\n     - End Amount (2024-02-05): 91498.88\n\n2. **Extract the Values:**\n   - Initial value (before any depreciation has been recorded): 0.00\n   - Final value (after depreciation expense has been recognized): 91498.88\n\n3. **Format the Result:**\n   - We will present the extracted values in the specified JSON format, highlighting the initial and final values of the depreciation expense.\n\nThe final solution in JSON format is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91498.88'} }\n```",
