The three line items we are looking for are:\n\n1. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** - This represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets** - This represents the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.\n3. **Beginning Balance** - This represents the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\nLet's look at the provided cash flow statement step by step:\n\n- **Line Item for Accounts Payable**: \n  - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: `0.00`. \n  - This indicates that there was no increase in accounts payable during this period, meaning no additional credit was taken.\n\n- **Line Item for Fixed Assets**: \n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets: `0.00`. \n  - This indicates that there were no fixed assets purchased during this period.\n\n- **Line Item for Cash and Cash Equivalents - Beginning Balance**: \n  - Beginning Balance: `20000000.00`. \n  - This is the cash and cash equivalents balance at the start of the period.\n\nNow we need to construct our solution based on the values we extracted:\n\n1. value1 (Increase in Accounts Payable): `0.00`\n2. value2 (Purchase of Fixed Assets): `0.00`\n3. value3 (Beginning Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents): `20000000.00`\n\nNow we can formulate the solution in JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '0.00', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '20000000.00'} }\n```",
