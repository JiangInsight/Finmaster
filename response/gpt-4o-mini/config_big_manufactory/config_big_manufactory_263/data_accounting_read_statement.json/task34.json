Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities: This typically corresponds to \"Total Revenue.\"\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period: This corresponds to \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole: This corresponds to \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\nLet's extract these values step by step from the provided problem statement.\n\nThe relevant sections of the income statement are:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: This is identified as \"Total Revenue\" in the statement, which is **14542813.42**.\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: This refers to the cost recognized when inventory is sold, labeled as \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which is **10400000.00**.\n- **Administrative Expenses**: This is stated directly as \"Administrative Expenses,\" and the relevant amount is **1416371.84**.\n\nNow, we present the values in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14542813.42', 'value2': '10400000.00', 'value3': '1416371.84'} }\n```",
