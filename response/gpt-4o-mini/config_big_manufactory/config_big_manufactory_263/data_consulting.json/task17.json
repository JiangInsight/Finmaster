                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: According to the cash flow statement, the net cash flow from operating activities is given as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} = -17417367.15\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify Total Debt**: Total debt can generally be defined as total liabilities. From the balance sheet, we can check for total liabilities:\n   - **Total Current Liabilities**: 727140.68\n   - **Long-term Liabilities**: Since there's no information about long-term liabilities, we will assume that all liabilities are current:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Liabilities} = 727140.68\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: The formula for the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-17417367.15}{727140.68} \\approx -23.96\n   \\]\n\n4. **Round the Result**: We will keep the numerical value precise and round it as needed for a clearer presentation.\n\nFinally, we can present the result in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-23.96'}}\n```",
