                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we need the following information:\n\n1. **Net Credit Sales**: This is typically derived from total revenue or sales, excluding any cash sales. In this case, we can assume that the entire total revenue is from credit sales as thereâ€™s no other information indicating cash sales.\n   \n   From the income statement, the total revenue = 14,542,813.42.\n\n2. **Average Accounts Receivable**: This is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n   According to the balance sheet, the beginning accounts receivable (as of December 31, 2023) is 0.00, and the ending accounts receivable (as of February 5, 2024) is 10,221,447.35.\n\n   So, the average accounts receivable can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 10221447.35}{2} = 5110723.675\n   \\]\n\n3. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**: This is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n   \\]\n   \n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{14542813.42}{5110723.675} \\approx 2.85\n   \\]\n\nNow we present the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.85'} }\n```",
