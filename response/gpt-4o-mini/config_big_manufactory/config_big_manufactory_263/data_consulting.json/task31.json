Rounding where necessary to two decimal places (for clarity).\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"1.43\", \n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-23.97\", \n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-23.97\", \n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.50\", \n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.03\"\n}}\n```",
