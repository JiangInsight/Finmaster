The value of income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities, which is represented by \"Main Business Revenue\".\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which is reflected by \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nNow, let's look at the provided income statement and extract the corresponding values for these line items.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n\n- **Main Business Revenue** is labeled with the account and amount:\n  - Main Business Revenue: 20318450.67\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold** is labeled with the account and amount:\n  - Cost of Goods Sold: 14600000.00\n\nNow that we have identified the necessary amounts, we can structure the answer in the requested format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '20318450.67', 'value2': '14600000.00'}}\n```",
