The income statement is formatted in a table showing different accounting items, their amounts, and the reporting date.\n2. We are particularly interested in the line item that specifies the amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period. \n3. In the provided data, the relevant line item is labeled \"Tax Expense\":\n   - Tax Expense: 1015922.54\n\nFrom here, we observe that the value associated with the \"Tax Expense\" line item is **1015922.54**. This indicates the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period.\n\nNow, we can present our findings in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1015922.54'} }\n```",
