The amount is shown as **0.00** for both the initial and end dates, which means that, at the end of the reporting period, there are no payables owed.\n\n   - **Taxes Payable**: This item has an end amount of **1,015,922.54**, which indicates obligations owed to the tax authorities that may not relate directly to goods or services acquired on credit. \n\n2. **Cash Flow Analysis**: The cash flow statement includes the change in accounts payable:\n   - The entry for \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" shows **0.00**, indicating that there was no increase in amount owed during the period.\n\n3. **Conclusion on Current Liabilities**: After analyzing \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\":\n   - Given that \"Accounts Payable\" indicates no credit purchases (at least not registered here), and \"Taxes Payable\" does not qualify as a credit line for goods/services, we deduce that there is effectively no amount owed for goods or services purchased on credit during this period.\n\nThe only line item in the liabilities directly associated with goods/services acquired on credit would have been \"Accounts Payable,\" which is zero.\n\nPutting that together, the output for the \"solution\" field would reflect that the value of the addition in the amount owed is **0.00**.\n\nThus, the final answer in the specified JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
