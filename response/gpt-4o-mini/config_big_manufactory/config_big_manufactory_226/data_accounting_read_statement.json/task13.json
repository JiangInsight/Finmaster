Typically, these would be the fixed assets and any long-term investments.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can analyze the relevant line items:\n\n1. **Cash on Hand** - This is a current asset and likely intended for normal business operations.\n2. **Bank Deposits** - This too is considered a current asset.\n3. **Interest Receivable** - This is classified as a current asset as it is expected to be realized in the short term.\n4. **Accounts Receivable** - This is also a current asset.\n5. **Inventory** - Current asset as it is meant for sale.\n6. **Total Current Assets** - This is a sum of current assets.\n7. **Fixed Assets** - These are long-term assets, not expected to be realized in the normal operating cycle; they are not intended for sale.\n8. **Accumulated Depreciation** - This is a contra asset account related to fixed assets, but it's not a separate asset; it reduces the value of fixed assets.\n9. **Total Non-current Assets** - This includes fixed assets, which are relevant to our problem.\n10. **Total Assets** - This includes both current and non-current assets.\n\nFrom the items identified, the main relevant line item for the problem is \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Total Non-current Assets\". \n\nHere are the values we will extract:\n- **Initial value of Total Non-current Assets (Fixed Assets)**: 8000000.00\n- **End value of Total Non-current Assets (Fixed Assets)**: 10543194.25\n\nNow, we'll format the final answer in the required JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '10543194.25'} }\n```",
