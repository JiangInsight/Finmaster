                        "content": "To identify the specific line items and value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers from the provided income statement, we need to focus on relevant categories typically involved in order fulfillment. The pertinent line items in this case are likely to include:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** – This reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company, which includes the cost of materials and labor directly involved in production.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses** – These represent costs associated with securing customer orders, such as marketing, distribution, and sales commissions.\n\nNow, looking at the provided income statement:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 14,600,000.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: 1,325,774.90\n\nAdding these two amounts together provides the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services:\n\nTotal Costs = Cost of Goods Sold + Selling Expenses\nTotal Costs = 14,600,000.00 + 1,325,774.90 = 15,925,774.90\n\nHowever, since the instruction only requires us to extract the **Selling Expenses** as the cost directly linked to securing customer orders, we will focus on that alone.\n\nThus, the value to be extracted is 1,325,774.90 for the Selling Expenses.\n\nNow, the answer will be formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1325774.90'} }\n```",
