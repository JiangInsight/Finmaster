We'll analyze each of the three financial statements: balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement.\n\n1. **Identify Tax Related Items in Each Statement:**\n   - **Balance Sheet:** Look at \"Taxes Payable\".\n     - Line item: Taxes Payable\n     - Value: 1,015,922.54\n     \n   - **Cash Flow Statement:** Look at \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\".\n     - Line item: Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\n     - Value: 1,015,922.54 (this indicates the change in taxes payable, which adds to the cash outflow).\n     \n   - **Income Statement:** Look at \"Tax Expense\".\n     - Line item: Tax Expense\n     - Value: 1,015,922.54\n\n2. **Total Amount of Tax:**\n   From the income statement, we find a clear indication of the tax that the entity recorded as an expense during this reporting period, which is also confirmed by the taxes payable in the balance sheet. The value of tax recorded in the income statement as tax expense is direct evidence of the tax obligation for the period.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   The entity is expected to pay a total tax amount of **1,015,922.54** based on the statements reviewed.\n\nPutting this into the required JSON format, the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1015922.54'} }\n```",
