Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit. This is best represented by “Accounts Receivable.”\n2. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation, represented by “Financial Expenses”.\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment, and other long-term assets, represented by “Purchase of Fixed Assets”.\n\nWe will extract the relevant data from the given balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Let's look at each statement in the prescribed order:\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\nFrom the Balance Sheet, we can find:\n- **Accounts Receivable:** This is the amount owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit.\n  - End Amount: **12792007.89**\n\n### 2. Income Statement\nFrom the Income Statement, we can find:\n- **Financial Expenses:** This represents the financing costs incurred by the enterprise.\n  - Amount: **297417.97**\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement, we can find:\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets:** This represents cash payments for acquiring property, plant, and equipment.\n  - Amount: **2670827.47**\n\nNow we compile these extracted values as required for the JSON solution format.\n\n### Solution JSON Format\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '12792007.89', 'value2': '297417.97', 'value3': '2670827.47'}}\n``` \n\nThis JSON structure accurately represents your requested data from the financial statements.",
