The amount is stated as `-12792007.89`, which indicates an increase in the negative value for accounts receivable. This effectively represents a decrease in amounts owed to the entity, as the entity is receiving cash for sales made on credit and thus reducing the outstanding amounts.\n\nTherefore, the specific value of the decrease is `-12792007.89`.\n\nNow, let's format the solution according to the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-12792007.89'}}\n```",
