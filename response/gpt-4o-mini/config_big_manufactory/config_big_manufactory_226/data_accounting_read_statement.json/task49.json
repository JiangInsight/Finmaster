                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to extract three specific line items from the provided cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: This represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n   \n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This indicates the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.\n\n3. **Beginning Balance**: This refers to the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\nNow, let's locate these line items in the provided cash flow statement:\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement:\n- The account **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable** is listed under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\", and it shows `0.00` for this period.\n- The account **Purchase of Fixed Assets** is listed under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", and it shows `2670827.47`.\n- The account **Beginning Balance** for \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" shows `20000000.00`.\n\nNow, putting together these values as per the requirements:\n\n1. Value1 (Increase in Accounts Payable) = `0.00`\n2. Value2 (Purchase of Fixed Assets) = `2670827.47`\n3. Value3 (Beginning Balance) = `20000000.00`\n\nFinally, we can now format the solution in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '0.00', 'value2': '2670827.47', 'value3': '20000000.00'}}\n```",
