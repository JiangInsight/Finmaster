Total income arising from the entity's ordinary activities.\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole.\n\nFrom the income statement provided, we can find these line items as follows:\n\n1. **Total income arising from the entity's ordinary activities**: This is represented by the \"Total Revenue\" line item. In the provided statement, the total revenue is **20318450.67**.\n   \n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item. In the provided statement, the cost of goods sold is **14600000.00**.\n   \n3. **Costs of general management and administration**: This is captured in the \"Administrative Expenses\" line item. The administrative expenses in the provided statement amount to **1127712.35**.\n\nCollecting these values while keeping them in the order from the income statement, we have:\n- Total Revenue: **20318450.67** (value1)\n- Cost of Goods Sold: **14600000.00** (value2)\n- Administrative Expenses: **1127712.35** (value3)\n\nUsing this step-by-step reasoning, we can formulate the final output.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '20318450.67', 'value2': '14600000.00', 'value3': '1127712.35'}}\n```",
