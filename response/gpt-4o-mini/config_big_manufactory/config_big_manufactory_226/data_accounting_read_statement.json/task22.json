We are specifically looking for the values of \"Total Revenue\" and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" to calculate the difference, which is known as \"Gross Profit.\"\n\nHere's how to approach the problem step by step:\n\n1. Find the line item for \"Total Revenue\":\n   - From the provided income statement, the \"Total Revenue\" is **20318450.67**.\n\n2. Find the line item for \"Cost of Goods Sold\":\n   - The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is **14600000.00**.\n\n3. Calculate the difference between \"Total Revenue\" and \"Cost of Goods Sold\":\n   - Gross Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold \n   - Gross Profit = 20318450.67 - 14600000.00 \n   - Gross Profit = 5718450.67\n\n4. Present the Gross Profit value in the required JSON format.\n\nBased on the calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5718450.67'} }\n```",
