In this scenario, the line:\n    - **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: -9100000.00\n   \n- This indicates a decrease in inventory, which can be considered as a reduction in assets held for sale or being manufactured.\n\n### Final Extraction:\nThe relevant value for the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale is **-9100000.00**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNow I can present the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-9100000.00'} }\n```",
