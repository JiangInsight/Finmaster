The figure we are actually seeking here is the change in cash and cash equivalents that can be attributed to operational activities.\n     \n2. **Find Taxes Accrued but Not Yet Paid:**\n   - In the balance sheet, we look for the line item:\n     - **Taxes Payable:** 1015922.54 (This value indicates the amount of taxes that are owed but have not yet been paid).\n\n3. **Determine Total Income from Ordinary Activities:**\n   - In the income statement, we need to find the total revenue, which represents the income that arises in the course of ordinary activities.\n   - From the income statement:\n     - **Total Revenue:** 20318450.67 (This value represents the total income generated during the reporting period).\n     \n4. **Organizing Data:**\n   - We have the following values based on our extraction:\n     - From Cash Flow Statement -> Cash and Cash Equivalents from Operating Activities: **-18924462.44**\n     - From Balance Sheet -> Taxes Accrued but Not Yet Paid: **1015922.54**\n     - From Income Statement -> Total Income from Ordinary Activities: **20318450.67**\n\nFinally, we compile these values into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1015922.54', 'value2': '20318450.67', 'value3': '-18924462.44'} }\n```",
