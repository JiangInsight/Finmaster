However, cash and cash equivalents can be broken down further into \"Cash on Hand\" and \"Bank Deposits\".\n   - Here, the total initial \"Cash on Hand\" is 5,000,000.00 and initial \"Bank Deposits\" are 15,000,000.00.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Cash and Cash Equivalents**: \n   - Total Cash and Cash Equivalents at the beginning of the period can be calculated:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cash and Cash Equivalents} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} = 5,000,000.00 + 15,000,000.00 = 20,000,000.00\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cross-Reference with Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, the \"Beginning Balance\" for cash and cash equivalents is explicitly stated as 20,000,000.00, confirming our calculated value.\n\nGiven this analysis, the value of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period is confirmed to be **20,000,000.00**.\n\nNow we can present the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '20000000.00'} }\n```",
