                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to extract two specific line items from three financial statements: the balance sheet, the cash flow statement, and the income statement. The line items we're interested in are:\n\n1. The end value of funds deposited into a bank (Bank Deposits).\n2. The income earned by the entity from financial assets (Interest Income).\n\nLet's break down the provided financial statements step by step:\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\nFrom the balance sheet, we will look for the \"Bank Deposits\" line item and extract its end amount.\n\n- **Bank Deposits**: The end amount is **385137.69**.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow Statement\nThe cash flow statement does not contain a specific line item for bank deposits or interest income directly. Therefore, we move to the next financial statement.\n\n### 3. Income Statement\nFrom the income statement, we will look for the \"Interest Income\" line item and extract its amount.\n\n- **Interest Income**: The amount is **18176.52**.\n\nNow that we've gathered the required values from the relevant financial statements, we can organize our results accordingly for output.\n\n### Final Extraction\n- Value from **Balance Sheet**: Bank Deposits end amount = **385137.69**\n- Value from **Income Statement**: Interest Income = **18176.52**\n\nIn the required JSON format, the solution can be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '385137.69', 'value2': '18176.52'} }\n```",
