The initial value is 0.00, and the end value is 0.00.\n   - **Taxes Payable**: This account represents amounts owed for taxes. The initial value is 0.00, and the end value is 1,015,922.54.\n\n2. **Initial and End Values Extraction:**\n   - For **Accounts Payable:**\n     - Initial value: 0.00\n     - End value: 0.00\n   - For **Taxes Payable:**\n     - Initial value: 0.00\n     - End value: 1,015,922.54\n\n3. **Determine total amounts owed for goods or services for the final solution:**\n   - The only relevant account in terms of amounts owed for goods or services received is **Taxes Payable**, since **Accounts Payable** remains zero.\n\n4. **Final Values:**\n   - For this task, we will primarily consider **Taxes Payable** as the only relevant account that reflects an amount owed at the end of the reporting period.\n\nNow, gathering the required details:\n- Initial value for Taxes Payable: 0.00\n- End value for Taxes Payable: 1,015,922.54\n\nThus, the solution in the required JSON format will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1015922.54'} }\n```",
