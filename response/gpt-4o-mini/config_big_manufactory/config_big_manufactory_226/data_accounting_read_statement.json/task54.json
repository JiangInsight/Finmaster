                        "content": "To solve the task, I need to identify the specific line item and value related to costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers. Typically, this information is found in the income statement under line items such as \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" as it captures the direct costs directly tied to production and delivery.\n\nLet's analyze the provided financial data:\n\n### Income Statement:\n| Account                   | Amount       | Date       |\n|--------------------------|--------------|------------|\n| Main Business Revenue     | 20318450.67 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue             | 20318450.67 | 2024-02-05 |\n| **Cost of Goods Sold**    | **14600000.00** | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost                | 14600000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit              | 5718450.67  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses    | 1127712.35  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Selling Expenses          | 1325774.90  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation              | 127633.22   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses         | 297417.97   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses            | 2878538.44  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income           | 18176.52    | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax         | 2858088.75  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense               | 1015922.54  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit                | 1842166.21  | 2024-02-05 |\n\nFrom the income statement above, the **Cost of Goods Sold** (COGS) of **14600000.00** is identified as the relevant cost incurred to deliver goods and services to customers.\n\nNo other line item specifically captures the costs directly associated with securing customer orders in this context; hence, COGS is the most appropriate value to report.\n\nTherefore, the solution will be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '14600000.00'} }\n```",
