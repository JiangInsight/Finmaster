However, this doesn't directly indicate the amount sold.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - In the cash flow statement under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities,\" we can see a line item: \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\" with an amount of -9,100,000.00. This indicates that the inventory has decreased by this amount over the reporting period.\n\n3. **Income Statement**: \n   - The income statement shows the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) for the reporting period, which is stated to be 14,600,000.00. This amount represents the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nGiven these observations, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is found in the income statement under the line item for cost of goods sold.\n\nTherefore, the solution will be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '14600000.00'} }\n```",
