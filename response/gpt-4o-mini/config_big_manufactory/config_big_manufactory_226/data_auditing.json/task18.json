The profitability could be determined based on the cost (if provided).\n\n7. **Depreciation20240201002** \n   - Recorded Amount: 81887.42\n   - Feasibility Check: Typically aligns with depreciation transactions.\n   \n8. **Last Sale Error (id: Sale20240130027)**\n   - **Recorded**: \n     - Quantity: 0.0\n     - Amount: 0.0\n     - Payment Status: Unpaid\n     - Calculated Profit: 601220.74 (inconsistently high based on quantity)\n   - **Inconsistency Detected**:\n     - The Recorded Quantity and Recorded Amount are zero, while there is recorded profit, which is illogical.\n     - Should recalculate profit over an expected value; expect amount based on cost or unit price.\n\n### Findings\n\nThe specific error relates to:\n- **Transaction ID**: `Sale20240130027`\n  - **Incorrect Fields**:\n    - `recorded_quantity`: `0.0`, should be `1.0` based on other fields indicating it should reflect an entry.\n    - `recorded_amount`: `0.0`, should reflect its transaction value based on the unit price and expected as `up to a reasonable number, not zero.\n    - `recorded_payment/receipt_status`: `Unpaid` should likely reflect as `Paid` based on context.\n \nTherefore, the expected proper entries can be adjusted as indicated below.\n\n### Solution Setup\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    'Original category': 'Sale',\n    'Recorded category': 'Sale',\n    'Original date': '2024-01-30',\n    'Recorded date': '2024-01-30',\n    'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Paid',\n    'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid',\n    'Original payment_method': 'Cash',\n    'Recorded payment_method': 'Cash',\n    'Original quantity': '1.0',\n    'Recorded quantity': '0.0',\n    'Original price': '64139.55',\n    'Recorded price': '64139.55',\n    'Original receive_method': 'Cash',\n    'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receviable',\n    'Original amount': '128279.10',\n    'Recorded amount': '0.0',\n    'Original tax': '6413.96',\n    'Recorded tax': '0.0',\n    'Original profit': '28279.10',\n    'Recorded profit': '601220.74',\n    'Original Preparer': None,\n    'Recorded Preparer':  None,\n    'Original Approver': None,\n    'Recorded Approver': None,\n    'id': 'Sale20240130027'\n}}\n```\nThis will address inconsistencies based on payment status, quantities, and amounts for logical completeness based on typical transaction rationality.",
