From the provided records, we can identify the tax amounts associated with sales and determine the change in taxes payable.\n\nLet's break down the provided transaction data while focusing on tax-related transactions.\n\n1. **Identifying Tax-Related Transactions:**\n   - We need to look for sales transactions since they have tax amounts associated with them (as shown by the `tax_amount` field).\n   - We will sum the `tax_amount` for all sales to obtain the final tax payable after the transactions.\n\n2. **Initial Taxes Payable:**\n   - Taxes payable initially are generally assumed to be zero unless specified otherwise in the problem. Therefore, we will record `'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00'`.\n\n3. **Final Taxes Payable Calculation:**\n   - We will sum the `tax_amount` from each sale transaction to determine the end value of taxes payable.\n\n### Calculation for Final Taxes Payable\n\nGoing through the transaction data step by step:\n- **Sales Transactions with Tax Amounts:**\n   - Sale20240105004: tax_amount = 73151.62\n   - Sale20240107006: tax_amount = 107979.34\n   - Sale20240108014: tax_amount = 12565.31\n   - Sale20240109001: tax_amount = 3152.97\n   - Sale20240110017: tax_amount = 4822.38\n   - Sale20240115020: tax_amount = 33221.79\n   - Sale20240116027: tax_amount = 57377.80\n   - Sale20240120022: tax_amount = 145.18 \n   - Sale20240122037: tax_amount = 254.24\n   - Sale20240125045: tax_amount = 6247.62\n   - Sale20240126047: tax_amount = 8448.04\n   - Sale20240129054: tax_amount = 11820.86\n   - Sale20240130027: tax_amount = 6413.96\n   \nAdding these amounts together yields:\n- 73151.62 + 107979.34 + 12565.31 + 3152.97 + 4822.38 + 33221.79 + 57377.80 + 145.18 + 254.24 + 6247.62 + 8448.04 + 11820.86 + 6413.96 = 271550.92\n\n### Final Output\nPutting this together, we have:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Taxes Payable End Value': '271550.92'} }\n```",
