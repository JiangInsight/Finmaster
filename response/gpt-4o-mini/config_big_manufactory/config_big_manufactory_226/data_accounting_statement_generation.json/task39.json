data. \n\nWe'll proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Identify all interest receivable records**: These records can be identified by the type column, where the value is \"Interest Receivables.\"\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount from interest receivables**: We will sum up the amounts of all interest receivable entries.\n\n3. **Calculate total unpaid interest receivables**: We will separate the unpaid amounts from the positive amounts, collating them to understand if there are any adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Adjust for decreases**: Any negative values in the interest receivable will indicate a decrease in the expected receivable.\n\n5. **Calculate the net change to derive the final interest receivable**: This will either increase or decrease the balance as reflected on the cash flow statement.\n\nLet's summarize the steps with calculations:\n\n**Step 1: Collect entries for Interest Receivables**\nHere are the entries relevant to interest receivable:\n\n```\n| id               |

interest receivables:\n- Add each of the amounts mentioned above.\n\nThe total is approximately the sum of all positive values. \n\n**Accumulative totals for interest receivable**\n```\nTotal Receivable:\n = 1068 + 925.6*8 + 747.6*5 + 569.6*3 + 480.6*2 + 368.2314*2 + 242.896*3 + 153.896*3 + 5.753 + 14.653 + 64.896 + 145.783 + 137.035 + 34.277\n ≈ 1068 + 7404.8 + 3738 + 1708.8 + 961.2 + 736.4628 + 728.688 + 461.688 + 5.753 + 14.653 + 64.896 + 145.783 + 137.035 + 34.277\n ≈ 8008.474\n```\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Adjustments**\nSince there are no adjustments (like payments) indicated in the problem, we take this as the increase in interest receivable.\n\nThe cash flow statement would reflect with a one-time adjustment and update:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '8008.47'}}\n``` \n\nThe increase is the calculated aggregate; thus, the solution represents the increase in interest receivable due to unpaid amounts as derived from the transactions.",
