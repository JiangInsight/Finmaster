These are typically indicated by cash deposits, bank deposits, and fixed assets recorded as contributions.\n   \n2. **Aggregate Initial Contributions**: \n   - We look at the initial contributions on December 31, 2023, as indicated in the transactions.\n   - The initial contributions provided are:\n     - Cash deposit: **5,000,000**\n     - Bank deposit: **15,000,000**\n     - Fixed Assets: **8,000,000**\n\n   Calculating the total:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Initial Paid-in Capital} = 5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Identify Changes to Paid-in Capital Post-Investments**:\n   - Review the transactions for any deductions or further contributions that affect the total investments. The examples do not indicate further investments or deductions that impact the paid-in capital after the initial amount listed.\n\n4. **Final Capital Contributions**: \n   - After reviewing provided transactions, there seem to be no additional contributions or deductions within the given time frame.\n   \n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Both Initial and Final Paid-in Capital remain as originally evaluated.\n\n### Result\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '28000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '28000000.00'}}\n```",
