                        "content": "To calculate the total liabilities and owner's equity for the provided transactions, we need to review the initial amounts and any subsequent transactions affecting these amounts.\n\n### Steps to calculate:\n\n1. **Initial Totals**:\n   - Cash deposit: 5,000,000.00\n   - Bank deposit: 15,000,000.00\n   - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n\n   Total initial assets = Cash + Bank + Fixed Assets = \\(5,000,000 + 15,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 28,000,000\\)\n\n2. **Liabilities from Purchases and Expenses**:\n   - Purchase of equipment (not paid, recorded as liabilities):\n     - Purchase (1500000) - this entry indicates liability as it's from accounts payable.\n     - Purchase (3000000)\n     - Purchase (1600000)\n     - Purchase (1000000)\n     - Purchase (2000000)\n     - Purchase (3000000)\n     - Purchase (5000000)\n     - Total = \\(1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 1,600,000 + 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 18,100,000\\)\n\n3. **Expenses** - These reduce Owner's Equity:\n   - Administrative Expenses, Sales Expenses, Financial Expenses, Depreciation, etc.\n   - Total of various expense entries amounts to:\n     - 22627.45 + 45745.8 + 46979.81 + 82626.66 + 91203.96 + 63781.14 + 17367.28 + ... (adding each entry continuously) \n    \n   Total expenses = 2,374,504.64 \n\n4. **Sales Revenue Increase to Owner's Equity**:\n   - Sales entries add to owner's equity.\n   - Total income is calculated as sums like:\n     - 1,463,032.36 + 2,159,586.87 + 1,347,685.65 ... (continuing the totals from all sales entries)\n   \n   Total sales revenue = \\(1,463,032.36 + 2,159,586.87 + 1,347,685.65 + ... = 13,421,247.16\\)\n\n5. **Earnings Calculation**:\n   - Net income = Total Sales - Total Expenses = \\(13,421,247.16 - 2,374,504.64 = 11,046,742.52\\)\n\n6. **Final Liabilities Calculation**:\n   - We have the total liabilities to account for which remain constant as outlined while calculating expenses from earlier. Therefore, we need to sum liabilities most notably from purchases which were up for liabilities:\n   - Total liabilities = 18,100,000.00\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Initial Value of Liabilities and Owner's Equity**: \n   \\( 1,000,000 + 3,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 18,100,000.00 \\)\n   \n- **Final Value of Liabilities and Owner's Equity**: \n   This is calculated as the initial value minus total expenses plus net income.\n   Therefore the computation becomes:\n   \\( 28,000,000.00 - 18,100,000 + 11,046,742.52 = 20,393,755.48\\)\n\n### Result:\nFinal calculations yield that:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity Initial Value': '28000000.00', 'Total Liabilities and Owners Equity End Value': '20393755.48'} }\n```",
