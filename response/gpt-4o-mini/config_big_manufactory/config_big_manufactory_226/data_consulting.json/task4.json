                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Total Debt (Total Liabilities)**:\n   - From the balance sheet we need to sum up the total liabilities. In this case, we have:\n     - Total Current Liabilities: 1,015,922.54\n   - Since there are no long-term liabilities specified, we can consider the total liabilities as equal to the total current liabilities. Therefore:\n     - Total Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\n2. **Determine Total Equity (Owner's Equity)**:\n   - From the balance sheet, we need to sum the total ownerâ€™s equity. The specified value is:\n     - Total Owner's Equity: 29,842,166.21\n\n3. **Calculate Debt to Equity Ratio**:\n   - The formula for the Debt to Equity Ratio is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Equity}}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the values we have:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,015,922.54}{29,842,166.21}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Performing the Calculation**:\n   - Calculating the ratio gives:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} \\approx 0.034\n     \\]\n\n5. **Formatting the Result**:\n   - To match the required solution format, round the ratio to two decimal places, which is approximately 0.03.\n\nPutting everything together, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03'}}\n```",
