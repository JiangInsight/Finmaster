                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to calculate three financial ratios based on the provided financial statements: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio. Let's break these down one by one.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities (as there are no non-current liabilities provided)\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n- Total Owner's Equity = 29,842,166.21\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{1,015,922.54}{29,842,166.21} \\approx 0.034\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Net Profit Margin\n\nNet Profit Margin is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n\n- Net Profit = 1,842,166.21\n- Total Revenue = 20,318,450.67\n\nCalculating the net profit margin:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{1,842,166.21}{20,318,450.67} \\times 100 \\approx 9.07\\%\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -18,924,462.44\n- Total Current Liabilities = 1,015,922.54\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{-18,924,462.44}{1,015,922.54} \\approx -18.63\n\\]\n\n### Final Values\n\nNow, we can summarize the calculated ratios.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.03', 'Net Profit Margin': '9.07%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-18.63'}}\n```",
