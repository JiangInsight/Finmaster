Here's a detailed analysis of the entries:\n\n1. **Multiple Entries with the Same ID**: The entries with ID `Sale20240113036`, where 'Sale' is recorded as 'Purchase'. The original field values must be derived from the given rows.\n\n2. **Tax Amounts Are Inconsistent**: \n   - The tax amount for the entry with ID `Sale20240113036` is recorded incorrectly compared to the expected value derived from the other fields. The original tax is $24.90, while it is recorded as $446.30.\n\nAfter analyzing the relevant discrepancies, here's the output detailing the inconsistencies found:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Purchase\",\n    \"Original date\": null,\n    \"Recorded date\": null,\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": null,\n    \"Original payment_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": null,\n    \"Original quantity\": null,\n    \"Recorded quantity\": null,\n    \"Original price\": null,\n    \"Recorded price\": null,\n    \"Original receive_method\": null,\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": null,\n    \"Original amount\": null,\n    \"Recorded amount\": null,\n    \"Original tax\": \"24.90\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"446.30\",\n    \"Original profit\": null,\n    \"Recorded profit\": null,\n    \"Original Preparer\": null,\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": null,\n    \"Original Approver\": null,\n    \"Recorded Approver\": null,\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240113036\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis output reflects the original category, the recorded category, and the discrepancies in the tax amount.
