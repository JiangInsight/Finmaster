We need to focus on this category for the initial and end values.\n  \n    - Starting value (Initial Amount): `8000000.00`\n    - Ending value (End Amount): `11364912.39`\n\n2. **Individual Components of Total Current Assets**:\n   - **Cash on Hand**: Usually realizable funds.\n   - **Bank Deposits**: Cash available in bank accounts.\n   - **Interest Receivable**: Amount expected to be received as interest.\n   - **Accounts Receivable**: Amounts owed to the entity by customers, which will be received during the operating cycle.\n   - **Inventory**: Goods that are to be sold or utilized in production. \n\n### Calculating the total current assets:\nSince we have identified that the sum line items under \"Total Current Assets\" should be considered, we capture and use these values for our result:\n\n- **Initial Total Current Assets**: `8000000.00`\n- **End Total Current Assets**: `11364912.39`\n\nThese values correspond to the entity's total assets that will be converted into cash or used up in operations during standard business activities.\n\n### Solution format:\nWe will present our final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '11364912.39'}}\n```",
