                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify the specific line items from the income statement that reflect the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers. In financial terms, these typically include:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** - This represents the direct costs associated with the production of goods sold by a company. It generally includes costs of materials and labor directly tied to production.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses** - These expenses are related to the costs of selling the products or services, including salaries of sales staff, advertising, and other promotional costs that help secure customer orders.\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided income statement:\n\n```markdown\n| Account                  | Amount     | Date         |\n|------------------------- |------------|--------------|\n| Main Business Revenue    | 851679.79  | 2024-02-04   |\n| Total Revenue            | 851679.79  | 2024-02-04   |\n| Cost of Goods Sold       | 543370.00  | 2024-02-04   |\n| Total Cost               | 543370.00  | 2024-02-04   |\n| Gross Profit             | 308309.79  | 2024-02-04   |\n| Administrative Expenses   | 16566.53   | 2024-02-04   |\n| Selling Expenses          | 12001.12   | 2024-02-04   |\n| Depreciation             | 96479.34   | 2024-02-04   |\n| Financial Expenses        | 4532.17    | 2024-02-04   |\n| Total Expenses            | 129579.16  | 2024-02-04   |\n| Interest Income           | 7775.44    | 2024-02-04   |\n| Profit Before Tax        | 186506.07  | 2024-02-04   |\n| Tax Expense              | 42584.04   | 2024-02-04   |\n| Net Profit               | 143922.03  | 2024-02-04   |\n```\n\nFrom this table, we extract the following values:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: **543370.00**\n- Selling Expenses: **12001.12**\n\nNext, we sum these two amounts to find the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Costs} = \\text{Cost of Goods Sold} + \\text{Selling Expenses}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the total:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Costs} = 543370.00 + 12001.12 = 555371.12\n\\]\n\nFinally, we present our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '555371.12'} }\n```",
