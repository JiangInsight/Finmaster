The value from the Balance Sheet is **16000000.00**.\n  \n- **Accounts Payable**: This represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period. The value from the Balance Sheet is **3333720.00**.\n\n### Step 2: Extracting Values from the Income Statement\n- **Profit Before Tax**: This line item represents the profit or loss for the period before deducting tax expenses. The value from the Income Statement is **186506.07**.\n\n### Step 3: Organizing the Extracted Values\nNow that we have identified and extracted the values as needed:\n\n1. From the Balance Sheet:\n   - Paid-in Capital = **16000000.00**\n   - Accounts Payable = **3333720.00**\n\n2. From the Income Statement:\n   - Profit Before Tax = **186506.07**\n\n### Final Output\nNow we are ready to organize these extracted values into the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '186506.07', 'value3': '3333720.00'}}\n```\n\nThis presentation maintains the order of the line items as specified: starting with the Balance Sheet entries followed by the Income Statement entry.",
