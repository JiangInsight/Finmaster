                        "content": "To solve the problem, I need to extract specific financial information from the provided balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. The two items I am looking for are:\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received**: This typically corresponds to the \"Interest Receivable\" line item on the balance sheet, as well as the \"Interest Income\" line item on the income statement.\n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This will come from the \"Net Increase\" line item in the cash flow statement.\n\nHere's the breakdown for the data extraction:\n\n### 1. From the Balance Sheet:\n- The \"Interest Receivable\" account has an end amount of **7775.44**. This is the amount of interest accrued but not yet received.\n\n### 2. From the Cash Flow Statement:\n- The \"Net Increase\" in the cash and cash equivalents during the period is given as **-4762630.10**. This indicates a decrease in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### 3. From the Income Statement:\n- The \"Interest Income\" line shows **7775.44**, which repeats the end amount for \"Interest Receivable,\" but doesn't change the required values for extraction.\n\nNow, letâ€™s format the extracted values into the required JSON format structure presented in the instruction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7775.44', 'value2': '-4762630.10'}}\n``` \n\nThis solution provides the specified values, structured according to your requirements.",
