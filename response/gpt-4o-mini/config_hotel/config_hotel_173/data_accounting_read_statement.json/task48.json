It is usually the first line item under cash flow from operating activities.\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents the cash payments to acquire long-term assets such as property, plant, and equipment. This is typically found under cash flow from investing activities.\n\nNow, let's extract the relevant data points from the provided cash flow statement:\n\n- From the section \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\":\n  - **Net Profit** is given as **143922.03**.\n\n- From the section \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\":\n  - **Purchase of Fixed Assets** is listed as **251793.02**.\n\nWe now have both items extracted in the required order. Our result will be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '143922.03', 'value2': '251793.02'}}\n```",
