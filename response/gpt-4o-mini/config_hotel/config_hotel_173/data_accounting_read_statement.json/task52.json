This amount is the capital that was contributed by shareholders as of the initial date (2023-12-31).\n   - **End Value**: The end amount for \"Paid-in Capital\" is also recorded as 16,000,000.00 as of the end date (2024-02-04).\n\n3. **Formulate the Solution**:\n   Now that we have both the initial and end values, we can format our findings into the required JSON structure as specified:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '16000000.00', 'end value': '16000000.00'} }\n``` \n\nThis output corresponds to the capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares, indicating it has remained unchanged within the stated period.",
