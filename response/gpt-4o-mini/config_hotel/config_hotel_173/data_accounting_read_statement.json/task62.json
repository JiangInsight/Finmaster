                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to extract three specific line items from the provided financial statements: \n\n1. The amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit (Accounts Receivable).\n2. The financing costs incurred by the enterprise (Financial Expenses).\n3. The cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets (Purchase of Fixed Assets).\n\nWe will look for these line items in the three financial statements: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement.\n\nLet's break down the information given in each of the financial statements:\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\n- **Accounts Receivable**: This represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit.\n  - **End Amount**: 335967.05\n  \nNo other relevant line items for financing costs or cash payments for assets are present in the balance sheet.\n\n### 2. Income Statement\n- **Financial Expenses**: This represents the financing costs incurred by the enterprise.\n  - **Amount**: 4532.17\n\nNo other relevant line items for amounts owed to the entity or cash payments for assets are present in the income statement.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets.\n  - **Amount**: 251793.02\n\nCombining these findings, we can summarize the extracted values:\n- **Accounts Receivable** (amount owed): **335967.05**\n- **Financial Expenses** (financing costs): **4532.17**\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets** (cash payments): **251793.02**\n\nNow, we can format the answer according to the required JSON format. Here is the result:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '335967.05', 'value2': '4532.17', 'value3': '251793.02'}}\n```",
