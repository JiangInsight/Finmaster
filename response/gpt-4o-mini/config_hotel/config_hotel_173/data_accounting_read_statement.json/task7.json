However, based on the table provided, it mainly contains balance sheet items (assets, liabilities, and equity). \n\nIn balance sheets, common expense line items are typically not directly listed; instead, they are reflected through reductions in equity or entries related to accumulated depreciation, retained earnings, or similar line items.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided:\n\n1. **Initial Amounts** are zero for all accounts, indicating that they were not recognized until the current period.\n2. Of particular note is \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which as per accounting principles, is considered an expense as it reflects the allocation of the cost of fixed assets over their useful lives.\n\nAlso, “Retained Earnings” indicates net profits or losses that could be influenced by expenses or revenues, but it is not a direct expense line.\n\nUpon checking the details:\n- For Accumulated Depreciation:\n  - Initial amount: 0.00\n  - End Amount: 96479.34\n\nThis indicates that there was no accumulated depreciation at the start of the period, and it ended with an amount of 96479.34, which represents the amount of depreciation expense that has been recognized for the period.\n\nNo other applicable expense figures are presented in the sample data. Thus, we can proceed to document the findings for “Accumulated Depreciation” as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '96479.34'} }\n```",
