This indicates a tax obligation that the entity needs to pay.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" indicates a change in tax liabilities. However, this does not directly represent the total tax expense or obligation for the reporting period, but it provides context regarding the change in tax liabilities.\n\n3. **Income Statement**:\n   - The line \"Tax Expense\" directly shows the tax expense for the reporting period, which is **42584.04**. This is crucial, as it represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay for the period.\n\nGiven that both \"Taxes Payable\" and \"Tax Expense\" refer to the same amount of **42584.04**, we conclude that the tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period is represented by the \"Tax Expense\".\n\nThus, the value we need to report is **42584.04**.\n\nNow, we format our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '42584.04'} }\n```",
