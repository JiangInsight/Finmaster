The three line items we are looking for are:\n\n1. The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period (this corresponds to the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\").\n2. The acquisition of property, plant and equipment (this corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\").\n3. Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period (this corresponds to \"Beginning Balance\").\n\nNow, let's find these values in the provided cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: \n   - The line item is \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with the amount of **3333720.00**.\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: \n   - The line item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with the amount of **251793.02**.\n\n3. **Beginning Balance**: \n   - The line item is \"Beginning Balance\" with the amount of **8000000.00**.\n\nNow that we have identified the three required values, we can compile them into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3333720.00', 'value2': '251793.02', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
