In financial statements, the carrying amount of inventories sold is typically represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Review the Income Statement:** We will check the provided income statement carefully to locate the relevant line item.\n   \n2. **Identify \"Cost of Goods Sold\":** Looking through the table, we find that there is a line item for \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\n3. **Extract the Value:** The amount associated with \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is noted as 543370.00.\n\n4. **Formatted Answer:** We will format this extracted value in the specified JSON output format.\n\nNow that we've completed these steps, let's present the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '543370.00'} }\n```",
