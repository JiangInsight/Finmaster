From the provided data, we see that it is labeled as \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\".\n\n2. **Identify the Necessary Line Items:**\n   In this section, there are two key line items:\n   - **Beginning Balance:** This indicates the cash value at the start of the period, which is 8,000,000.00.\n   - **Ending Balance:** This shows the cash value at the end of the period, which is 3,237,369.90.\n\n3. **Extract the Ending Balance:**\n   The ending balance is the value we are interested in since it represents the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the reporting period.\n\n4. **Final Decision:**\n   From the extracted data, the ending balance of cash and cash equivalents is 3,237,369.90.\n\nNow, I will format this information according to the instruction given:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3237369.90'} }\n```",
