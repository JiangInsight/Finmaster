This can be derived from summing the end amounts of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable:\n     - End Amount of Accounts Payable: `3333720.00`\n     - End Amount of Taxes Payable: `42584.04`\n     - Total Current Liabilities: `3333720.00 + 42584.04 = 3376304.04` (which matches the stated total).\n\n4. **Prepare final values**:\n   - Initial Total Current Liabilities is `0.00`.\n   - End Total Current Liabilities is `3376304.04`.\n\nNow, we format our findings in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3376304.04'} }\n```",
