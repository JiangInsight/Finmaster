However, in this context, it also aligns with core activities.\n\nNon-operating items found in the statement include:\n- **Interest Income** - Earnings from investments, considered non-core for operating activities.\n- **Profit Before Tax**, **Tax Expense**, and **Net Profit** which summarize overall performance but do not reflect operating income directly.\n\nIn this statement, the relevant line items for core operating activities are:\n- Main Business Revenue: 851679.79\n- Total Revenue: 851679.79\n\nBoth the \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\" are equal in this case, meaning the entity likely has no non-operating revenues impacting overall revenue for the period analyzed.\n\nBased on this information:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '851679.79'}}\n```",
