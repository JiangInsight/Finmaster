This is typically labeled as \"Tax Expense\" or \"Income Tax Expense\".\n\n3. **Extract the tax amount**: Read the value associated with the identified tax line item.\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided income statement:\n\n- The relevant section of the statement shows that thereâ€™s an entry titled \"Tax Expense\" with the value of **42584.04**.\n\nSince this is the line item that represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period, we can conclude our extraction.\n\nFinally, we will format the output according to the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '42584.04'} }\n```",
