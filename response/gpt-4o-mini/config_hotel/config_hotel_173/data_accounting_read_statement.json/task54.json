The two primary costs that are usually associated with the delivery of goods/services to customers are:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** - This represents the total cost incurred by the company to produce the goods that it sold during the period. This includes costs of materials, labor, and direct expenses associated with the manufacturing of the goods.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses** - This includes costs related to selling the goods and securing customer orders, which can encompass sales commissions, advertising, and other promotional costs.\n\nLet's examine the numbers in the income statement:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 543370.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: 12001.12 \n\nNow, adding these two costs together will give us the total costs incurred to secure orders and deliver goods/services to customers:\n\n- Total Costs = COGS + Selling Expenses\n- Total Costs = 543370.00 + 12001.12 = 555371.12\n\nHowever, the problem specifically points to extracting the values separately listed, particularly focusing on the **selling expenses**, as mentioned in the instruction for costs incurred. \n\nThus, extracting the selling expenses value as requested gives:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '12001.12'} }\n``` \n\nThis is the solution to the task, highlighting the cost specifically tied to the selling expenses associated with securing customer orders and delivering goods.",
