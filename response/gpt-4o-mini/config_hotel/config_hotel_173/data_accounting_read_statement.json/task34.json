                        "content": "To solve the problem, we first need to identify the three specific line items from the income statement provided:\n\n1. **Total income arising in the course of an entity’s ordinary activities** – This is represented by \"Total Revenue.\"\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period** – This is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n3. **Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole** – This is represented by \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\nNow, let's extract the values from the income statement for each of these items:\n\n1. The **Total Revenue** amount is found as follows:\n   - \"Total Revenue\" = 851679.79\n\n2. The **Cost of Goods Sold** can be found as follows:\n   - \"Cost of Goods Sold\" = 543370.00\n\n3. The **Administrative Expenses** is listed as follows:\n   - \"Administrative Expenses\" = 16566.53\n\nNow, we compile these values in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '851679.79', 'value2': '543370.00', 'value3': '16566.53'}}\n```",
