Balance Sheet\nFrom the provided Balance Sheet, we need to locate:\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents\n- Taxes Payable (accrued but not yet paid)\n\nThe relevant line items are:\n- **Total Cash and Cash Equivalents**: This is typically considered as the combined amount of cash on hand and bank deposits.\n    - Cash on Hand: 1254762.92\n    - Bank Deposits: 1982606.98\n    - Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 1254762.92 + 1982606.98 = 3237369.90 (As per the cash flow statement, the ending balance also reflects this total)\n\n- **Taxes Payable**: 42584.04\n\n### 2. Income Statement\nFrom the Income Statement, we need:\n- Total Revenue (income arising in the course of ordinary activities)\n    - Total Revenue: 851679.79 \n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, we need:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (cash generated from operating activities)\n    - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4510837.08\n\n### Summary\nNow, let's encapsulate our findings before formatting them into the specified JSON output:\n\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents generated: 3237369.90\n- Taxes Accrued but Not Yet Paid: 42584.04\n- Total Income from Ordinary Activities: 851679.79\n\nI'll group these into the required JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '42584.04', 'value2': '851679.79', 'value3': '-4510837.08'}}\n```",
