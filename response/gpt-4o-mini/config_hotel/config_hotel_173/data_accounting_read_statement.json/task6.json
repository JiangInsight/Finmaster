Here are the relevant line items in the provided balance sheet:\n\n1. **Inventory**: This item qualifies as a tangible asset used in the production or supply of goods or services.\n2. **Fixed Assets**: This item also qualifies as it includes tangible items held for administrative purposes or usage in operations.\n\nNow, let's extract the initial and end values for these items:\n\n1. **Inventory**:\n   - Initial value: 7783800.00\n   - End value: 7783800.00\n\n2. **Fixed Assets**:\n   - Initial value: 8000000.00\n   - End value: 8251793.02\n\nSince the task requires a summary of tangible assets held for use in production or services, we will only consider the Fixed Assets line as it best represents items that are held for use (including equipment, machinery, and properties). \n\nFinally, we will format the selected values as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8251793.02'} }\n```",
