This is typically reflected in the \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" section of a cash flow statement. \n\nLetâ€™s analyze the given cash flow statement step by step:\n\n1. **Look for the relevant line item**: \n   - The relevant line item for the increase in amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit is:\n   ```\n   Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\n   ```\n   \n2. **Identify the value associated with this line item**: \n   - From the provided statement, the value associated with \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" is:\n   ```\n   3333720.00\n   ```\n   \n3. **Prepare the solution in the required JSON format**: \n   - Since we need to present the value in a specific JSON structure, we will format it accordingly.\n\nCombining the analysis above, the final output will be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3333720.00'} }\n```",
