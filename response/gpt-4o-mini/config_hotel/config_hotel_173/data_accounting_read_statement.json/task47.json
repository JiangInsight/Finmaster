The **Net Increase** is already stated in the problem as -4762630.10, which is the alias for \"Net Increase.\"\n\nNow we decompose this value into the two component sub-items which are the **Beginning Balance** and the **Ending Balance**:\n\n- **Sub-item value1**: This corresponds to the Beginning Balance, which is 8000000.00.\n- **Sub-item value2**: This corresponds to the Ending Balance, which is 3237369.90.\n\nNow we can format the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-4762630.10', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '8000000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '3237369.90'}}\n```",
