In the provided income statement, this can be found under the line item labeled \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\n2. **Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period**: This is typically reflected in the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) section, which represents the cost associated with producing or purchasing the goods that were sold during the reporting period.\n\nNow let's extract these values from the income statement:\n\n- From the line item labeled **\"Main Business Revenue,\"** we have:\n  - **Value1:** 851679.79\n\n- From the line item labeled **\"Cost of Goods Sold,\"** we find:\n  - **Value2:** 543370.00\n\nThus, the values we need for the solution are:\n\n- **Value1:** 851679.79 (Main Business Revenue)\n- **Value2:** 543370.00 (Cost of Goods Sold)\n\nFinally, we structure this information in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '851679.79', 'value2': '543370.00'} }\n```",
