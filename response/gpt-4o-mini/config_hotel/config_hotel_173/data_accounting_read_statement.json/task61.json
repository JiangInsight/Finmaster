We will group them as specified.\n\n### Analyzing the Statements\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n   - The balance sheet provides information about the financial position at the end of a given period. However, it does not specifically provide the line items related to cash payments for property, plant, and equipment other than their book values.\n   \n2. **Cash Flow Statement**\n   - In the cash flow statement, we look for cash payments related to capital expenditures or investments.\n     - We see \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" which indicates cash payment made to acquire property, plant, and equipment.\n   \n3. **Income Statement**\n   - The income statement provides details about revenue and costs.\n     - We will look for \"Cost of Goods Sold\" as it represents costs incurred to deliver goods and services to customers.\n\n### Extracting the Values\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: It is listed as **251793.02**.\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: It is listed as **543370.00**.\n\n### Organizing by Financial Statements \n\nWe have:\n1. **Income Statement**\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: **543370.00**\n   \n2. **Cash Flow Statement**\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: **251793.02**\n\n### Final Result Formatting\n\nWe need to format our final values in the required JSON structure. Here are the identified values:\n- value1 corresponds to Cost of Goods Sold.\n- value2 corresponds to Purchase of Fixed Assets.\n\nSo, the final JSON output will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '543370.00', 'value2': '251793.02'} }\n```",
