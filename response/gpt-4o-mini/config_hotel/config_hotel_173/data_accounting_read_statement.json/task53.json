                        "content": "To solve the task of identifying and extracting the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, we need to analyze the provided financial statements: balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement.\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**: \n   - The ending inventory amount is stated as \\( 7,783,800.00 \\). However, this doesn't directly provide information about the inventories sold.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - The cash flow statement indicates that there was an \"Increase (Decrease) in Inventory\" of \\( -7,783,800.00 \\). This suggests that this amount represents a decrease in the inventory, which may imply that this amount has been sold or used during the reporting period.\n\n3. **Income Statement**: \n   - The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) is listed as \\( 543,370.00 \\). This amount reflects the cost of the inventories sold during the reporting period and directly indicates the carrying amount of the inventory that was sold.\n\nBased on the income statement, the value of inventories sold, reflected in the Cost of Goods Sold, is clearly stated as \\( 543,370.00 \\).\n\nNow, we format the answer in the required format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '543370.00'} }\n```",
