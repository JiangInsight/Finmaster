                        "content": "To calculate the Current Ratio and the Inventory Turnover Ratio, we will follow these steps:\n\n### 1. **Calculate the Current Ratio**\n\nThe Current Ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It is calculated by dividing Total Current Assets by Total Current Liabilities.\n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Total Current Assets (End_amount): 11,364,912.39\n- Total Current Liabilities (End_amount): 3,376,304.04\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{11,364,912.39}{3,376,304.04} \\approx 3.37\n\\]\n\n### 2. **Calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio**\n\nThe Inventory Turnover Ratio measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a given period. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\n**Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n\\]\n\nTo compute this, we first need the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and the average inventory. \n\n**From the Income Statement:**\n- Cost of Goods Sold: 543,370.00 \n\n**From the Balance Sheet:**\n- Inventory (End_amount): 7,783,800.00\n- We will assume that the initial inventory before COGS for this period was 0 because it is not provided.\n\nSince we don't have multiple periods of inventory to calculate an average, we will consider the closing inventory as the total inventory for this calculation.\n\n**Substituting the values:**\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{543,370.00}{7,783,800.00} \\approx 0.07\n\\]\n\nHowever, this seems unusually low for a turnover ratio. In practice, a better method might involve assuming the average period of inventory as half of the end inventory (only a rough estimate due to lack of additional data):\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{543,370.00}{\\left(0 + 7,783,800.00 \\right) / 2} = \\frac{543,370.00}{3,891,900.00} \\approx 0.14\n\\]\n\nHowever, notice this still seems low for a ratio usually associated with a business where inventory is often turned over.\n\nAfter re-evaluation, the calculated value appears to be inaccurate. We will calculate as:\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{543,370.00}{\\text{average of current inventory}} = \\frac{543370}{7783800}\n\\]\n\nThis results in 0.07 or a similar low ratio, which indicates a slower moving inventory or conservative estimation. \n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe results are:\n- **Current Ratio:** approximately 3.37\n- **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** approximately 0.07 (considering the practical low estimate from current needs).\n\nPutting the above figures into the JSON structure we have:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '3.37', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.07'}}\n``` \n\nThis provides a clear picture of both liquidity and inventory management based on the financial data given.",
