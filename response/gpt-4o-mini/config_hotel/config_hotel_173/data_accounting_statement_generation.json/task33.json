                        "content": "To calculate the final tax expense for the income statement based on the provided transaction data, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Transactions**: We need to focus on transactions that have an associated `tax_amount`. Those usually arise from sales and purchases but can also affect the overall expenses.\n\n2. **Sum Up the Tax Amounts**:\n   - From the sales, we accumulate the `tax_amount` for each sale transaction.\n   - Aggregate the amounts from other relevant transactions that might involve taxes.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant transactions step by step to sum up the taxes.\n\n### Transactions with Tax Amounts:\n\n1. **Sales Data**:\n   - Many sales transactions have a `tax_amount` that we need to accumulate:\n     - Sale of **Luxury Suite** on `2024-01-02`: Tax = **2118.56**\n     - Sale of **Luxury Suite** on `2024-01-02`: Tax = **1846.84**\n     - Sale of **Banquet Set** on `2024-01-03`: Tax = **252.39**\n     - Sale of **Deluxe Meal Set** on `2024-01-03`: Tax = **206.42**\n     - Sale of **Banquet Set** on `2024-01-04`: Tax = **349.06**\n     - Sale of **Deluxe Meal Set** on `2024-01-04`: Tax = **349.06**\n     - Sale of **Luxury Suite** on `2024-01-13`: Tax = **2196.64**\n     - Sale of **Luxury Suite** on `2024-01-21`: Tax = **2105.71**\n     - Sale of **Deluxe Meal Set** on `2024-02-01`: Tax = **674.51**\n     - Sale of **Standard Room** on `2024-02-02`: Tax = **637.83**\n     - Sale of **Business Room** on `2024-02-04`: Tax = **209.78**\n\n### Calculating Tax Amount:\n\nNow we'll sum up these `tax_amount`s:\n\n1. **Sum of Tax Amounts**:\n   - \\( 2118.56 \\)\n   - \\( + 1846.84 \\)\n   - \\( + 252.39 \\)\n   - \\( + 206.42 \\)\n   - \\( + 349.06 \\)\n   - \\( + 349.06 \\)\n   - \\( + 2196.64 \\)\n   - \\( + 2105.71 \\)\n   - \\( + 674.51 \\)\n   - \\( + 637.83 \\)\n   - \\( + 209.78 \\)\n   \nTotal = \\( 2118.56 + 1846.84 + 252.39 + 206.42 + 349.06 + 349.06 + 2196.64 + 2105.71 + 674.51 + 637.83 + 209.78 =  12869.69 \\)\n\n### Final Tax Expense:\n\nSumming up all the relevant tax amounts gives us a total tax expense of **12869.69**.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Tax Expense': '12869.69'}}\n```",
