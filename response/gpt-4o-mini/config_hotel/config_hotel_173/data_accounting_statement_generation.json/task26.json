Identify the entries that refer to depreciation in the transactions list. In the provided data, they are indicated by their `type` as \"Depreciation\".\n\n2. Extract the value of the `amount` field for each entry identified as depreciation.\n\n3. In this dataset, there are two depreciation entries:\n   - The first depreciation entry (from the past) has an amount of **45741.99** on date **2024-01-01**.\n   - The second depreciation entry (from the new data) has an amount of **50737.35** on date **2024-02-01**.\n\n4. The most recent depreciation entry (the one that should be included in the current income statement) is **50737.35**.\n\n5. Construct the solution in the required format.\n\nBased on the information processed, here's the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '50737.35'} }\n```",
