The starting value is determined by the initial inventory count, followed by adding the purchase values and subtracting the costs associated with sales.\n\n### Steps to Calculate Initial and Final Inventory:\n\n1. **Initial Inventory Calculation**:\n   - Starting value is 0 since inventories are generally not provided at the beginning of the record.\n\n2. **Purchases**:\n   - Find all the purchase records that increase inventory. These typically include entries with the type \"Purchase\".\n\n3. **Sales**:\n   - Find all the sales records that decrease inventory. These generally include entries with the type \"Sale\".\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Inventory Value**:\n   - Add up all the amounts from the \"Purchase\" entries.\n   - Subtract the total cost of goods sold (i.e., the cost associated with \"Sale\" entries based on the quantity sold). \n   - To calculate the cost of goods sold from \"Sale\" entries, identify the cost per unit from related purchase records.\n\n### Data Analysis:\n\nFor the data we have:\n\n#### Initial Inventory:\n- **Inventory Initial Value**: '0.00'\n\n#### Purchase Entries:\n- Total Purchase Amounts:\n  - Purchase20231231001: 790,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231002: 1,495,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231003: 374,400.0\n  - Purchase20231231004: 1,340,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231005: 146,080.0\n  - Purchase20231231006: 444,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231007: 154,500.0\n  - Purchase20231231008: 21,150.0\n  - Purchase20231231009: 34,350.0\n  - Purchase20231231010: 256,080.0\n  - Purchase20231231011: 21,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231012: 95,920.0\n  - Purchase20231231013: 409,500.0\n  - Purchase20231231014: 432,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231015: 39,900.0\n  - Purchase20231231016: 46,550.0\n  - Purchase20231231017: 448,500.0\n  - Purchase20231231018: 525,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231019: 222,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231020: 812,000.0\n  - Purchase20231231021: 249,000.0\n  \nTotal Purchase Amount: \n  (790,000 + 1,495,000 + 374,400 + 1,340,000 + 146,080 + 444,000 + 154,500 + 21,150 + 34,350 + 256,080 + 21,000 + 95,920 + 409,500 + 432,000 + 39,900 + 46,550 + 448,500 + 525,000 + 222,000 + 812,000 + 249,000) \n= **5,090,000.00** \n\n#### Sale Entries:\nFor the Sale entries, we don't have specific costs mentioned but can assume that calculated sales affect the above purchases. \n\nTotal Sales:\n- Total Value from sales doesnâ€™t directly influence our purchase costs but will help infer losses/gains.\n\n### Result Compilation:\n- **Inventory End Value**: 5,090,000.00\n\n### Conclusion:\nNow putting this all together, we can express the result as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Inventory Initial Value': '0.00', 'Inventory End Value': '5090000.00'}}\n```",
