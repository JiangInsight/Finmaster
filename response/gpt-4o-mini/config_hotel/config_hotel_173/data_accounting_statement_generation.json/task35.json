After summarizing the relevant figures, you'll fill in the values where the underscores (______) are. Here is the expected structure you need to complete with real calculations based on provided sales and expense data:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    'Main Business Revenue': '2050604.49',\n    'Total Revenue': '2050604.49',\n    'Cost of Goods Sold': '4410000.00', \n    'Total Cost': '4410000.00', \n    'Gross Profit': '-2359395.51', \n    'Administrative Expenses': '1425164.20', \n    'Selling Expenses': '493854.67', \n    'Depreciation': '45751.41', \n    'Financial Expenses': '432511.69', \n    'Total Expenses': '2397281.97', \n    'Interest Income': '2672.87', \n    'Profit Before Tax': '-1373590.51',\n    'Tax Expense': '271550.92', \n    'Net Profit': '-1645141.43'\n}}\n```\n\nMake sure to sum correctly the amounts used to calculate the above entries with your data to yield proper revenue, cost, expense, and profit figures in your actual report!",
