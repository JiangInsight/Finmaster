We will also note the associated `tax_amount` for each sale.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Tax from Sales**: For all the sales transactions, we will sum the `tax_amount` to calculate the total taxes incurred from sales.\n\n3. **Identify Purchases and Expenses with Tax**: Determine any purchases and expenses that might qualify for tax deductions. In this context, we can consider purchases that may contribute to the tax calculation.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Tax from Purchases and Expenses**: Similarly, sum any `tax_amount` associated with purchases.\n\n5. **Calculate the Change in Tax Payable**: The final step will be to calculate the difference between the total tax from sales and the total tax from purchases and other expenses to obtain the final value of the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\".\n\n---\n\nNow we'll go through the transactions:\n\n1. **Sales Transactions and Tax Amounts**:\n\n- Sale20240102001: tax_amount = 847.13\n- Sale20240102002: tax_amount = 1187.25\n- Sale20240103003: tax_amount = 62.33\n- Sale20240103004: tax_amount = 843.47\n- Sale20240104006: tax_amount = 1336.78\n- Sale20240104007: tax_amount = 1010.53\n- Sale20240105010: tax_amount = 257.68\n- Sale20240105011: tax_amount = 33.66\n- Sale20240105012: tax_amount = 40.43\n- Sale20240105013: tax_amount = 988.08\n- Sale20240106014: tax_amount = 379.58\n- Sale20240107016: tax_amount = 64.48\n- Sale20240107017: tax_amount = 321.1\n- Sale20240107018: tax_amount = 437.65\n- Sale20240108020: tax_amount = 1051.82\n- Sale20240109023: tax_amount = 49.52\n- Sale20240109024: tax_amount = 170.97\n- Sale20240110026: tax_amount = 1795.14\n- Sale20240110027: tax_amount = 671.64\n- Sale20240111030: tax_amount = 49.32\n- Sale20240111031: tax_amount = 213.02\n- Sale20240112034: tax_amount = 12.6\n- Sale20240112035: tax_amount = 141.09\n- Sale20240112036: tax_amount = 269.62\n- Sale20240113037: tax_amount = 26.53\n- Sale20240114041: tax_amount = 693.47\n- Sale20240114042: tax_amount = 292.0\n- Sale20240114043: tax_amount = 664.79\n- Sale20240115044: tax_amount = 80.13\n- Sale20240115045: tax_amount = 356.41\n- Sale20240115046: tax_amount = 694.85\n- Sale20240121063: tax_amount = 62.0\n- Sale20240121064: tax_amount = 753.59\n- Sale20240121065: tax_amount = 174.05\n- Sale20240122067: tax_amount = 1156.78\n- Sale20240122068: tax_amount = 125.03\n- Sale20240123071: tax_amount = 145.83\n- Sale20240123072: tax_amount = 424.62\n- Sale20240123073: tax_amount = 26.14\n- Sale20240124075: tax_amount = 112.49\n- Sale20240124076: tax_amount = 1167.78\n- Sale20240124077: tax_amount = 1894.4\n- Sale20240124078: tax_amount = 82.39\n- Sale20240125079: tax_amount = 1856.58\n- Sale20240125080: tax_amount = 1692.07\n- Sale20240125081: tax_amount = 54.82\n- Sale20240126083: tax_amount = 352.04\n- Sale20240126084: tax_amount = 74.77\n- Sale20240126085: tax_amount = 947.3\n- Sale20240126086: tax_amount = 378.9\n- Sale20240127089: tax_amount = 2023.67\n- Sale20240127090: tax_amount = 693.68\n- Sale20240128092: tax_amount = 665.22\n- Sale20240128093: tax_amount = 444.73\n- Sale20240128094: tax_amount = 398.83\n- Sale20240128095: tax_amount = 34.06\n- Sale20240129096: tax_amount = 219.5\n- Sale20240129097: tax_amount = 105.13\n- Sale20240129098: tax_amount = 719.38\n- Sale20240129099: tax_amount = 838.59\n- Sale20240130101: tax_amount = 42.1\n- Sale20240130102: tax_amount = 198.76\n- Sale20240130103: tax_amount = 75.52\n- Sale20240131105: tax_amount = 497.98\n- Sale20240131106: tax_amount = 12.31\n- Sale20240131107: tax_amount = 124.25\n\n\nThe total expense tax amounts (added for each sale):\n```\n= 847.13 + 1187.25 + 62.33 + 843.47 + 1336.78 + 1010.53 + 257.68 + 33.66 + 40.43 + 988.08 + 379.58 + 64.48 + 321.1 + 437.65 + 1051.82 + 49.52 +\n170.97 + 1795.14 + 671.64 + 49.32 + 213.02 + 12.6 + 141.09 + 269.62 + 26.53 + 693.47 + 292.0 + 664.79 + 80.13 + 356.41 + 694.85 + 62.0 + 753.59 +\n174.05 + 1156.78 + 125.03 + 145.83 + 424.62 + 26.14 + 112.49 + 1167.78 + 1894.4 + 82.39 + 1856.58 + 1692.07 + 54.82 + 352.04 + 74.77 + 947.3 + 378.9\n+ 2023.67 + 693.68 + 665.22 + 444.73 + 398.83 + 34.06 + 219.5 + 105.13 + 719.38 + 838.59 + 42.1 + 198.76 + 75.52 + 497.98 + 12.31 + 124.25\n```\n\nCalculating this gives a total `tax_increase` of 48838.99.\n\n7. **Deduct Tax on Purchases**: \nFor purchases, we do not have any specified tax amounts in the transactions provided, so that portion will be treated as $0.\n\nFinally, the \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" can then be concluded as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '48838.99'}}\n```",
