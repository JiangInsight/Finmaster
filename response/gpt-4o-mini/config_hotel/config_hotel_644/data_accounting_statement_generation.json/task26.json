The transactions include a row labeled as \"Depreciation\" with its corresponding amount.\n\nStep 2: Identify the depreciation row in the transactions. From the provided data, we see two depreciation entries:\n- The first entry:\n  - Amount: 45751.5 (unchanged from the previous example)\n- The second entry:\n  - Amount: 86352.28 (which is the latest amount for the second entry)\n\nStep 3: Based on common accounting practices, income statements will typically include the most recent depreciation calculation. Therefore, the relevant entry to report in the depreciation for the current financial period is the most recent amount listed above.\n\nStep 4: The final depreciation value to report in the income statement should come from the latest entry for depreciation.\n\nFinal value identified: \n- Depreciation: 86352.28\n\nStep 5: Format the solution according to the specified JSON format. \n\nThe final JSON output reflecting the depreciation figure is as follows:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '86352.28'} }\n```",
