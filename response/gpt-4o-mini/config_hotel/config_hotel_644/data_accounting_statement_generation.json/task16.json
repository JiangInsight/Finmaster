The purchases and expenses are operational and do not affect the capital structure.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are no further adjustments to the capital beyond the initial contributions, the paid-in capital remains the same throughout the recorded dataset.\n\nThus, both the initial and ending values of paid-in capital are 16,000,000.\n\nProviding the solution in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '16000000.00'}}\n```",
