                        "content": "To calculate the total non-current assets at the beginning and the end of the reporting period, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Values**: We look at the entries marked as \"Fixed Assets\" as of December 31, 2023. The total non-current assets initial value can be calculated as follows:\n    - Cash deposit: 3,000,000.00\n    - Bank deposit: 5,000,000.00\n    - Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n  \n   Total Initial Non-current Assets = Cash deposit + Bank deposit + Fixed Assets\n   \\[\n   3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 8,000,000.00 = 16,000,000.00\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Updates during the Reporting Period**:\n    - **Purchases of Fixed Assets**: No current fixed asset purchases are noted for the period but only the adjustments for depreciation should be reflected.\n    - **Depreciation**: We see a depreciation entry of 45,751.50 on January 1, 2024. This value must be subtracted from the total non-current assets.\n  \n   Update from Depreciation = Initial Fixed Assets - Depreciation\n   \\[\n   16,000,000.00 - 45,751.50 = 15,954,248.50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Identify End Values**: We then need to calculate the total non-current assets at-ending values:\n    - The new fixed asset purchases until now (if there are any).\n    - Deduct any depreciations again.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Total Non-current Assets after all adjustments, especially as detailed in expenses or other asset purchases reflected after January 01, 2024. This may include other expenditures on fixed asset purchases if recognized until January 31, 2024 (notably check the final purchase amounts).\n    \nGiven the problem does not detail further purchases and only constitutes depreciation adjustments at this moment, we identify the end value post depreciation based on the above calculations.\n\nTherefore:\n- Total Non-current Assets Initial Value: **16,000,000.00**\n- Total Non-current Assets End Value, taking into account the depreciation applied: **15,954,248.50**\n\n### JSON Output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '15954248.50'}}\n```",
