                        "content": "To calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), we need to analyze the purchases and sales entries, especially focusing on the purchase amounts that contribute to the cost of goods sold. \n\n1. **Identify Purchases:**\n   - The purchases that contribute to COGS are specified as the 'amount' associated with each purchase entry.\n   \n2. **Identify Sales:**\n   - Each sale corresponds to a product sold, which links back to the purchase. The 'cost_amount' on sales represents the value of the products sold and must correspond to purchases recorded.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total COGS:**\n   - The COGS is calculated by summing up the 'cost_amount' from all sales, which shows how much was spent on the sold products.\n\nLet's walk through the provided entries:\n\n### Purchases Analysis\nWe extract the relevant purchase entries:\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 809280.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 19650.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 19050.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 639360.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 44850.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 605000.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 75250.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 460800.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 181280.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 448000.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 562000.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 187300.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 218240.0\n- **Purchase** on 2023-12-31: Amount = 399000.0\n\n### Extracting Sales Data\nWe sum up the 'cost_amount' on sales:\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-02: Cost Amount = 11520.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-02: Cost Amount = 14400.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-03: Cost Amount = 750.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-03: Cost Amount = 11520.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-04: Cost Amount = 20000.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-04: Cost Amount = 11520.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-05: Cost Amount = 9000.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-05: Cost Amount = 450.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-05: Cost Amount = 600.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-06: Cost Amount = 2500.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-06: Cost Amount = 5000.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-07: Cost Amount = 8800.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-10: Cost Amount = 3500.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-11: Cost Amount = 1280.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-12: Cost Amount = 1750.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-14: Cost Amount = 10000.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-19: Cost Amount = 1400.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-20: Cost Amount = 2000.0\n- **Sale** on 2024-01-22: Cost Amount = 2700.0\n\n### Sum of the Cost Amounts:\nNow we sum the cost amounts:\n- (11520.0 + 14400.0 + 750.0 + 11520.0 + 20000.0 + 11520.0 + 9000.0 + 450.0 + 600.0 + 2500.0 + 5000.0 + 8800.0 + 3500.0 + 1280.0 + 1750.0 + 10000.0 + 1400.0 + 2000.0 + 2700.0)\n\nThe total is calculated to be: **'4410000.00'**\n\n### Final Output JSON:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '4410000.00'}}\n```",
