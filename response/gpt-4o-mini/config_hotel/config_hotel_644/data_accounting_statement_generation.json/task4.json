Specifically, we will look for sales where the payment method is \"Account Receivable,\" indicating that payment has not yet been received.\n\n### Step 3: Filter Relevant Sales\nWe will identify and sum the amounts from the sales transactions that are designated as accounts receivable.\n\nHereâ€™s a detailed review of the transactions that meet our criteria:\n\n| Sale ID          | Amount   | Payment Method          | Customer ID |\n|------------------|----------|-------------------------|-------------|\n| Sale20240102001  | 16942.60 | Account Receivable      | C007        |\n| Sale20240102002  | 23745.05 | Account Receivable      | C004        |\n| Sale20240103003  | 1246.50  | Account Receivable      | C017        |\n| Sale20240104007  | 20210.64 | Account Receivable      | C011        |\n| Sale20240107019  | 446.66   | Account Receivable      | C003        |\n| Sale20240108020  | 21036.39 | Account Receivable      | C020        |\n| Sale20240108022  | 851.20   | Account Receivable      | C003        |\n| Sale20240109023  | 990.36   | Account Receivable      | C015        |\n| Sale20240109024  | 3419.42  | Account Receivable      | C001        |\n| Sale20240110028  | 1855.11  | Account Receivable      | C013        |\n| Sale20240110029  | 19698.40 | Account Receivable      | C012        |\n| Sale20240111030  | 986.38   | Account Receivable      | C009        |\n| Sale20240113038  | 8465.01  | Account Receivable      | C005        |\n| Sale20240115045  | 7128.21  | Account Receivable      | C006        |\n| Sale20240118053  | 461.80   | Account Receivable      | C009        |\n| Sale20240118054  | 3599.26  | Account Receivable      | C008        |\n| Sale20240123067  | 23135.67 | Account Receivable      | C016        |\n| Sale20240124075  | 2249.84  | Account Receivable      | C009        |\n| Sale20240124076  | 23355.60 | Account Receivable      | C006        |\n| Sale20240125079  | 37131.55 | Account Receivable      | C003        |\n| Sale20240125081  | 1096.36  | Account Receivable      | C017        |\n| Sale20240126084  | 1495.40  | Account Receivable      | C019        |\n| Sale20240129097  | 2102.57  | Account Receivable      | C002        |\n| Sale20240129099  | 16771.85 | Account Receivable      | C014        |\n\n### Step 4: Calculate End Balance\nNow we will sum these amounts:\n\n```plaintext\nAmount =\n16942.60 + 23745.05 + 1246.50 + 20210.64 + 446.66 +\n21036.39 + 851.20 + 990.36 + 3419.42 + 1855.11 +\n19698.40 + 986.38 + 8465.01 + 7128.21 + 461.80 +\n3599.26 + 23135.67 + 2249.84 + 23355.60 + 37131.55 +\n1096.36 + 1495.40 + 2102.57 + 16771.85\n```\n\nThe sum results in:\n\n```plaintext\nTotal = 390666.26\n```\n\n### Step 5: Prepare Final Output\nNow we can prepare the solution in the requested JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Receivable End Value': '390666.26'} }\n``` \n\n### Final Output\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Receivable End Value': '390666.26'} }\n```",
