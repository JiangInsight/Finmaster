However, to keep it simple, we directly note that cash sales will aggregate.\n   - Total cash outflows due to expenses.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   We will summarize and find the final balance so we can determine:\n   - All summed cash inflows from sales and deposits \n   - Less all summed cash outflows from purchases and expenses.\n\nNow, taking all of this into account, our beginning cash balance is finalized at **8,000,000.00**, which is the only initial balance since any transactions thereafter acted upon this balance. The transactions consist of cash inflows and outflows that will affect the next balances but not this initial.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Beginning Balance': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
