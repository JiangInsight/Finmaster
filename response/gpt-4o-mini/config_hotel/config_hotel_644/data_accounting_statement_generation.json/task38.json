These will generally have \"Account Receivable\" as their `receive_method` and may have different `payment/receipt_status` (either Paid or Unpaid).\n\n2. **Identify Receipt Entries:** Determine which entries correspond to cash received against accounts receivable. This could be from sales made earlier and has been recorded as received now.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Accounts Receivable:**\n    - Sum the amounts for sales where the `payment/receipt_status` is \"Unpaid\" (these increase accounts receivable).\n    - Sum the amounts where the `payment/receipt_status` is \"Paid\" (these reduce accounts receivable, as they reflect payments received).\n\n4. **Final Calculation:** \n   - The final amount in accounts receivable is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Accounts Receivable} = \\text{Total Unpaid Sales} - \\text{Total Paid Entries Against Receivables}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's extract and calculate the required figures step by step:\n\n### Extract Sales Transactions\nFrom the transactions provided, let's focus on those labeled as sales:\n\n- **Sales Total Unpaid:**\n  - Sale20240102001: 16942.60\n  - Sale20240102002: 23745.05\n  - Sale20240103003: 1246.50\n  - Sale20240107019: 446.66\n  - Sale20240108020: 21036.39\n  - Sale20240111030: 986.38\n  - Sale20240115045: 7128.21\n  - Sale20240125079: 37131.55\n  - Sale20240125081: 1096.36\n  - Sale20240127089: 40473.35\n  - Sale20240127090: 13873.56\n  - Sale20240129097: 2102.57\n  - Sale20240129099: 16771.85\n  - Sale20240201108: 5115.08\n  - Sale20240201109: 3933.09\n  - Sale20240201110: 660.27\n\nCalculating the sum of the above amounts gives:\n\\[ \nTotal Unpaid Sales = 16942.60 + 23745.05 + 1246.50 + 446.66 + 21036.39 + 986.38 + 7128.21 + 37131.55 + 1096.36 + 40473.35 + 13873.56 + 2102.57 + 16771.85 + 5115.08 + 3933.09 + 660.27 =  179099.99\n\\]\n\n### Extract Paid Transactions\nNow, extract the entries with `payment/receipt_status` as \"Paid\" that correspond to those accounts receivable, but since they are settled:\n- Sale20240103004: 16869.40\n- Sale20240104006: 26735.56\n- Sale20240104008: 636.75\n- Sale20240105011: 673.17\n- Sale20240105012: 808.60\n- Sale20240105013: 19761.63\n- Sale20240106014: 7591.67\n- Sale20240107017: 6421.96\n- Sale20240107018: 8753.02\n- Sale20240108021: 2392.60\n- Sale20240110026: 35902.80\n- Sale20240110027: 13432.88\n- Sale20240111031: 4260.30\n- Sale20240112034: 251.90\n- Sale20240112035: 2821.83\n- Sale20240112036: 5392.38\n- Sale20240113039: 6639.95\n- Sale20240113040: 2855.70\n- Sale20240116048: 2355.52\n- Sale20240116050: 5450.88\n- Sale20240124076: 23355.60\n- Sale20240124077: 37887.90\n- Sale20240124078: 1647.72\n- Sale20240125080: 33841.48\n- Sale20240126085: 20523.42\n- Sale20240126086: 18946.00\n- Sale20240129098: 14387.56\n- Sale20240129100: 496.78\n\nCalculating the total of these amounts gives:\n\\[ \nTotal Paid Entries = 16869.40 + 26735.56 + 636.75 + 673.17 + 808.60 + 19761.63 + 7591.67 + 6421.96 + 8753.02 + 2392.60 + 35902.80 + 13432.88 + 4260.30 + 251.90 + 2821.83 + 5392.38 + 6639.95 + 2855.70 + 2355.52 + 5450.88 + 23355.60 + 37887.90 + 1647.72 + 33841.48 + 20523.42 + 18946.00 + 14387.56 + 496.78 = 276020.38 \n\\]\n\n### Calculate the Change in Accounts Receivable\nNow, substituting the calculated totals into our earlier formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Final Accounts Receivable} = \\text{Total Unpaid Sales} - \\text{Total Paid Entries}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 179099.99 - 276020.38 = -96920.39\n\\]\n\n### Presenting the Solution in the JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable': '-96920.39'} }\n```",
