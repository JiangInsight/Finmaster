Here, I will identify the depreciation entries, their amounts, and summarize them accordingly.\n\n1. **Identifying Depreciation Entries**: We look for the rows where the \"type\" is \"Depreciation\". Upon reviewing the data, I found the following relevant entry:\n\n   - Entry with `id` **Depreciation20240101001** has an amount of **45751.5**.\n   - Entry with `id` **Depreciation20240201002** has an amount of **86352.28**.\n\n2. **Summing Depreciation Amounts**: The total depreciation amounts are as follows:\n\n   - For the first entry: **45751.5**\n   - For the second entry: **86352.28**\n\n   To calculate the total depreciation, we simply sum these two values:\n   \n   Total Depreciation = 45751.5 + 86352.28 = **132103.78**\n\n3. **Formatting Solution**: According to the specified JSON format, we need to present the solution in the required manner. However, I noticed that in the instructions, the example shows only the last depreciation recorded (closest to the end of January). \n\n   Thus, since we are particularly interested in the latest entry for depreciation, I will focus on the amount **86352.28** for the solution since that's the last depreciation recorded.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Depreciation': '86352.28'} }\n```",
