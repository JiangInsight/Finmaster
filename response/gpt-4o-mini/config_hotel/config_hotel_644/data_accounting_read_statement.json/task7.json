It reflects the total depreciation expense incurred over a period.\n\nNow let's analyze the values given:\n- For the **Accumulated Depreciation** account:\n  - Initial Amount: `0.00`\n  - End Amount: `132103.78`\n\nGiven these values, we can now format this information into the required JSON output format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '132103.78'}}\n```",
