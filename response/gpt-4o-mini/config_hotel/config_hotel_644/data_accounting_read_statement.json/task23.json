This is what we are looking for.\n10. **Profit Before Tax**: This is a resultant figure before tax is deducted, does not directly reflect income from financial assets.\n11. **Tax Expense**: This is what is owed in taxes, again not directly related to income from financial assets.\n12. **Net Profit**: This is the final profit of the entity after all expenses and income are accounted, but doesnâ€™t specify income from financial assets.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided items, we found that the only line item that directly refers to income earned from financial assets is:\n\n- **Interest Income**: 6494.02\n\nTherefore, we present the solution as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6494.02'} }\n```",
