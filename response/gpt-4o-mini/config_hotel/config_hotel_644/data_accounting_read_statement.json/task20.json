In this particular example, the value for COGS is given as:\n\n   - COGS = 544970.00\n\nNo other line items specifically indicate a value for inventories sold beyond this. \n\nBased on this analysis, we find that the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is exactly what is reflected in the COGS.\n\nFinally, I will format the answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '544970.00'} }\n```",
