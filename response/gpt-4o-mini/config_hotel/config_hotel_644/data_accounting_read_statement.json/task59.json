In the balance sheet, it has an end amount of:\n     - Interest Receivable: 6494.02\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - Here, we look for `Interest Income`, which is the accumulated interest earned during the period. In the income statement, it registers:\n     - Interest Income: 6494.02 (though we are more interested in the same figure reflected as accrued).\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - In the cash flow statement, we are looking for the `Net Increase` in `Cash and Cash Equivalents`, which reflects the net change during the period. Here, the value is:\n     - Net Increase: -5335190.97\n\nNow, grouping these values based on the required financial statement section:\n\n### Finalizing the Solution:\n- **Interest Accrued but Not Yet Received**: 6494.02 (from Balance Sheet)\n- **Net Addition in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: -5335190.97 (from Cash Flow Statement)\n\nNow we can format the result as per the instruction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6494.02', 'value2': '-5335190.97'} }\n```",
