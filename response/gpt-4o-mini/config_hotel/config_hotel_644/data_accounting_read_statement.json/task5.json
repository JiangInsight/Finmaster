This indicates that there was no inventory at the start of the period specified.\n\n2. **End Values**:\n    - The end value of \"Inventory\" is stated as 7446940.00. This shows the total value of inventory available for sale at the end date provided.\n\n3. **Final Results**:\n   - Therefore, the initial value of Inventory is 0.00 (as at 2023-12-31).\n   - The end value of Inventory is 7446940.00 (as at 2024-02-01).\n\nGiven this information, we can structure our solution accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '7446940.00'} }\n```",
