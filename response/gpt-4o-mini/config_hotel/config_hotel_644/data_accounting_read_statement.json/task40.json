This represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity during the period.\n\n4. **Format the Solution**:\n   - Based on the instruction to present the answer in a specific JSON format, we will encapsulate this value in the required structure.\n\nThus, the solution will be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5596070.00'} }\n```",
