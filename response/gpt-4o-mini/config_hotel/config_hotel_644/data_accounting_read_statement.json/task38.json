                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to extract the line item from the cash flow statement that represents a decrease in amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit during the period. This usually translates to a decrease in accounts receivable, which shows the amount of money owed to the company by its customers for credit sales.\n\nLet's analyze the provided cash flow statement step by step:\n\n1. Look for line items in the provided cash flow statement.\n2. Identify the relevant line item related to the decrease in accounts receivable:\n   - The line item we see is \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable\" which has a value of \"-335639.38\".\n\nThe negative value indicates a decrease in accounts receivable, signifying that less money is owed to the entity than the previous period or that the entity has received payments on credit sales.\n\n3. Since this is the only related line item indicating a decrease in amounts owed, we will take this as our value.\n\nThus, we will present our final answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-335639.38'} }\n```",
