In the balance sheet provided:\n     - Taxes Payable: **41840.70**\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - The line item \"Tax Expense\" represents the tax expense recognized during the reporting period, regardless of whether it's payable at that time. In the income statement provided:\n     - Tax Expense: **41840.70**\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The cash flow statement includes an increase in tax payable which also relates to the cash flow impacts from tax payments. The \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" portion of the cash flow indicates changes between periods, but for total taxes, we focus on the tax expense.\n\nFrom our review:\n- The total amount the entity is expected to pay in taxes during the reporting period, as shown in the tax expense line item, is **41840.70**.\n\nSummarizing:\n- Total Tax Payable (from balance sheet): **41840.70**\n- Total Tax Expense (from income statement): **41840.70**\n\nBoth the balance sheet and income statement indicate that the tax expense for the period is **41840.70**. Now, we present our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '41840.70'} }\n```",
