Balance Sheet:\n   - This statement does not contain any relevant line items related to customer orders' cost or payments for PP&E.\n\n### 2. Cash Flow Statement:\n   - The relevant line item here is:\n      - Purchase of Fixed Assets: **3415664.34**\n\n### 3. Income Statement:\n   - The relevant line item here is:\n      - Cost of Goods Sold: **544970.00**\n\nNow that we have identified the necessary values, we can present them in the requested format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '544970.00', 'value2': '3415664.34'}}\n```",
