We have the following line items from the cash flow statement:\n\n   - **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n     - Purchase of Fixed Assets (which represents cash outflow)\n\n2. The value for \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is reported as:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -3415664.34 (indicating a cash outflow)\n\n3. This amount (-3415664.34) represents the total outflow from investing activities. However, since we need to represent only specific components that led to this net cash flow, we focus on the sub-item:\n\n   - **Sub-Item**: \n     - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 3415664.34\n\nSince the task demands us to provide the net cash flow value as a negative figure and the sub-item value as a positive figure (because it is an outflow), we proceed to structure the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\nHere is the solution formatted according to the instruction:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3415664.34', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '3415664.34'}}\n```",
