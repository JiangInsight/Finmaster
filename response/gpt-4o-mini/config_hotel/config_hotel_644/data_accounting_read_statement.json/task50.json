Here they are in order:\n1. Depreciation: **132103.78**\n2. (Increase) Decrease in Inventory: **-7446940.00**\n3. Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: **-3415664.34**\n4. Net Increase: **-5335190.97**\n\nThe final output in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '132103.78', 'value2': '-7446940.00', 'value3': '-3415664.34', 'value4': '-5335190.97'} }\n```",
