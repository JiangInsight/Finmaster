Start by examining the **Income Statement**:\n   - Look specifically for the line item labeled **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**. This figure represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company, which includes the carrying amount of the inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nFrom the **Income Statement**, we see:\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 544970.00\n\n2. The **Cost of Goods Sold** (COGS) is the relevant line item that indicates the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period. This figure captures the total cost of all goods that were sold, thus representing the carrying value of the items taken out of inventory.\n\nNow, we will format the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '544970.00'} }\n```",
