Here, the amount is -7446940.00, indicating a decrease.\n6. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: Does not relate to asset reduction.\n7. **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**: Not applicable.\n\nAfter evaluating these entries, the relevant line item indicative of the reduction in assets is:\n\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: -7446940.00\n\nTherefore, the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale during this period is reflected in the decrease in inventory amount.\n\nNow, we will present the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-7446940.00'} }\n```",
