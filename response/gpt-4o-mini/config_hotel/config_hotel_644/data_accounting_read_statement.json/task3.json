We start by identifying the accounts related to amounts owed to the entity. In balance sheets, the account that typically reflects amounts owed to the entity for goods or services is called \"Accounts Receivable.\"\n\n2. Next, we look at the \"Accounts Receivable\" line item in the table provided:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for Accounts Receivable is **0.00**.\n   - The \"End_amount\" for Accounts Receivable is **335639.38**.\n\n3. Since we need to provide the initial and final values, we compile the findings:\n   - **Initial_value**: 0.00\n   - **End_value**: 335639.38\n\nThus, we can present the information in the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '335639.38'} }\n```",
