In this case, the relevant line item is:\n   - **Value 1**: `544970.00` (Cost of Goods Sold)\n\n2. **Depreciation**: This refers to the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life. The relevant line item is:\n   - **Value 2**: `132103.78` (Depreciation)\n\n3. **Financial Expenses**: This is related to financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation.
