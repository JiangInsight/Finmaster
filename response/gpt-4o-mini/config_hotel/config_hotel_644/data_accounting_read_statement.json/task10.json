Typically, this will include:\n   - Paid-in Capital\n   - Common Stock or similar line items that indicate shareholder contributions.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and Final Values**: Once the relevant line items are identified, we will extract the corresponding initial and final values from the balance sheet.\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet:\n\n- The line item for \"Paid-in Capital\" is found, showing an initial amount of 16000000.00 on the date 2023-12-31, and an end amount of 16000000.00 on the date 2024-02-01.\n\nThe \"Paid-in Capital\" is the amount contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares, and there are no changes in its value (initial and end value are the same).\n\n3. **Construct the JSON Response**: With the values identified, we now format them as requested in JSON format.\n\nPutting all this information together, our response will look like this:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '16000000.00', 'end value': '16000000.00'} }\n```",
