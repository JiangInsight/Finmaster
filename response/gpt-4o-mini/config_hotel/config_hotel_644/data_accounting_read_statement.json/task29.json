In this problem, the relevant line items to consider are \"Total Revenue\" and \"Main Business Revenue,\" as they typically represent the income from core operational activities.\n\nUpon examining the provided income statement:\n\n1. **Total Revenue**: 836813.79\n2. **Main Business Revenue**: 836813.79\n\nBoth of these line items indicate the same total income arising from the entity's ordinary activities. Therefore, we can identify the total income as 836813.79.\n\nNext, we need to decompose this total into its component sub-items. In this case, the primary sub-item contributing to total revenue is \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\nThus, we need to extract:\n- The value of total income, which is 836813.79.\n- The value and name of its relevant constituent line item, which is \"Main Business Revenue\" with a value of 836813.79.\n\nNow, we will format this information according to the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '836813.79', 'sub_items_main_business_revenue_value': '836813.79'}}\n```\n\nThis structured answer includes both the total income and the breakdown into its primary sub-item.",
