                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify the relevant line items in the income statement that pertain to the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers. Typically, these costs are largely represented by:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This is the primary line item that includes the direct costs of producing goods that have been sold during a specific period.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses**: These expenses may also reflect costs associated with promoting and selling the products or services to customers.\n\nLooking at the income statement provided in the problem:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold** is **544970.00**\n- **Selling Expenses** is **8884.87**\n\nNow, we will add these two items together to ascertain total costs incurred to secure and deliver goods and services:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Costs} = \\text{Cost of Goods Sold} + \\text{Selling Expenses} = 544970.00 + 8884.87 = 553854.87\n\\]\n\nHowever, the final request in the \"solution\" needs only the value of the selling expenses. According to the example provided, it seems we should focus on identifying the selling expenses specifically.\n\nThus, the answer for the solution refers just to the selling expenses:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8884.87'} }\n```",
