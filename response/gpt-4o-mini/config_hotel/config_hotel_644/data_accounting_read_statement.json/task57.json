This amount is usually reflected under liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\n1. **Reviewing the Balance Sheet:**\n   - The balance sheet provided includes several line items. We focus on liability accounts, specifically \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable.\"\n   - The relevant line items from the balance sheet are:\n     - Accounts Payable: 5596070.00\n     - Taxes Payable: 41840.70\n\n2. **Identifying Addition in Amount Owed:**\n   - The primary focus here is on \"Accounts Payable\" because it directly reflects the purchases made on credit.\n   - Accounts Payable increased from 0.00 at the Initial date (2023-12-31) to 5596070.00 at the End date (2024-02-01).\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The line item of interest that indicates goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period is \"Accounts Payable.\"\n   - The value associated with this line item is 5596070.00.\n\nTherefore, the extracted solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5596070.00'} }\n```",
