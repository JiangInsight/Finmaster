This typically includes administrative expenses as well as any other items related to overhead that can be classified under administration.\n\nHereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown from the income statement provided:\n\n1. **Identify Administrative Costs**: Look for line items that detail administrative or management expenses.\n   - From the provided statement, we see:\n     - **Administrative Expenses**: 13300.90\n     - Other related costs like Selling Expenses and Depreciation are more related to selling and asset management rather than general management and administration specifically.\n\n2. **Extract the Value**: The identified administrative expense is 13300.90. This is the only relevant expense line item in the context of general management and administration.\n\n3. **Format the Answer**: According to the specified JSON format, we encapsulate the value as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '13300.90'}}\n```\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '13300.90'}}\n```",
