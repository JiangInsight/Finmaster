This section usually includes a beginning balance, an ending balance, and a net increase or decrease.\n\n2. **Extract the Ending Balance**: The relevant value we are interested in is the \"Ending Balance\" of cash and cash equivalents, which represents the cash available at the end of the specified period.\n\nBased on the provided cash flow statement:\n\n```\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Ending Balance  | 2664809.03 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Net Increase  | -5335190.97 | 2024-02-01 |\n```\n\n- The \"Ending Balance\" is clearly stated as **2664809.03**.\n\nNow we format our answer accordingly:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2664809.03'} }\n```",
