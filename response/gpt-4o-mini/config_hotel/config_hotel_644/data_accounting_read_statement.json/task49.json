The amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period (which corresponds to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\").\n2. The acquisition of property, plant, and equipment (which corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\").\n3. The cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period (which corresponds to \"Beginning Balance\").\n\nHere are the steps to find those values:\n\n1. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable:** \n   - From the cash flow statement, the line item is: \n     - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 5596070.00\n   - The value for this item is **5596070.00**.\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets:**\n   - From the cash flow statement, the line item is: \n     - Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 3415664.34 \n   - The value for this item is **3415664.34**.\n\n3. **Beginning Balance (Cash and Cash Equivalents):**\n   - From the cash flow statement, the line item is: \n     - Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 \n   - The value for this item is **8000000.00**.\n\nNow, I will format these values into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5596070.00', 'value2': '3415664.34', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
