The **recorded_type**, **recorded_date**, **recorded_amount**, **recorded_approver**, **recorded_preparer**, **recorded_payment/receipt_status**, **recorded_cost_per_unit**, **recorded_payment_method**, **supplier_id**, **supplier_name**, **product_id**, **recorded_product_name**, **recorded_quantity**, **recorded_unit_price**, **recorded_receive_method**, **recorded_customer_id**, **recorded_tax_amount**, **recorded_after_tax_amount**, **recorded_cost_amount**, **recorded_profit** fields should exhibit a clear matching or correlation.\n\n2. In the problem set:\n   - **\"Sale20240115045\"** has inconsistencies in:\n     - **Recorded date** is \"2024-01-20\" but expected should align with sales logged earlier.\n     - **Recorded price** is \"2586.22\" but the correct expected price from the information given should be \"2376.07\".\n     - **Recorded amount** is \"8635.33\" versus expected amount should tie back based on the product of unit price and quantity.\n   \n### Deduction\n- The date appears to have been incorrectly recorded as it dates after the recorded sale date.\n- The recorded price doesn't correspond to the entry requirements of other related entries.\n\n### Solution Compilation\nGiven the discrepancies noted, the initial and corrected values can be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"solution\": {\n    \"Original category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Recorded category\": \"Sale\",\n    \"Original date\": \"2024-01-15\",\n    \"Recorded date\": \"2024-01-20\",\n    \"Original payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Recorded payment/receipt_status\": \"Paid\",\n    \"Original payment_method\": \"R001\",\n    \"Recorded payment_method\": \"R001\",\n    \"Original quantity\": \"3\",\n    \"Recorded quantity\": \"3\",\n    \"Original price\": \"2376.07\",\n    \"Recorded price\": \"2586.22\",\n    \"Original receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Recorded receive_method\": \"Account Receviable\",\n    \"Original amount\": \"7128.21\",\n    \"Recorded amount\": \"8635.33\",\n    \"Original tax\": \"51.42\",\n    \"Recorded tax\": \"62.00\",\n    \"Original profit\": \"100.00\",\n    \"Recorded profit\": \"968.34\",\n    \"Original Preparer\": \"Supervisor\",\n    \"Recorded Preparer\": \"Supervisor\",\n    \"Original Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"Recorded Approver\": \"Director\",\n    \"id\": \"Sale20240115045\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\nThis revised entry reflects the necessary adjustments identified from inconsistencies between the recorded values and what would be logically expected based on standardized transactions.",
