                        "content": "To calculate the required financial ratios based on the provided balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement data, let's go through the calculations step by step.\n\n### 1. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis ratio measures how much cash flow from operations is available to cover current liabilities.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the cash flow, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is \\( -1919526.63 \\).  \nFrom the balance sheet, Total Current Liabilities is \\( 5637910.70 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{-1919526.63}{5637910.70} \\approx -0.34\n\\]\n\n### 2. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Liabilities + Total Non-current Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n\\]\n\nTotal Liabilities here are equal to Total Current Liabilities (5637910.70) since there are no non-current liabilities mentioned.  \nTotal Owner's Equity is \\( 16099532.29 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{5637910.70}{16099532.29} \\approx 0.35\n\\]\n\n### 3. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis reflects how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nTotal Revenue is \\( 836813.79 \\) and Total Assets is \\( 21737442.99 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{836813.79}{21737442.99} \\approx 0.0385\n\\]\n\n### 4. Quick Ratio\nThis indicates the ability of a company to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nQuick Assets \\( = \\text{Cash + Bank Deposits + Accounts Receivable + Interest Receivable} = 2105753.37 + 559055.66 + 335639.38 + 6494.02 = 2721842.43 \\)\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{2721842.43}{5637910.70} \\approx 0.48\n\\]\n\n### 5. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio assesses the ability to pay current liabilities with cash generated from operations.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nUsing Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities of \\( -1919526.63 \\) and Total Current Liabilities of \\( 5637910.70 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-1919526.63}{5637910.70} \\approx -0.34\n\\]\n\n### 6. Return on Equity (ROE)\nThis measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholders' equity.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Return on Equity (ROE)} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\times 100\n\\]\n\nNet Profit is \\( 99532.29 \\) and Total Owner's Equity is \\( 16099532.29 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{ROE} = \\frac{99532.29}{16099532.29} \\times 100 \\approx 0.62\\%\n\\]\n\n### 7. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis indicates how effectively a firm manages its receivables.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\nTotal Revenue is \\( 836813.79 \\) and Accounts Receivable is \\( 335639.38 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{836813.79}{335639.38} \\approx 2.50\n\\]\n\n### Final Results\nNow we can compile these calculations into the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.34',\n    'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35',\n    'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.0385',\n    'Quick Ratio': '0.48',\n    'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.34',\n    'Return on Equity (ROE)': '0.62%',\n    'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '2.50'\n}}\n```",
