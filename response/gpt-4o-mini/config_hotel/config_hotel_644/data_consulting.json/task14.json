                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we need two key pieces of information: **Net Credit Sales** and **Average Accounts Receivable**. The formula for the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Determine Net Credit Sales\nIn this case, we can assume that all Main Business Revenue from the income statement is considered as credit sales since no specifics about cash or credit sales are provided.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Main Business Revenue = 836813.79**\n\nTypically, we would subtract returns, allowances, and discounts from total revenue to get net credit sales. However, since no details are provided regarding returns or discounts, we will use the total revenue as the net credit sales.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Credit Sales} = 836813.79\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Average Accounts Receivable\nThe average accounts receivable is calculated using the beginning and ending balances of accounts receivable. In this case:\n- **Beginning Accounts Receivable** (from the balance sheet) = 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n- **Ending Accounts Receivable** (from the balance sheet) = 335639.38 (as of 2024-02-01)\n\nThe formula for average accounts receivable is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0.00 + 335639.38}{2} = \\frac{335639.38}{2} = 167819.69\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nNow we can calculate the turnover ratio using the values obtained:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{836813.79}{167819.69} \\approx 4.98\n\\]\n\n### Final Step: Present the Answer\nWe round the ratio to two decimal places for presentation.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '4.98'} }\n```",
