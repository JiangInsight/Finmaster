                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: This amount can be found in the cash flow statement. The Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is given directly.\n\n2. **Identify Total Debt**: We will compute Total Liabilities from the balance sheet. This typically consists of Total Current Liabilities and any long-term liabilities, but we will consider just the total current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable) for this calculation.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: This is done using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n#### 1. Extracting Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nFrom the cash flow statement, we find:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** = -1,919,526.63\n\n#### 2. Extracting Total Liabilities (Debt)\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Accounts Payable** = 5,596,070.00\n- **Taxes Payable** = 41,840.70\n- Total Current Liabilities = 5,596,070.00 + 41,840.70 = 5,637,910.70\n\nAssuming there's no long-term debt present (as it wasn't provided), Total Debt = Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70.\n\n#### 3. Calculation of the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nUsing the values obtained:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-1,919,526.63}{5,637,910.70}\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} \\approx -0.34\n\\]\n\n### Final Output\nIn summary, we computed the values needed and calculated the ratio correctly. Now, we can present the answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.34'}}\n```",
