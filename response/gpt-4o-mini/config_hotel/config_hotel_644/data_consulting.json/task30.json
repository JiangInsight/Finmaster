                        "content": "To calculate the required financial ratios based on the provided financial statements, we need to extract relevant data from the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement.\n\n### Step 1: Gathering Data\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n- **Total Current Assets (as of 2024-02-01)**: 10,453,882.43\n- **Total Current Liabilities (as of 2024-02-01)**: 5,637,910.70\n- **Total Assets (as of 2024-02-01)**: 21,737,442.99\n- **Total Liabilities**: Since we only need current liabilities for the current ratio, we'll just use current liabilities here unless specified.\n- **Total Owner's Equity (as of 2024-02-01)**: 16,099,532.29\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Ratios\n\n1. **Current Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{10,453,882.43}{5,637,910.70} \\approx 1.85\n   \\]\n\n2. **Quick Ratio**:\n   To calculate the quick ratio, exclude inventory from current assets.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Total Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory} = 10,453,882.43 - 7,446,940.00 = 3,006,942.43\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{3,006,942.43}{5,637,910.70} \\approx 0.53\n   \\]\n\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   We calculate total liabilities as current liabilities in this case as no long-term liabilities are provided.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Liabilities} = 5,637,910.70\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{5,637,910.70}{21,737,442.99} \\approx 0.26\n   \\]\n\n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} = \\frac{5,637,910.70}{16,099,532.29} \\approx 0.35\n   \\]\n\n5. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   From the cash flow statement, the net cash flow from operating activities can be approximated as:\n   - Calculating the negative net cash flow gives us a net profit which we'll consider here due to no other cash flow info for liabilities.\n   - Cash flow from operating activities (just looking for the negative net profit) gives us an annualized measure. We use net cash flows directly in estimating this.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}} = \\frac{-1919526.63}{5,637,910.70} \\approx -0.34\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Presenting the Final Ratios\n\nAfter completing the calculations, we summarize them in the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Current Ratio': '1.85', 'Quick Ratio': '0.53', 'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.34'}}\n```",
