                        "content": "To solve this task, we need to calculate the three financial metrics requested: Debt to Equity Ratio, Net Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio. Here's how we approach each calculation step-by-step using the provided financial statements.\n\n### Step 1: Data Extraction\n\n1. **Total Liabilities**\n   - From the balance sheet:\n     - Total Current Liabilities = 5,637,910.70\n\n2. **Total Ownerâ€™s Equity**\n   - From the balance sheet:\n     - Total Owner's Equity = 16,099,532.29\n\n3. **Net Profit**\n   - From the income statement:\n     - Net Profit = 99,532.29\n\n4. **Total Revenue**\n   - From the income statement:\n     - Total Revenue = 836,813.79\n\n5. **Operating Cash Flow from Operating Activities**\n   - From the cash flow statement:\n     - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -1,919,526.63 (this figure represents the total operating cash flow, which includes adjustments for changes in working capital)\n\n### Step 2: Calculations\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio**:\n   - Formula: \\( \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}} \\)\n   - Calculation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{5,637,910.70}{16,099,532.29} \\approx 0.350\n     \\]\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin**:\n   - Formula: \\( \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100 \\)\n   - Calculation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{99,532.29}{836,813.79} \\times 100 \\approx 11.91\\%\n     \\]\n   - Note: We will keep it as a percentage representation.\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**:\n   - Formula: \\( \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \\)\n   - Calculation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{-1,919,526.63}{5,637,910.70} \\approx -0.340\n     \\]\n\n### Step 3: Final Formatting\n\nNow, we will present our calculations in the required JSON format. The calculated values may be rounded to two decimal places. \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.35', 'Net Profit Margin': '11.91%', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.34'} }\n``` \n\nThis provides a clear and accurate representation of the requested metrics based on the given financial statements.",
