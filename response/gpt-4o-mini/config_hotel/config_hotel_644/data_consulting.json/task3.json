From the problem provided:\n   - Total Assets = 21737442.99\n\n2. **Identify Total Liabilities**: We need to calculate the total liabilities, which generally consists of current liabilities. From the provided balance sheet data, the total current liabilities account directly reflects liabilities in this context.\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 5637910.70\n\n3. **Calculate Total Liabilities**: In this case, we will assume that total liabilities equal the total current liabilities (no long-term liabilities provided in the data):\n   - Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 5637910.70\n\n4. **Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio**: This ratio can be calculated using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{5637910.70}{21737442.99}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform the Calculation**:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = 0.2597 \\quad (\\text{approximately to four decimal places})\n   \\]\n\n6. **Format the Result**: We will present the result in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.26'}}\n``` \n\nThis concludes the calculation and formatting of the Debt to Asset Ratio based on the provided balance sheet data.",
