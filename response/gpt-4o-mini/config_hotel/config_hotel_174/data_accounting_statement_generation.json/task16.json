The relevant transactions from the provided data are:\n\n1. **Cash Deposit** - $3,000,000.00\n2. **Bank Deposit** - $5,000,000.00\n3. **Fixed Assets** - $8,000,000.00\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the initial total paid-in capital\nWe then sum these initial contributions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial Paid-in Capital} = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 8,000,000 = 16,000,000\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine any changes to paid-in capital\nNext, we check for any transactions that would affect the Paid-in Capital. This includes any purchases and expenses that do not affect the initial investment.\n\nUpon reviewing the subsequent transactions in the list, we find that there are purchases and expenses, but none of these transactions directly imply an increase or decrease in paid-in capital, as they usually involve day-to-day operations, such as sales or expenditures.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the ending paid-in capital\nGiven that no entries influence the paid-in capital from the time of the initial calculation, the ending paid-in capital remains the same as the initial:\n\n\\[\n\\text{End Paid-in Capital} = 16,000,000\n\\]\n\n### Final Output\nThe final values for paid-in capital at the beginning and end according to the calculations above are:\n- **Paid-in Capital Initial Value**: $16,000,000.00\n- **Paid-in Capital End Value**:  $16,000,000.00\n\nThus, the JSON output will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '16000000.00'}}\n```",
