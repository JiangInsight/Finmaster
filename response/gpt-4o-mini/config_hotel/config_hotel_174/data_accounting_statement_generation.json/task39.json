These transactions will reflect the interest accrued and when they are marked as unpaid.\n\n2. **Calculate Net Change**: We'll sum the amounts for all interest receivable transactions. Positive amounts represent interest that has been accrued (unpaid interest, which is an increase), while negative amounts will represent decreases in interest receivable.\n\n3. **Provide the Result**: Finally, we'll output the net change in the requested JSON format as specified.\n\n### Step-by-step Extraction and Calculation\n\n1. **Transaction Records**:\n   The relevant transactions related to \"Interest Receivables\" are:\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-01**: 445.0 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-02**: 445.0 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-03**: 445.0 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-04**: 313.28 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-05**: 313.28 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-06**: 245.3552 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-07**: 245.3552 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-08**: 215.18419999999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-09**: 215.18419999999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-10**: 215.18419999999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-11**: 215.18419999999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-12**: 215.18419999999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-13**: 215.18419999999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-14**: 132.50396272999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-15**: 132.50396272999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-16**: 132.50396272999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-17**: 132.50396272999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-18**: 132.50396272999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-19**: 132.50396272999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-20**: 132.50396272999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-21**: 132.50396272999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-22**: 132.50396272999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-23**: 132.50396272999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-24**: 132.50396272999998 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-25**: 6.377925119999985 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-26**: 6.377925119999985 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-27**: 6.377925119999985 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-28**: 6.377925119999985 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-29**: 6.377925119999985 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-30**: 6.377925119999985 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-01-31**: 6.377925119999985 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-02-01**: 6.377925119999985 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-02-02**: 6.377925119999985 (Unpaid)\n   - **Transaction on 2024-02-03**: 6.377925119999985 (Unpaid)\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Interest Receivable**:\n   The calculations of the different interest receivable amounts yield:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Interest Receivable} = 445 + 445 + 445 + 313.28 + 313.28 + 245.3552 + 245.3552 + 215.18419999999998*6 + 132.50396272999998*11 + 6.377925119999985*6\n   \\]\n   Performing the addition would yield:\n\n   Summing these values, we get:\n\n   - \\(3 \\times 445 = 1335\\)\n   - \\(2 \\times 313.28 = 626.56\\)\n   - \\(2 \\times 245.3552 = 490.7104\\)\n   - \\(11 \\times 132.50396272999998 = 1457.5435860209997\\)\n   - \\(6 \\times 6.377925119999985 = 38.26755071999991\\)\n  \nCombining all these yields approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total} \\approx 1335 + 626.56 + 490.7104 + 1457.5435860209997 + 38.26755071999991 \\approx 3971.10\n\\]\n\n3. **Final Output**:\n   The total interest receivable as discussed should be formatted accordingly in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '3971.10'}}\n```",
