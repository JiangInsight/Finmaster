Here's how we proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identification of Sales Records**: We need to go through each sale entry and collect the `tax_amount` associated with each sale.\n\n2. **Sum of Tax Amounts**: We will sum up all the `tax_amount` values to compute the total tax collected.\n\n3. **Calculation of Final Tax Expense**: The tax expense includes direct costs associated with sales. Also, deductions or adjustments from repayable or unpaid sales are essential to understand. We will not subtract or add for unpaid sales since those do not affect the cash flow until settled.\n\n4. **Final Output**: Compute the total and display it in the specified format.\n\n### Step-by-Step Processing\n\nHereâ€™s a summary of the transactions to aggregate and calculate:\n\n- **Sales Transactions**:\n    - Extract `tax_amount` from the following sales:\n        - Sale20240102002: Tax Amount: 76.67\n        - Sale20240102003: Tax Amount: 25.84\n        - Sale20240103004: Tax Amount: 807.22\n        - Sale20240103005: Tax Amount: 150.95\n        - Sale20240103006: Tax Amount: 718.56\n        - Sale20240104008: Tax Amount: 34.19\n        - Sale20240104009: Tax Amount: 1890.52\n        - Sale20240105011: Tax Amount: 54.37\n        - Sale20240105012: Tax Amount: 46.4\n        - Sale20240105013: Tax Amount: 772.19\n        - Sale20240105014: Tax Amount: 177.43\n        - Sale20240106017: Tax Amount: 546.76\n        - Sale20240106018: Tax Amount: 258.05\n        - Sale20240106019: Tax Amount: 406.38\n        - Sale20240106020: Tax Amount: 49.42\n        - Sale20240109027: Tax Amount: 1751.61\n        - Sale20240109028: Tax Amount: 245.74\n        - Sale20240111032: Tax Amount: 92.83\n        - Sale20240111033: Tax Amount: 213.37\n        - Sale20240112036: Tax Amount: 1319.07\n        - Sale20240112037: Tax Amount: 353.26\n        - Sale20240112038: Tax Amount: 503.24\n        - Sale20240112039: Tax Amount: 170.96\n        - Sale20240113040: Tax Amount: 131.94\n        - Sale20240115045: Tax Amount: 117.21\n        - Sale20240115046: Tax Amount: 1066.38\n        - Sale20240122065: Tax Amount: 177.61\n        - Sale20240122066: Tax Amount: 158.5\n        - Sale20240124069: Tax Amount: 116.17\n        - Sale20240124070: Tax Amount: 499.69\n        - Sale20240124071: Tax Amount: 237.63\n        - Sale20240125073: Tax Amount: 262.13\n        - Sale20240125074: Tax Amount: 2108.3\n        - Sale20240125075: Tax Amount: 420.12\n        - Sale20240126076: Tax Amount: 1296.88\n        - Sale20240126077: Tax Amount: 685.48\n        - Sale20240127081: Tax Amount: 707.18\n        - Sale20240127082: Tax Amount: 237.02\n        - Sale20240129086: Tax Amount: 141.71\n        - Sale20240129087: Tax Amount: 61.2\n        - Sale20240131091: Tax Amount: 731.52\n        - Sale20240131092: Tax Amount: 290.23\n        - Sale20240131093: Tax Amount: 258.61\n        - Sale20240201095: Tax Amount: 856.11\n        - Sale20240201096: Tax Amount: 770.61\n        - Sale20240201097: Tax Amount: 276.29\n\n- **Calculation**:\n   - Total Tax Amount: \n     - 76.67 + 25.84 + 807.22 + 150.95 + 718.56 + 34.19 + 1890.52 + 54.37 + 46.4 +\n     - 772.19 + 177.43 + 546.76 + 258.05 + 406.38 + 49.42 + 1751.61 + 245.74 +\n     - 92.83 + 213.37 + 1319.07 + 353.26 + 503.24 + 170.96 + 131.94 + 117.21 +\n     - 1066.38 + 177.61 + 158.5 + 116.17 + 499.69 + 237.63 + 262.13 + 2108.3 +\n     - 420.12 + 1296.88 + 685.48 + 707.18 + 237.02 + 141.71 + 61.2 +\n     - 731.52 + 290.23 + 258.61 + 856.11 + 770.61 + 276.29 =\n     - **= 10243.80**\n\n### Final Result\n\nBased on the summation of all tax amounts from the sales transactions, we have:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Tax Expense': '10243.80'}}\n```",
