We can summarize the total liabilities from the balance sheet as follows:\n- Accounts Payable: \\(3350120.00\\)\n- Taxes Payable: \\(39599.66\\)\n- Total Current Liabilities: \\(3389719.66\\)\n\nSince total liabilities are indicated as part of the total assets, and we know that:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity\n  \\[\n  19501451.49 - 16111731.83 = 3399720.00\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio Calculation\nNow we can calculate the ratio:\n- Amount of Debt = \\(3399720.00\\)\n  \nUsing the values we found, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-4504752.68}{3399720.00}\n\\]\n\n### Calculation\nCalculating this:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} \\approx -1.32\n\\]\n\nPutting together the solution in the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.32'}}\n```",
