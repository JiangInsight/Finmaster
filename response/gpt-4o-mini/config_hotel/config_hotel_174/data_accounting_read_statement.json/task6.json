We'll look for specific line items related to fixed assets and inventory, as they generally fit this criterion.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, the relevant line items are:\n1. **Fixed Assets**: This usually includes property, plant, and equipment necessary for the production or supply of goods.\n2. **Inventory**: This consists of goods that are held for production or sale.\n\nNow, let's extract the initial and end values for these items:\n\n- **Fixed Assets**:\n  - Initial Amount: 8000000.00\n  - End Amount: 10496137.92\n\n- **Inventory**:\n  - Initial Amount: 0.00\n  - End Amount: 7869940.00\n\nNext, we will focus on the values that represent tangible assets for production/supply. In this case, both Fixed Assets and Inventory are indeed applicable.\n\nNow, calculate the total initial value and end value for all the identified tangible assets:\n\n- **Total Initial Value**: 8000000.00 (Fixed Assets) + 0.00 (Inventory) = 8000000.00\n- **Total End Value**: 10496137.92 (Fixed Assets) + 7869940.00 (Inventory) = 18366077.92\n\nPresenting the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '18366077.92'} }\n```",
