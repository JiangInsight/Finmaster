For \"Interest Receivable\", the initial amount is **0.00**.\n   - **End Amount**: This is the value at the end date (2024-02-03) of the period defined in the balance sheet. For \"Interest Receivable\", the end amount is **5264.70**.\n\n3. **Final Values**:\n   - Initial amount of interest accrued but not yet received: **0.00**\n   - Final amount of interest accrued but not yet received: **5264.70**\n\nHaving gathered all the required information, here is the solution in the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5264.70'} }\n```",
