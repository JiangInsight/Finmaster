                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to extract two specific line items from three financial statements: the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement. The two line items we are focusing on are:\n\n1. **Interest accrued but not yet received** (typically found in the Balance Sheet as \"Interest Receivable\" and the Income Statement as \"Interest Income\").\n2. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period** (which can be found in the Cash Flow Statement typically under \"Net Increase\" or similar terms).\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided statements step by step:\n\n### Analyzing the Balance Sheet\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Interest Receivable**:  \n  The end value of **Interest Receivable** is **5264.70**.\n\n### Analyzing the Income Statement\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Interest Income**:  \n  The value for **Interest Income** is **5264.70** as it represents the income from interest that is accrued but not yet received.\n\n### Analyzing the Cash Flow Statement\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**:  \n  The value for the **Net Increase** (or decrease) in cash and cash equivalents is **-7000890.60**. Since it denotes a decrease, the amount is negative.\n\n### Collating the Values\nNow that we have identified the values:\n- **Value from Interest Receivable (Interest Accrued)**: **5264.70**\n- **Value from Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: **-7000890.60**\n\nWe format our output to match the required structure in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5264.70', 'value2': '-7000890.60'}}\n```",
