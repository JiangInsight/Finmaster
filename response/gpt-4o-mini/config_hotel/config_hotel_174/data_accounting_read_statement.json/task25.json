In this case, COGS is clearly mentioned.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses**: These are costs incurred to secure customer orders, such as advertising and sales force expenses. This is relevant for costs associated with selling and delivering goods and services to customers.\n\nAfter reviewing the income statement:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 504930.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: 9828.84\n\nTo get the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services, we sum these two line items:\n\nTotal Costs = Cost of Goods Sold + Selling Expenses  \nTotal Costs = 504930.00 + 9828.84  \nTotal Costs = 514758.84\n\nNext, we will output this total in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '514758.84'} }\n```",
