The structure indicates that the \"Ending Balance\" line is correctly presented.\n\n4. **Prepare the solution**:\n   We identify the value for the ending balance of cash and cash equivalents as '999109.40'.\n\nThus, the final answer will be formatted as per the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '999109.40'} }\n```",
