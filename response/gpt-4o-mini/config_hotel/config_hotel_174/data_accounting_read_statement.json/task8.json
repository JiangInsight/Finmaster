The primary accounts that indicate amounts owed are \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\".\n\nLet's analyze these accounts:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**:\n   - **Initial Amount**: 0.00\n   - **End Amount**: 3,350,120.00\n\n2. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - **Initial Amount**: 0.00\n   - **End Amount**: 39,599.66\n\nNow, we identify the total owed amount at the end and the initial balances.\n\n### Initial Values:\n- Accounts Payable: 0.00\n- Taxes Payable: 0.00\n\n### End Values:\n- Accounts Payable: 3,350,120.00\n- Taxes Payable: 39,599.66\n\n### Calculating the Overall Amount Owed:\n- **Total Initial Value = Initial Accounts Payable + Initial Taxes Payable**\n  - Total Initial Value = 0.00 + 0.00 = 0.00\n- **Total End Value = End Accounts Payable + End Taxes Payable**\n  - Total End Value = 3,350,120.00 + 39,599.66 = 3,389,719.66\n\nThe total value amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit can be neatly summarized as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3350120.00'}}\n```\n\nNote: In context of the original question and example, the response only captures the end value of the significant amount owed namely Accounts Payable.",
