                        "content": "To solve the problem, I need to extract two specific line items from the provided financial statements: 1) the end value of bank deposits and 2) the income earned by the entity from financial assets (which in this case is captured under interest income). There are three financial statements to analyze: the Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, and Income Statement. The output should group these items by financial statement in a specified order.\n\nLet's go through the provided financial data step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Balance Sheet\nFrom the balance sheet, we look for the line item \"Bank Deposits\":\n- Line Item: **Bank Deposits**\n- End Amount: **71662.08**\n\nNext, we check if there is any line item related to \"income earned from financial assets\" in the balance sheet. There is not. So we'll move to the next statement.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Cash Flow Statement\nThe cash flow statement typically does not have the line items we're looking for. It mainly contains operational data and cash transactions. There are no relevant items regarding deposits or income from financial assets here.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Income Statement\nNow looking at the income statement, we check for the line item \"Interest Income\":\n- Line Item: **Interest Income**\n- Amount: **5264.70**\n\n### Step 4: Compile the Results\nNow we gather our findings:\n- From the Balance Sheet, the end value of the bank deposits is **71662.08**.\n- From the Income Statement, the income earned from financial assets is **5264.70**.\n\n### Final Result Construction\nWe need to return these values in the required JSON format as follows:\n- value1: the end value of the bank deposits\n- value2: the income from financial assets (interest income)\n\nThe final output will be:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '71662.08', 'value2': '5264.70'}}\n``` \n\nThis solution encapsulates the required data in the appropriate format.",
