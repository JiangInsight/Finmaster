Both indicate the same amount.\n   - **Revenue = 791992.51**.\n\n2. **Identify the Cost**:\n   - The cost is represented under \"Cost of Goods Sold\" or \"Total Cost\". Again, both yield the same amount.\n   - **Cost = 504930.00**.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference**: \n   - To find the difference (which represents the gross profit), we subtract the cost from the revenue:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost} = 791992.51 - 504930.00 = 287062.51.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, based on the calculations, we have identified the value of the difference as 287062.51.\n\nNow, formatting the result into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '287062.51'} }\n```",
