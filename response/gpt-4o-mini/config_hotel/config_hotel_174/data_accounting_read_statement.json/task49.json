The required line items are:\n\n1. The amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period (which corresponds to \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\").\n2. The acquisition of property, plant, and equipment (which corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\").\n3. The cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period (which corresponds to \"Beginning Balance\").\n\nNow, let's extract the values step-by-step from the provided cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: The provided statement indicates the following:\n   - Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable: 3350120.00\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The statement indicates:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 2496137.92\n\n3. **Beginning Balance**: The statement shows:\n   - Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n\nBased on this information, we can compile the values as follows:\n\n- Value1 (Increase in Accounts Payable): 3350120.00\n- Value2 (Purchase of Fixed Assets): 2496137.92\n- Value3 (Beginning Cash and Cash Equivalents): 8000000.00\n\nNow that we have identified and extracted the necessary values, we can represent the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '3350120.00', 'value2': '2496137.92', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
