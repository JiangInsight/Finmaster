These typically include cash, accounts receivable, and inventory, which are essential for daily operations and are expected to be converted to cash or consumed.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Current Assets**: We need to review the line items that are classified as current assets. Based on the provided balance sheet:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - Inventory\n   \n2. **Calculate Total Current Assets**: The “Total Current Assets” has an *initial value* of 8,000,000.00 as of 2023-12-31 and an *end value* of 9,122,854.19 as of 2024-02-03.\n\n3. **Extract Values**:\n   - **Initial Amount**: 8,000,000.00\n   - **End Amount**: 9,122,854.19\n\nNow we can format the result in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '9122854.19'} }\n```",
