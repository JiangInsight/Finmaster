This figure represents the costs directly attributed to the production of goods that were sold during the specified period.\n\nGiven that \"Cost of Goods Sold\" encompasses the costs of securing customer orders (in terms of production costs) and delivering those goods, we will extract this value.\n\nThus, the identification and extraction of the cost incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers can be summarized as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '504930.00'} }\n```",
