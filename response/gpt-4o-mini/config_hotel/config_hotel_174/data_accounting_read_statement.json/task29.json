In this case, the only sub-item that derives from the income statement is \"Main Business Revenue.\" \n\n4. **Record Initial and Final Values**: \n   - Initial value for the sub-item (\"Main Business Revenue\"): 791992.51 (this value is equal to the Total Revenue since it's the same in this case).\n   - Final value for the sub-item is also 791992.51 as there are no adjustments or further decomposition required.\n\nNow, let's compile these findings into a JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '791992.51', 'sub_items_main_business_revenue': '791992.51'}}\n```",
