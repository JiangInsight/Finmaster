In this case, the relevant amounts are:\n     - Cash on Hand = 927447.32\n     - Bank Deposits = 71662.08\n   - Total cash and cash equivalents at the end date is calculated as:\n     - Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits\n     - Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = 927447.32 + 71662.08 = 999109.40\n\n2. **Income Statement**\n   - We need to identify the total income arising in the course of the entityâ€™s ordinary activities, which includes:\n     - Main Business Revenue = 791992.51\n     - Total Revenue = 791992.51\n   - These values are the same, so we can use this single figure for total income.\n   - Taxes accrued but not yet paid, found in the tax expense:\n     - Tax Expense = 39599.66\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**\n   - We are looking for cash flow from operating activities, which gives us:\n     - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -4504752.68\n\n### Final Values\nWe will compile the numbers extracted:\n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents** = 999109.40\n- **Taxes Accrued** = 39599.66\n- **Total Income** = 791992.51\n\n### Solution Formatting\nNow, we can format these values into the required JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '39599.66', 'value2': '791992.51', 'value3': '999109.40'} }\n``` \n\nThis captures all the required information in the specified structure.",
