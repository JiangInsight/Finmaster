Therefore, the appropriate cost for management and administration would be captured in \"Administrative Expenses.\"\n\nNow, let's ensure we've captured the data correctly: \n\n- The line item \"Administrative Expenses\" directly represents the general costs associated with management and administration of the entity, which amounts to **10432.67**.\n\nPutting this together, the solution format requested is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '10432.67'} }\n```",
