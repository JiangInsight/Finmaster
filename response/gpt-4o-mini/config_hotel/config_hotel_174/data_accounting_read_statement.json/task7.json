These represent assets, liabilities, and equity rather than direct expenses.\n\n3. **Reviewing for Expense Trends**:\n   - The only accounts that may imply a transfer or impact on expense in the provided data are \"Accumulated Depreciation\" and \"Taxes Payable\".\n   - \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" while a contra asset account, signifies the aging and usage of fixed assets, which leads inevitably to expense through depreciation.\n\n4. **Calculating Values**:\n   - For the \"Accumulated Depreciation\":\n     - **Initial Amount**: 0.00\n     - **End Amount**: 117540.62\n\n5. **Formulating the Solution**:\n   - As we have determined, the relevant account for extracting expenses appears to be \"Accumulated Depreciation.\" We will record its initial and final values accordingly.\n\nThus, we can summarize our findings in the desired JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '117540.62'}}\n```",
