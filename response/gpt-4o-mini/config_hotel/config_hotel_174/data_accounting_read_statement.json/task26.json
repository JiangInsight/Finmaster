The accounts listed include:\n   - Financial Expenses\n   - Interest Income\n   - Main Business Revenue\n   - Cost of Goods Sold, etc.\n\n2. The relevant line item that reflects financing costs is:\n   - **Financial Expenses**, which in this case amounts to **3193.59**.\n\n3. There are no other line items listed that would explicitly represent financing costs incurred for raising funds.\n\nThus, based on the provided data, we conclude that the value of financing costs is the amount listed under Financial Expenses.\n\nHere is the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3193.59'} }\n```",
