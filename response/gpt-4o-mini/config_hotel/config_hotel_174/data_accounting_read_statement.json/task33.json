The value of income arising in the course of the entity's core operating activities, which is represented by \"Main Business Revenue\".\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nLet's go through the income statement step by step and identify the necessary values:\n\n- **Main Business Revenue:** This is the amount that represents the income from primary business activities. Looking through the statement, we see:\n  - Main Business Revenue = **791992.51**\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold:** This reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the entity. In the statement, the relevant entry is:\n  - Cost of Goods Sold = **504930.00**\n\nNow, compiling these values according to the required format, we set:\n\n- **value1** (Main Business Revenue): **791992.51**\n- **value2** (Cost of Goods Sold): **504930.00**\n\nThus, the completed JSON object with the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '791992.51', 'value2': '504930.00'} }\n```",
