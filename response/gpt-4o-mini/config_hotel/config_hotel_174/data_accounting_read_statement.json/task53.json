In this case, the value for COGS is **504930.00**.\n   - The **cash flow statement** also shows an entry: `(Increase) Decrease in Inventory`, which has the value of **-7869940.00**. This indicates a decrease in inventory on hand during the reporting period.\n\n2. **Determination of Inventory Sold**:\n   - The inventory sold during the period is reflected in the COGS figure on the income statement. \n   - The cash flow figure concerning inventory serves to illustrate the overall changes in inventory levels but does not directly indicate the cost of inventory that was sold.\n\nBased on the information provided:\n\n- The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, as indicated by the COGS line item, is **504930.00**.\n\nThus, the final response is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '504930.00'} }\n```",
