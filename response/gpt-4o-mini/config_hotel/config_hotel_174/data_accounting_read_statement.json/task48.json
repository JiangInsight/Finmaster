The \"Net Profit\" which indicates the profit an entity retains after all expenses have been deducted from total revenue.\n2. The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" which represents cash payments made to acquire long-term assets.\n\nLet's extract the information step by step from the provided cash flow statement:\n\n- From the section \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\", we find:\n  - **Net Profit**: 111731.83\n\n- From the section \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", we find:\n  - **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 2496137.92\n\nNow we will assign these values to our solution structure:\n\n- For **value1** which corresponds to \"Net Profit\", we will use '111731.83'.\n- For **value2** which corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\", we will use '2496137.92'.\n\nNow, we present the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '111731.83', 'value2': '2496137.92'} }\n```",
