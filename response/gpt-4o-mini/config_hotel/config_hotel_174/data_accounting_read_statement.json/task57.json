The key line items that typically indicate amounts owed for goods or services purchased on credit are:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**: This represents obligations to pay suppliers for goods and services received that are not yet paid for. \n\n2. **Taxes Payable**: This represents amounts owed for taxes that have been incurred but not yet paid.\n\nGiven the data in the balance sheet:\n\n| Account           | Initial_amount | Initial_date | End_amount   | End_date   |\n|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|------------|\n| Accounts Payable   | 0.00            | 2023-12-31    | 3350120.00   | 2024-02-03 |\n| Taxes Payable      | 0.00            | 2023-12-31    | 39599.66     | 2024-02-03 |\n\nFrom the above, the only line item that directly relates to the amount owed for goods or services is **Accounts Payable** with an end amount of **3350120.00**.\n\nNow we shall set this value as the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '3350120.00'} }\n```",
