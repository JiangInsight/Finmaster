                        "content": "To extract the required values from the given financial statements, we need to look for two specific line items across three financial statements: \n\n1. Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers. This is typically found in the Income Statement and is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).\"\n  \n2. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets. This is found in the Cash Flow Statement and is indicated as \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Financial Statements\n\n#### Balance Sheet\nThe relevant line items are not present for our requirements. The balance sheet primarily provides asset, liability, and equity details, not operational costs or cash payments for assets.\n\n#### Income Statement\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: The line item here indicates costs associated with the production of goods sold by the company. In this case, it is **504930.00**.\n\n#### Cash Flow Statement\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This line item indicates cash outflows for acquiring property, plant, and equipment. In this case, it is **2496137.92**.\n\n### Step 2: Compile the Values\nBased on our findings:\n- For the Income Statement, the relevant value for costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers (COGS) is **504930.00**.\n- For the Cash Flow Statement, the relevant value for cash payments to acquire long-term assets is **2496137.92**.\n\n### Final Step: Formatting the Output\nWe will compile the results in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '504930.00', 'value2': '2496137.92'} }\n``` \n\nThis output succinctly provides the values of interest from the financial statements as required.",
