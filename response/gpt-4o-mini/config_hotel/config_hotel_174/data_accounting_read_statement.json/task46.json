Our goal is to identify the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from activities involving long-term asset acquisition or disposal, as well as interest and dividends.\n\n### Breakdown of the Cash Flow Statement:\n1. **Operating Activities:**\n    - The key figures here are related to operating activities, but they are not relevant for our specific task regarding investing activities.\n    \n2. **Investing Activities:**\n    - The relevant line item we have is:\n        - **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 2496137.92 (This represents cash outflow which is negative.)\n    - The **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities** is calculated as:\n        - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: -2496137.92\n\n3. **Cash and Cash Equivalents:**\n    - Though cash and cash equivalents show the beginning balance, ending balance, and net increase, these do not directly relate to our specific extraction from the investing activities.\n\n### Analysis\nTo find the solution:\n- We identify the value of net cash flow from investing activities, which is a negative value, indicating cash outflow due to the purchase of fixed assets.\n- The cash outflow specifically related to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" will be categorized as our sub-item.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the extracted information:\n- The cash flow generated from the activities of acquisition and disposal of long-term assets shows a net outflow of -2496137.92.\n- The sub-item detailing the cash outflow from the purchase of fixed assets stands at 2496137.92.\n\nCombining the findings, we will structure the solution accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2496137.92', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '2496137.92'}}\n```",
