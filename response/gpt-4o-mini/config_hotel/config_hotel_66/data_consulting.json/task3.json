For the end of the reporting period:\n   - Total Assets = 21,662,106.19\n\n2. **Total Liabilities**: This can be inferred from the total current liabilities and any other entries that might involve liabilities. For this balance sheet:\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 5,515,978.61\n   - There are no additional liabilities mentioned, so Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities.\n\nThus, Total Liabilities = 5,515,978.61.\n\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio Formula**: \n   - Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n\n4. **Substituting Values**:\n   - Debt to Asset Ratio = 5,515,978.61 / 21,662,106.19\n\n5. **Calculating the Ratio**:\n   - Debt to Asset Ratio â‰ˆ 0.254 (when calculated)\n\nLastly, we can present the result rounded to two decimal places in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.25'} }\n```",
