                        "content": "To solve for the Debt to Asset Ratio and Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio based on the provided financial statements, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Calculate Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Total Assets** = 21662106.19\n- **Total Current Liabilities** (Total Liabilities in this provided financial statement) = 5515978.61\n\nThus, the **Total Liabilities** = 5515978.61. \n\nNow, we can calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{5515978.61}{21662106.19} = 0.2545 \\]\n\nTo express it in a more standard form, we'd present it as a ratio rounded to two decimal places:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = 0.25 \\]\n\n### 2. Calculate Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** = -2419019.09 (which is a negative number)\n- **Net Income** = 146127.58\n\nUsing these figures:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-2419019.09}{146127.58} = -16.56 \\]\n\nAgain, we express this rounded to two decimal places. Here, we keep the negative to signify that cash flows are negative relative to the net income:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = -16.56 \\]\n\n### Final Results\n\nNow we compile the results into a JSON formatted output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.25', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-16.56'}}\n```",
