                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: From the cash flow statement, the net cash flow from operating activities is given as:\n   - **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -2419019.09\n\n2. **Calculate Total Debt**: Total debt is usually the sum of current liabilities and long-term liabilities. From the balance sheet, we see:\n   - **Total Current Liabilities**: 5515978.61 \n   - There are no long-term liabilities explicitly stated, so we will consider just the current liabilities for this calculation.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**: The formula for the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   In this case, the Total Liabilities is equal to the Total Current Liabilities, which we previously identified as 5515978.61.\n\nNow substituting the values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-2419019.09}{5515978.61}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this value step-by-step:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} \\approx -0.4387\n\\]\n\nSince we are often required to present the ratio with two decimal points, this becomes approximately -0.44.\n\nThus, wrapping it in the required json format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.44'} }\n```",
