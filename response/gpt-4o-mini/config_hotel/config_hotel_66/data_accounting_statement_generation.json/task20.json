                        "content": "To create the balance sheet from the provided transaction data, we will summarize the initial and ending values for each of the relevant accounts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\n1. **Initial Values**:\n   - **Cash on Hand**: The value from the initial cash deposit is $3,000,000.\n   - **Bank Deposits**: The initial bank deposit value is $5,000,000.\n   - **Interest Receivable**: Initially, there are no interest receivables recorded.\n   - **Accounts Receivable**: Similarly, there are no accounts receivable noted at the beginning.\n   - **Inventory**: No inventory is mentioned initially.\n   - **Total Current Assets**: Sum of cash on hand, bank deposits, interest receivables, accounts receivable, and inventory.\n   - **Fixed Assets**: Initial value is $8,000,000 (from the transactions indicating initial fixed assets).\n   - **Accumulated Depreciation**: $0 as this is the initial point.\n   - **Total Non-current Assets**: Fixed assets minus accumulated depreciation.\n   - **Total Assets**: Total current assets and total non-current assets combined.\n   - **Accounts Payable**: No liabilities initially noted, thus $0.\n   - **Taxes Payable**: No taxes payable noted, hence $0. \n   - **Total Current Liabilities**: Sum of accounts payable and taxes payable.\n   - **Paid-in Capital**: Equals total assets initially ($13,000,000).\n   - **Retained Earnings**: $0 initially as there are no previous earnings recorded.\n   - **Total Owner's Equity**: Paid-in capital plus retained earnings.\n   - **Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity**: Total current liabilities plus total owner’s equity.\n\n2. **Ending Values** (after all transactions):\n   - Calculate each component affected by transactions (sales, purchases, expenses, etc.)\n   - Update cash, bank deposits, accounts receivable, interest receivables, inventory, fixed assets, accrued depreciation, accounts payable, and retained earnings.\n   - Finally, derive total current assets, total non-current assets, total assets, total current liabilities, and update the total owner’s equity then total liabilities and owner’s equity.\n\n### Calculated Values:\n\n- **For Initial Values**:\n  - Cash on Hand: $3,000,000\n  - Bank Deposits: $5,000,000\n  - Interest Receivable: $0.00\n  - Accounts Receivable: $0.00\n  - Inventory: $0.00\n  - Total Current Assets: $8,000,000\n  - Fixed Assets: $8,000,000\n  -
