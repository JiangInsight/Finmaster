Typically, investing activities include purchases and sales of fixed assets, investments, and any other transactions related to the long-term assets.\n\nFrom the provided dataset, we will classify the transactions:\n\n1. **Cash Inflows from Investing Activities:** \n   - Sale of fixed assets (if any)\n   - Cash received from selling investments\n\n2. **Cash Outflows from Investing Activities:**\n   - Purchase of fixed assets\n   - Investments made in other companies or various assets\n\nNow let's analyze the provided transactions to extract the necessary data:\n\n1. **List of Investing Activities:**\n   - **Fixed Assets Purchases:**\n     - Purchase of Fixed Assets: $8,000,000.0\n     - Purchase of Banquet Set: $371,520.0\n     - Purchase of Banquet Set: $829,440.0\n     - Other purchases which will not be classified as investing activities based on the variable types.\n   - **Investing Activity Outflows**:\n     - Total purchases = $8,000,000 + $371,520 + $829,440 = $9,200,960.0\n\n2. **Cash Inflows from Selling Fixed Assets:**\n   - The primary dataset does not indicate any cash inflows from selling fixed assets.\n\nFollowing this, the Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities can be computed as:\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities:** \n  \\[\n  = \\text{Total Cash Inflows} - \\text{Total Cash Outflows}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 0 - 9,200,960.0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = -9,200,960.0\n  \\]\n\nNow, we can format this result into the required output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities': '-9200960.0'}} \n```",
