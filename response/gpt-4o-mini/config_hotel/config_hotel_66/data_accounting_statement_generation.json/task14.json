The key indicators for current liabilities in the provided data are entries that indicate unpaid purchases and accounts payable.\n\nI will proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Liabilities**:  \n   - According to the first part of the provided transactions, there are no outstanding liabilities at inception (initial point) as all transactions are marked as either deposits or asset purchases. Thus,\n     - Total Current Liabilities Initial Value: **0.00**\n\n2. **End Liabilities Calculation**:  \n   - Next, I will check for any unpaid purchases which will count as current liabilities.\n\n### Unpaid Purchases and Liabilities:\n- **Check for Unpaid Purchases**:\n  1. **Purchase20231231002**: Amount **829440.00** (Unpaid)\n  2. **Purchase20231231004**: Amount **1250000.00** (Unpaid)\n  3. **Purchase20231231008**: Amount **254320.00** (Unpaid)\n  4. **Purchase20231231009**: Amount **36050.00** (Unpaid)\n  5. **Purchase20231231012**: Amount **35850.00** (Unpaid)\n  6. **Purchase20231231015**: Amount **59850.00** (Unpaid)\n  7. **Purchase20231231024**: Amount **402000.00** (Unpaid)\n  8. **Purchase20231231018**: Amount **328000.00** (Unpaid)\n\n### Summing Up Unpaid Liabilities:\n- Total of unpaid purchases:\n  - 829440.00 + 1250000.00 + 254320.00 + 36050.00 + 35850.00 + 59850.00 + 402000.00 + 328000.00 = **3,158,610.00**\n\nSo, the final total current liabilities will be **3,158,610.00**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nPutting it all together, we get:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '3158610.00'} }\n```",
