In the given data, there are purchases and expenses occurring, but there's no indication of new capital inflows or withdrawals, nor any capital restructuring that would affect the paid-in capital explicitly indicated in the transactions.\n\nBased on the transactions shown, it appears that the Paid-in Capital remains unchanged because:\n\n- No additional contributions were made by equity holders.\n- No withdrawals or dividends from the capital were noted.\n\nThus, assuming the Paid-in Capital remains unchanged from its initial setting throughout the further transactions, we conclude:\n\n- Final Paid-in Capital = Initial Paid-in Capital = **16,000,000**\n\nHence, our answer will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '16000000.00'}}\n```",
