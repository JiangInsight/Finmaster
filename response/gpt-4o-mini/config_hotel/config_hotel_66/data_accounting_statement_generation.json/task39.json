We have both positive and negative values for various interest receivables.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n1. **List All Interest Receivables**: Extract the values of all interest receivable transactions. Here are the relevant entries from the provided data:\n\n   - Initial Interest Receivable: 411.93\n   - Interest on January 2, 2024: 408.82\n   - Interest on January 3, 2024: 408.82\n   - Interest on January 4, 2024: 357.02\n   - Interest on January 5, 2024: 357.02\n   - Interest on January 6, 2024: 335.64\n   - Interest on January 7, 2024: 316.42\n   - Interest on January 8, 2024: 316.42\n   - Interest on January 9, 2024: 316.42\n   - Interest on January 10, 2024: 316.42\n   - Interest on January 11, 2024: 316.42\n   - Interest on January 12, 2024: 243.37\n   - Interest on January 13, 2024: 316.42\n   - Interest on January 14, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 15, 2024: 243.37\n   - Interest on January 16, 2024: 243.37\n   - Interest on January 17, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 18, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 19, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 20, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 21, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 22, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 23, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 24, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 25, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 26, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 27, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 28, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 29, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 30, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on January 31, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on February 1, 2024: 240.16\n   - Interest on February 1, 2024: 240.16\n\n2. **Sum Up All Interest Receivables**:\n   We calculate the total by adding all the amounts mentioned above. Since there's no specific notice of a write-off, we simply sum them up.\n\n3. **Final Calculation**: \n   The steps would yield an accumulated total of interest and finally provide any adjustments needed to derive the \"Increase/Decrease in Interest Receivable.\" \n\n   The final total comes to **-2672.87**\n\n### Solution Format\nNow we format the solution according to the provided JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '-2672.87'} }\n```",
