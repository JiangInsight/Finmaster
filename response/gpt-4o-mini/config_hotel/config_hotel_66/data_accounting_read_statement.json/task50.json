Let's analyze the cash flow statement item by item:\n\n1. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is represented by \"Depreciation\".\n   - From the statement, the value is **91509.94**.\n\n2. **Reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, in production for such sale, or in the process of being manufactured during the period**: This can be identified as the \"Increase (Decrease) in Inventory\".\n   - From the statement, the value is **-7832820.00**.\n\n3. **Net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from an entity's activities that are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents**: This corresponds to \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\".\n   - From the statement, the value is **-0.00** (since it mentions \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" as 0.00).\n\n4. **Net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period**: This is represented by \"Net Increase\".\n   - From the statement, the value is **-2419019.09**.\n\nNow, organizing these values according to their respective order in the original cash flow statement, we get:\n\n- value1 (Depreciation): **91509.94**\n- value2 (Decrease in Inventory): **-7832820.00**\n- value3 (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities): **-0.00**\n- value4 (Net Increase): **-2419019.09**\n\nHereâ€™s the final JSON formatted solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '91509.94', 'value2': '-7832820.00', 'value3': '-0.00', 'value4': '-2419019.09'}}\n```",
