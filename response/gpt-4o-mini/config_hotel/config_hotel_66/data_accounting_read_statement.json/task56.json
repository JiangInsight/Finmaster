Among these, the \"Depreciation\" line item is primarily found in the cash flow and income statements, reflecting the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount.\n\n2. **Locate Depreciation in Income Statement:**\n   - We look at the income statement section where \"Depreciation\" is listed. It shows:\n     ```plaintext\n     | Depreciation | 91509.94 | 2024-02-01 |\n     ```\n   - This indicates that the amount allocated as depreciation for this period is **91509.94**.\n\n3. **Confirm Amount in Cash Flow Statement:**\n   - In the cash flow statement, we also find a line that specifically states \"Depreciation\":\n     ```plaintext\n     | Depreciation  | 91509.94 | 2024-02-01 |\n     ```\n   - This confirms the amount as consistent with what was found in the income statement.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, represented under \"Depreciation\" in both financial statements, is **91509.94**.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\nNow, we can format this final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '91509.94'}}\n```",
