Cash held by the entity available for use in its day-to-day operations.\n2. Tangible items that are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services (referred to as Inventory).\n3. Amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid.\n\nWe will find these line items in the balance sheet and record their initial and end amounts:\n\n1. **Cash Held for Day-to-Day Operations:**\n   - **Cash on Hand:** \n     - Initial Amount: 3000000.00\n     - End Amount: 2882590.91\n     \n   - **Bank Deposits:** \n     - Initial Amount: 5000000.00\n     - End Amount: 2698390.00\n\n2. **Tangible Items Held for Production or Supply (Inventory):**\n   - **Inventory:** \n     - Initial Amount: 0.00\n     - End Amount: 7832820.00\n\n3. **Amount of Tax Accrued but Not Yet Paid:**\n   - **Taxes Payable:** \n     - Initial Amount: 0.00\n     - End Amount: 43168.61\n\nBased on the instructions, we will output the values from the balance sheet in the specified format while maintaining the original order of the line items listed:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '3000000.00', 'end valu1': '2882590.91', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '7832820.00', 'initial value3': '0.00', 'end valu3': '43168.61'} }\n```",
