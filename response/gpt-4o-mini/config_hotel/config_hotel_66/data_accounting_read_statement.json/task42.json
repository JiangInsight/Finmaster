The cash payments for acquiring PPE will typically fall under the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" section.\n\n2. **Locate Line item**: Within the \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", we look for the line item that specifically indicates the purchase of fixed assets. In this cash flow statement, we see the following entry:\n   - Purchase of Fixed Assets: **0.00**\n\n3. **Determine Value**: Since the value listed for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" is 0.00, this indicates there were no cash payments made to acquire property, plant, and equipment during this period.\n\n4. **Formulate Solution**: Based on the information gathered, we can conclude that there are no cash payments for acquiring PPE, and we will format this result as specified.\n\nNow we will present our answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '0.00'} }\n```",
