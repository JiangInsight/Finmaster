The main revenue arising from core operating activities, which is reflected in the \"Main Business Revenue\" line item.\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which is represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item.\n\nLetâ€™s analyze the given income statement:\n\n- **Main Business Revenue** is listed as **863371.65**. This represents the total income from the business's core operations.\n- **Cost of Goods Sold** is listed as **562950.00**. This represents the costs directly associated with the goods sold during the reporting period.\n\nNow we will compile the values into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '863371.65', 'value2': '562950.00'}}\n```",
