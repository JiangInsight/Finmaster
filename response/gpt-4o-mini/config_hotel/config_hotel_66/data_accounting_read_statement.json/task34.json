Total income arising in the course of the entity's ordinary activities\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole\n\nLet's analyze the given data step-by-step.\n\n1. **Total Income**: This is represented by \"Total Revenue\" in the income statement. In this case, we find the line item:\n   - Total Revenue: `863371.65`\n\n2. **Inventories Sold**: This is indicated by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. Here, we find the line item:\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: `562950.00`\n\n3. **Costs of General Management and Administration**: This is represented by \"Administrative Expenses\". In the provided data, the line item is:\n   - Administrative Expenses: `16809.11`\n\nNow, compiling these extracted values in the specified order:\n\n- value1 (Total Income): `863371.65`\n- value2 (Inventories Sold): `562950.00`\n- value3 (Administrative Expenses): `16809.11`\n\nFormatting the output as required in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '863371.65', 'value2': '562950.00', 'value3': '16809.11'}}\n```",
