This indicates the amount of tax that is due at the reporting date but does not directly represent the tax expense.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement:**\n   - In the cash flow statement, the line \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" shows 43168.61. This indicates that for the reporting period, there has been an increase in tax payable, which coincides with the amount reflected in the balance sheet.\n\n3. **Income Statement:**\n   - Here, the \"Tax Expense\" is listed as 43168.61 for the reporting period. This is the specific line item that directly states the total amount of tax expense recognized for the period.\n\nConsidering all the above points, the critical value for the amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period can be deduced from the \"Tax Expense\" line in the income statement.\n\nThus, the extracted value for total amount of tax is:\n- **Tax Expense = 43168.61**\n\nWe will format our answer in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '43168.61'} }\n```",
