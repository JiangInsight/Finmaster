In an income statement, this is typically represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) line item.\n\nLet's go through the provided information step by step:\n\n1. Review the line items listed in the income statement.\n2. Identify the relevant line item that represents the costs incurred to sell inventory.\n3. In this case, the line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" has the value of 562950.00.\n\nNow, we can prepare the response in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '562950.00'} }\n```",
