A decrease would imply that the company has collected cash from customers for credit sales which increases cash flow.\n\n2. **Locate the Line Item**: Looking at the cash flow statement provided:\n   - The line item that indicates an increase or decrease in amounts owed is:\n     - **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**: -330748.44.\n\n3. **Determine the Value**: In financial terms, a negative value for accounts receivable indicates a decrease in amount owed:\n   - Here, -330748.44 indicates a collection of debt from customers (decreasing accounts receivable).\n\n4. **Format the Solution**: According to the instruction, we need to provide the value in the specified JSON format.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-330748.44'}}\n```",
