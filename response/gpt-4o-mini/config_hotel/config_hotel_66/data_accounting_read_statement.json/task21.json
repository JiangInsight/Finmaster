First, we locate the key line items that typically reflect operating income:\n   - **Main Business Revenue**: This represents the revenue generated from the core operations of the business. In this case, it is 863371.65.\n   - **Total Revenue**: This generally includes all types of revenue, but since it matches the Main Business Revenue, there's no separate contribution from other sources in this context. It is also 863371.65.\n\n2. Other financial components such as Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Administrative Expenses, Selling Expenses, etc., are related to expenses rather than income. Similarly, Interest Income is not part of core operating activities.\n\n3. The focus is solely on the revenue from the entity's operational activities, which is primarily represented by the \"Main Business Revenue\".\n\nHence, we conclude that the relevant operating income is captured under \"Main Business Revenue\" which is 863371.65.\n\nNow, putting this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '863371.65'} }\n```",
