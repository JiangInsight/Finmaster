The \"Fixed Assets\" or \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" in the Cash Flow Statement is relevant here, but in the provided balance sheet, no current cash payments for fixed asset purchases are indicated.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - The relevant line item for costs incurred to secure orders and deliver goods is \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which is explicitly stated.\n   - There is no cash payment line item here related to property, plant, and equipment.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The relevant line item for cash payments for acquiring property, plant, and equipment is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n\n### Extracting the values:\n- **Cost of Goods Sold** (from **Income Statement**): 562950.00\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets** (from **Cash Flow Statement**): 0.00 (meaning no cash expenditures for this purpose during this period)\n\n### Solution:\nWe will present the solution in the specified JSON format with the values extracted:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '562950.00', 'value2': '0.00'}}\n```",
