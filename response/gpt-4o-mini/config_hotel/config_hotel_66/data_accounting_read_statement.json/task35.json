The four specific line items to extract are:\n\n1. Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver the goods and services (typically represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\").\n2. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds for production and operation (typically represented by \"Financial Expenses\").\n3. The systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life (represented by \"Depreciation\").\n4. The total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period (represented by \"Tax Expense\").\n\nNow, let's locate these line items in the provided income statement:\n\n```markdown\n| Account                  | Amount      | Date       |\n|-------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| Main Business Revenue    | 863371.65   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Total Revenue            | 863371.65   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold       | 562950.00   | 2024-02-01 |  # This is value1\n| Total Cost               | 562950.00   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Gross Profit             | 300421.65   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Administrative Expenses   | 16809.11    | 2024-02-01 |\n| Selling Expenses          | 7553.67     | 2024-02-01 |\n| Depreciation             | 91509.94    | 2024-02-01 |  # This is value2\n| Financial Expenses        | 4319.52     | 2024-02-01 |  # This is value3\n| Total Expenses            | 120192.24   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Interest Income           | 9066.78     | 2024-02-01 |\n| Profit Before Tax        | 189296.19    | 2024-02-01 |\n| Tax Expense               | 43168.61    | 2024-02-01 |  # This is value4\n| Net Profit               | 146127.58   | 2024-02-01 |\n```\n\nThe extracted values are as follows:\n- Costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services (Cost of Goods Sold): **562950.00**\n- Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life (Depreciation): **91509.94**\n- Financing costs incurred (Financial Expenses): **4319.52**\n- Total amount of taxes expected (Tax Expense): **43168.61**\n\nNow I'll present this information in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '562950.00', 'value2': '91509.94', 'value3': '4319.52', 'value4': '43168.61'} }\n```",
