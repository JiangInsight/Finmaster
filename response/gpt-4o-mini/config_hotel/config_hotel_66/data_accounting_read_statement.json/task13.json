They are not intended for sale or consumption.\n\n3. **Total Assets**:\n   - Total Assets: 16,000,000.00 (sum of current and non-current assets)\n\nFrom this analysis, we identify the \"Fixed Assets\" line item relevant to our request, which holds the total initial and end values as follows:\n\n- **Initial Value** of Fixed Assets: 8,000,000.00\n- **End Value** of Fixed Assets: 7,908,490.06 (book value after depreciation)\n\nThus, we can summarize our final answer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7908490.06'}}\n```",
