In this context, the relevant line items typically include:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** - This represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. It specifically includes costs incurred to deliver products or services.\n2. **Selling Expenses** - These are expenses associated with the marketing and selling of products, which also include costs related to securing orders from customers.\n\nNow, let's review the income statement provided:\n\n```\n| Account                     | Amount     | Date       |\n| --------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| Main Business Revenue       | 863371.65  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Total Revenue               | 863371.65  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold          | 562950.00  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Total Cost                  | 562950.00  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Gross Profit                | 300421.65  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Administrative Expenses      | 16809.11   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Selling Expenses            | 7553.67    | 2024-02-01 |\n| Depreciation                | 91509.94   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Financial Expenses           | 4319.52    | 2024-02-01 |\n| Total Expenses               | 120192.24  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Interest Income              | 9066.78    | 2024-02-01 |\n| Profit Before Tax           | 189296.19   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Tax Expense                 | 43168.61   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Net Profit                  | 146127.58  | 2024-02-01 |\n```\n\nFrom the income statement, we have identified the following costs related to securing customer orders and delivering goods:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold:** 562950.00\n- **Selling Expenses:** 7553.67\n\nNext, we sum these costs to determine the total incurred costs for delivering goods and services.\n\n1. Cost of Goods Sold = 562950.00\n2. Selling Expenses = 7553.67\n\nNow, calculating the total costs:\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Costs} = 562950.00 + 7553.67 = 570503.67 \n\\]\n\nSince the instruction asks for the extraction of the specific value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services to customers, we will present the final amount.\n\nFollowing the required format, hereâ€™s the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '570503.67'} }\n```",
