Interest accrued but not yet received, found in the balance sheet as \"Interest Receivable\".\n2. Net addition in cash and cash equivalents during the period, found in the cash flow statement.\n\nWe should follow the defined order of the financial statements while keeping the line item order intact.\n\n### Step-by-Step Extraction:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - From the balance sheet segment, we look for the \"Interest Receivable\" entry:\n     - **Interest Receivable**: End Amount = **9066.78**\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - Next, we find the net increase in the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" during the period:\n     - **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The cash flow statement shows \"Net Increase\" as **-2419019.09**.\n\n### Summary of Values to Extract:\n- **Interest Accrued but Not Yet Received**: 9066.78\n- **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: -2419019.09\n\nThe outputs should be presented in the specified JSON format.\n\n### Final Solution Presentation:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '9066.78', 'value2': '-2419019.09'} }\n```",
