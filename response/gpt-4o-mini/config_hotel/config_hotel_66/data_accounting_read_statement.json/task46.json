                        "content": "To tackle the problem, we need to extract the relevant information from the provided cash flow statement focusing on the section for cash flow from investing activities. We are specifically looking for the net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated (or used) from the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments that are not cash equivalents, along with any interest and dividend receipts.\n\nHere’s how we can reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Sections**: \n   - The cash flow statement consists of three parts:\n      - Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n      - Cash Flow from Investing Activities \n      - Cash Flow from Financing Activities (not present in the current example)\n   - We only focus on ‘Cash Flow from Investing Activities’ based on the task prompt.\n\n2. **Examine Investing Activities**: \n   - Under the Investing Activities, the relevant line item here is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n   - According to the provided cash flow statement, this amount is **0.00**.\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - The net amount from investing activities is given as **-0.00** (which means there was no cash flow generated or used from investing activities).\n\n4. **Net Amount and Sub-Items**:\n   - The only sub-item contributing to the cash flow from investing activities is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\", showing **0.00**.\n\nPutting it all together, the value of cash flow from investing activities is **-0.00**, and the only sub-item related to this is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with a value of **0.00** as well.\n\nNow, we need to format the solution according to the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-0.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '0.00'} }\n```",
