Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Line Item**: In the income statement, we need to look for any line items that are specifically related to financing costs. These could be labeled as \"Financial Expenses,\" \"Interest Expense,\" or similar terms.\n\n2. **Extract the Amount**: Once we locate the relevant line item for financial expenses, we note down the corresponding amount.\n\nIn the provided income statement, we can see the following relevant line:\n\n- Financial Expenses | 4319.52 | 2024-02-01\n\nThis line corresponds directly to the incurred financing costs necessary for operations.\n\nThus, the extracted financing cost value is **4319.52**.\n\nNow, we will present this answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '4319.52'} }\n```",
