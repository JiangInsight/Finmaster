In this case, the line item for \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable\" has a value of 43168.61.\n\nThus, the value of the increase in the amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid is **43168.61**. \n\nNow, we will format our solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '43168.61'} }\n```",
