In accounting terms, this is commonly represented under \"Interest Receivable\".\n\n2. **Extract Required Values**:\n   - For the line item **Interest Receivable**, we need to extract both the initial amount and the end amount.\n   - According to the provided data:\n     - **Initial amount** (as of 2023-12-31): `0.00`\n     - **End amount** (as of 2024-02-01): `9066.78`\n\n3. **Formulate the Answer**: We will structure the final result in the specified JSON format, filling in the required values.\n\nNow, compiling this information into the JSON format stipulated, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '9066.78'} }\n```",
