The primary statements of interest here are the Income Statement and the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n1. **Identifying Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**\n   - The Income Statement provides an item called \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which represents the total cost associated with the inventory that was sold during the reporting period. We find the following entry in the Income Statement:\n     - **Cost of Goods Sold: 562950.00**\n\n2. **Confirming Inventory Changes:**\n   - The Cash Flow Statement provides information about the change in inventory, but for the question regarding inventories sold, we focus on the Income Statement's COGS rather than the total amount of inventory remaining or changes.\n   - The \"Decrease in Inventory\" entry in the Cash Flow Statement reports the change in inventory levels but is not directly relevant to the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the above reasoning, the carrying amount of inventories sold is directly given by the Cost of Goods Sold line item in the Income Statement.\n\nThus, the extracted value is **'562950.00'**.\n\nNow, let's present this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '562950.00'} }\n```",
