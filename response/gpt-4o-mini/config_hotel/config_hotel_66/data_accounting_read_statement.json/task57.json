This line item typically represents the amount of credit purchases or services received that have not yet been paid for.\n\nLet's analyze the balance sheet:\n\n- The only relevant line item in the balance sheet related to the amount owed on credit is **Accounts Payable**.\n- The table shows the following for Accounts Payable:\n  - Initial_amount: 0.00\n  - End_amount: 5472810.00\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that the total amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit at the end of the period is **5472810.00**.\n\nThe specific line that represents this addition in the amount owed during the period is:\n- **Accounts Payable: 5472810.00**\n\nNow, letâ€™s format the answer in the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5472810.00'} }\n```",
