Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit (typically Accounts Receivable).\n2. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation (typically Financial Expenses).\n3. Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets (typically associated with Purchase of Fixed Assets).\n\nWe will examine each financial statement: the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement, in that order. \n\n### Balance Sheet\nFrom the Balance Sheet, we identify:\n- **Accounts Receivable**: This represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit.\n  - End amount: 330748.44\n  \n### Cash Flow Statement\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement, we identify:\n- **Financial Expenses**: This represents the financing costs incurred to raise funds needed for production and operation.\n  - Amount: 4319.52 \n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This reflects cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment.\n  - Amount: 0.00 (as it appears there were no purchases during the period)\n\n### Income Statement\nThere are no relevant figures in this statement that fit the categories we are looking for.\n\nNow we have gathered the relevant line items and their end values:\n- Value for accounts receivable (amounts owed): 330748.44\n- Value for financial expenses: 4319.52\n- Value for purchase of fixed assets: 0.00\n\nWe organize these into the requested format, and the final extraction looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '330748.44', 'value2': '4319.52', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```",
