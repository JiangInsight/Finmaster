                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to extract the line items from the balance sheet that correspond to amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit. These typically include line items such as \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable.\"\n\nLet's break down the relevant entries step by step:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**: This is a liability that represents money owed for goods or services that have been received but not yet paid for.\n   - Initial Amount: 0.00\n   - End Amount: 5472810.00\n\n2. **Taxes Payable**: This represents amounts owed for taxes that the entity must pay. This is also a liability.\n   - Initial Amount: 0.00\n   - End Amount: 43168.61\n\nNow we summarize the amounts owed specifically for goods or services purchased on credit, focusing primarily on Accounts Payable as the main indicator of credit purchases:\n\n- **Total Initial Value** for amounts owed (from the start of the period) is the sum of individual initial amounts:\n  - Accounts Payable Initial: 0.00\n  - Taxes Payable Initial: 0.00\n  - Total Initial = 0.00 + 0.00 = **0.00**\n\n- **Total End Value** for amounts owed (at the end of the period) is the sum of individual end amounts:\n  - Accounts Payable End: 5472810.00\n  - Taxes Payable End: 43168.61\n  - Total End = 5472810.00 + 43168.61 = **5515978.61**\n\nNow we can format this into the required JSON output.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5515978.61'} }\n```",
