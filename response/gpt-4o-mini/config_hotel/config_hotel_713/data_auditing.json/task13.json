The tax amount is also recorded as $20330.70, whereas the original tax expected should be $1233.85.\n\nBased on these observations, I will provide the structured output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Sale', 'Recorded category': 'Sales Expenses', 'Original date': None, 'Recorded date': None, 'Original payment/receipt_status': None, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': None, 'Original payment_method': None, 'Recorded payment_method': None, 'Original quantity': None, 'Recorded quantity': None, 'Original price': None, 'Recorded price': None, 'Original receive_method': None, 'Recorded receive_method': None, 'Original amount': None, 'Recorded amount': None, 'Original tax': '1233.85', 'Recorded tax': '20330.70', 'Original profit': None, 'Recorded profit': None, 'Original Preparer': None, 'Recorded Preparer': None, 'Original Approver': None, 'Recorded Approver': None, 'id': 'Sale20240114022'} }\n``` \n\nThis JSON structure encapsulates the issues identified in the specified transaction while following the predetermined format of conveying errors and inconsistencies.",
