The \"Selling Expenses\" item, which also reflects costs related to selling activities, is specifically noted as **14714.68**.\n\nHowever, the Costs of Goods Sold directly reflects the cost incurred for the production or procurement of the goods sold to customers.\n\nThus, the most relevant line item to present is:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: **353220.00**\n\nIn summary, the main value extracted is **353220.00**, which reflects the costs incurred to deliver the goods and services to customers.\n\nPutting this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '353220.00'} }\n```",
