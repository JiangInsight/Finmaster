However, from the context, we can identify the `Accumulated Depreciation` as an expense type that reflects the depreciation expense incurred over a certain period.\n\nLet's review the relevant entry:\n\n1. **Accumulated Depreciation**\n   - **Initial Amount**: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - **End Amount**: 91488.35 (as of 2024-02-05)\n\nSince `Accumulated Depreciation` indicates the accumulated expense over time related to the wear and tear of fixed assets, we will treat this line item as the specific expense we need to report.\n\nNow, we'll structure this information in the required JSON format, noting the initial and end values for the `Accumulated Depreciation`.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '91488.35'} }\n```",
