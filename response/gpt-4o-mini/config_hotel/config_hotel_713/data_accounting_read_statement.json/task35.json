                        "content": "To extract the required values from the given income statement, we need to identify the specific line items that correspond to the following criteria:\n\n1. Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services (typically represented by Selling Expenses).\n2. Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation (typically represented by Financial Expenses).\n3. Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life (represented by Depreciation).\n4. Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period (represented by Tax Expense).\n\nNow let's refer to the income statement provided in the problem:\n\n```\n| Account                 | Amount     | Date       |\n| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| Main Business Revenue    | 547392.30  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Revenue            | 547392.30  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold       | 353220.00  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Cost               | 353220.00  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Gross Profit             | 194172.30  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Administrative Expenses   | 11762.87   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Selling Expenses          | 14714.68   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation             | 91488.35   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Financial Expenses        | 2220.62    | 2024-02-05 |\n| Total Expenses            | 120186.52  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Interest Income           | 9881.70    | 2024-02-05 |\n| Profit Before Tax        | 83867.48    | 2024-02-05 |\n| Tax Expense              | 27369.63   | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit               | 56497.85   | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\nNow, let's extract the four specific values we need:\n\n1. **Selling Expenses**: 14714.68 (costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services).\n2. **Depreciation**: 91488.35 (systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset).\n3. **Financial Expenses**: 2220.62 (financing costs incurred).\n4. **Tax Expense**: 27369.63 (amount of taxes expected to pay/recover).\n\nNow, we can compile these values into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '14714.68', 'value2': '91488.35', 'value3': '2220.62', 'value4': '27369.63'}}\n```",
