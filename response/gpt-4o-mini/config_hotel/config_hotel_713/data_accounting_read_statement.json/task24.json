The other items such as \"Selling Expenses,\" \"Depreciation,\" or \"Financial Expenses\" do not explicitly relate to the costs of general management and administration as a whole.\n\n4. **Conclude the result**: \n   Since the only specific line item that describes costs related to general management and administration is \"Administrative Expenses,\" we will use its value in our solution.\n\nNow, summarizing that into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '11762.87'} }\n```",
