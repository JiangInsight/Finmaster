The line item \"Main Business Revenue\" represents income from core operating activities. \n2. The value for \"Main Business Revenue\" is **547392.30**.\n3. Additionally, \"Total Revenue\" has the same value, thus confirming the income amount.\n\nSince the task specifically requests to extract the income value from core operating activities, we will select the value from \"Main Business Revenue.\"\n\nNow, we format the final answer into the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '547392.30'}}\n```",
