We will gather that from the income statement.\n\n### 2. **Income Statement**\n- **Financial Expenses**: This line item represents the financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation.\n  - **Value**: `2220.62`\n  \n- Other items in the income statement such as revenue, COGS, etc., do not qualify based on our extraction requirements.\n\n### 3. **Cash Flow Statement**\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This line item indicates cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n  - **Value**: `0.00` (This means there were no cash payments made for purchasing fixed assets during the period.)\n\nNext, we will compile the values in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '200359.99', 'value2': '2220.62', 'value3': '0.00'} }\n```",
