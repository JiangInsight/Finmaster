This is typically “Main Business Revenue”, which indicates the revenue generated from primary business operations.\n   - Next, we need to locate the line item that reflects the cost of inventories sold, which is usually termed “Cost of Goods Sold” (COGS).\n\n2. **Extract the Values**: \n   - Based on the income statement provided:\n     - Main Business Revenue: **547392.30**\n     - Cost of Goods Sold: **353220.00**\n   \n3. **Format the Output**: \n   - We'll format our findings into the requested JSON format.\n\nNow, let's finalize the output according to the instructions:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '547392.30', 'value2': '353220.00'} }\n```",
