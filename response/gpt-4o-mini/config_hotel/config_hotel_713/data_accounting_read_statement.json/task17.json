Amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold or provided on credit (Accounts Receivable).\n2. Amounts owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit (Accounts Payable).\n\nBelow are the steps to extract the necessary information:\n\n1. **Locate the Accounts Receivable Line Item**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, we find \"Accounts Receivable\" in the line items.\n   - The initial value is `0.00` and the end value is `200359.99`.\n\n2. **Locate the Accounts Payable Line Item**:\n   - In the provided balance sheet, we find \"Accounts Payable\" in the line items.\n   - The initial value is `0.00` and the end value is `5015020.00`.\n\nNow that we've successfully identified the values for both line items, we can present them in the required JSON format.\n\nHere is the final structured output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value1': '0.00', 'end valu1': '200359.99', 'initial value2': '0.00', 'end valu2': '5015020.00'}}\n```",
