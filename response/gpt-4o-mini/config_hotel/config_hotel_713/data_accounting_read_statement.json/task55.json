Look for the \"Tax Expense\" line in the income statement. This line specifically indicates the amount of tax that the entity expects to pay for the reporting period.\n\n2. In the provided income statement, we find the \"Tax Expense\" listed as follows:\n   - **Tax Expense**: 27369.63\n\n3. This value represents the total amount of tax that the entity is expected to pay during the reporting period (in this context).\n\n4. There are no other indications in the cash flow or balance sheet data that suggest a different amount for tax payable that would come into consideration for recovery or was missed in expense recognition.\n\n5. Based on this data, the solution to the problem can be stated simply by quoting the extracted value of tax expense.\n\nThus, we format the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '27369.63'} }\n```",
