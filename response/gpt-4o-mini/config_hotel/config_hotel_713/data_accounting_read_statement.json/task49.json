The \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" line item, which represents the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n2. The \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item, which represents the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.\n3. The \"Beginning Balance\" line item under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" which shows the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\nNow let's identify these line items in the provided cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: The value is '5015020.00'.\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The value is '0.00'.\n3. **Beginning Balance**: The value is '8000000.00'.\n\nNow we will format this into the required JSON structure as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5015020.00', 'value2': '0.00', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
