These will typically include items categorized as non-current assets.\n\nFrom the provided balance sheet data, we can identify the following total asset categories:\n\n1. **Total Current Assets**: This generally includes cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and inventory, which are intended for sale or immediate consumption within the operating cycle.\n  \n2. **Total Non-current Assets**: This typically includes fixed assets and any other long-term assets. These are not intended to be sold or consumed in the short term.\n\nThe relevant items needed for this task are:\n\n- **Fixed Assets**: Initially valued at 8,000,000.00 and ending value at 8,000,000.00.\n- **Total Non-current Assets**: Initially valued at 8,000,000.00 and ending value at 7,908,511.65.\n\nNow, we can extract the values for \"Total Non-current Assets\" as they represent assets that are not intended to be realized or sold in the normal course of operations.\n\n- **Initial value of Total Non-current Assets**: 8,000,000.00\n- **End value of Total Non-current Assets**: 7,908,511.65\n\nNext, we can format the final output as required in JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '7908511.65'} }\n```",
