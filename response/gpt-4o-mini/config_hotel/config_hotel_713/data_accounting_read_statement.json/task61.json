Here's the breakdown:\n\n- **From Income Statement**:\n  - Cost of Goods Sold: `353220.00`\n  \n- **From Cash Flow Statement**:\n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets: `0.00`\n\nNow, we construct the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '353220.00', 'value2': '0.00'}}\n``` \n\nThis represents the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods, and the cash payments made for acquiring long-term assets.",
