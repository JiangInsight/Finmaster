It's a major indicator of the expenses related to delivering goods to customers.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses** - These are the expenses associated with the selling of products and services, which can include costs related to securing customer orders.\n\nBased on the provided income statement for February 5, 2024, we have the following amounts for each relevant line item:\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: **353220.00**\n- Selling Expenses: **14714.68**\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services. We simply sum the Cost of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses:\n\nTotal Costs = Cost of Goods Sold + Selling Expenses  \nTotal Costs = 353220.00 + 14714.68 = 368934.68\n\nThe task asks for the specific value of costs, which should be given in the \"solution\" JSON format.\n\nThus, the answer in the specified format would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '368934.68'} }\n```",
