However, it does not provide direct information about the inventories sold.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - The cash flow statement indicates an increase/decrease in inventory amounting to \\(-7,848,830.00\\), which reflects that inventory has decreased by this amount.\n\n3. **Income Statement**:\n   - The income statement provides information about the \"Cost of Goods Sold (COGS),\" which is \\(353,220.00\\). This is the key figure we are interested in since it represents the cost associated with the goods that were sold during this reporting period.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct amount representing the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is the COGS item from the income statement.\n\nThus, we will present the solution as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '353220.00'} }\n```",
