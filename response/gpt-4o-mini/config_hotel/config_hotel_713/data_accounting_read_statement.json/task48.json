Net Profit - The profit retained after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, have been deducted from total revenue.\n2. Purchase of Fixed Assets - The cash payments to acquire property, plant, equipment, and other long-term assets.\n\nNow, letâ€™s locate these values in the provided cash flow statement.\n\n### Provided Cash Flow Statement:\n```markdown\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cash Flow From Operating Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Profit  | 56497.85 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Depreciation  | 91488.35 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -200359.99 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable  | -9881.70 | 2024-02-05 |\n| (Increase) Decrease in Inventory  | -7848830.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable  | 5015020.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable  | 27369.63 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities  | -2868695.86 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities  | -0.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-02-05 |\n| Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Ending Balance  | 5131304.14 | 2024-02-05 |\n| Net Increase  | -2868695.86 | 2024-02-05 |\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Extraction:\n1. **Net Profit**: \n   - Found in the second row under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\": `56497.85`\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**:\n   - Found in the second row under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\": `0.00`\n   - Note that even though it is zero, it still represents the cash payments to acquire assets, and it is relevant to the solution.\n\n### Final Values:\n- `value1`: Net Profit = **56497.85**\n- `value2`: Purchase of Fixed Assets = **0.00**\n\nNow, we will format the solution according to the required JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '56497.85', 'value2': '0.00'} }\n```",
