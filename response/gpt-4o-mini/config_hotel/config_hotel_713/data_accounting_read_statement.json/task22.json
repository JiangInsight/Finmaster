We can use either of these as the revenue for our calculation.\n\n2. **Identify Cost**:\n   - The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" and \"Total Cost\" are both listed as $353220.00. We will use \"Cost of Goods Sold\" for our calculation.\n\n3. **Calculate Gross Profit**:\n   - Gross Profit is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Cost of Goods Sold}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the numbers:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross Profit} = 547392.30 - 353220.00 = 194172.30\n     \\]\n\n4. **Result**:\n   - The value of the difference between revenue and cost, which is also labeled as \"Gross Profit,\" is $194172.30.\n\nPutting it all together, we present the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '194172.30'} }\n```",
