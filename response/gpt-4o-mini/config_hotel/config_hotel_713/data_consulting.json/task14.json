                        "content": "To calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio, we first need to understand the components involved in the calculation. The formula for the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Identify Net Credit Sales\nFrom the income statement, the \"Total Revenue\" represents the net revenue generated during the period, which we can consider as net credit sales since we aren't given specific credit sales data. Here, the \"Total Revenue\" amount is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Revenue} = 547392.30\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Average Accounts Receivable\nTo find the average accounts receivable, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Beginning Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable}}{2}\n\\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n- **Ending Accounts Receivable**: \\(200359.99\\)\n- To find the **Beginning Accounts Receivable**, we know it was \\(0.00\\) (as it shows from the balance sheet).\n\nNow we can calculate the Average Accounts Receivable:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0.00 + 200359.99}{2} = \\frac{200359.99}{2} = 100179.995\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nNow we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{547392.30}{100179.995} \\approx 5.46\n\\]\n\n### Final Calculation\nSince we're asked to present the answer in a json format, rounding to two decimal places, we get:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '5.46'} }\n```",
