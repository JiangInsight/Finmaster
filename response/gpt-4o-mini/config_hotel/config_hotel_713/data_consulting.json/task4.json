                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio, we need to determine the total liabilities and the total owner's equity based on the provided balance sheet data as of the end of the reporting period.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1. **Identify Total Liabilities:**\n   Total liabilities can be found by aggregating current liabilities. The relevant figures from the balance sheet are:\n   - Accounts Payable: 5,015,020.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 27,369.63\n   - Total Current Liabilities (already calculated): 5,042,389.63\n\n   Total Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable + Total Current Liabilities\n   However, since Total Current Liabilities already contains Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable, we can simply take Total Current Liabilities:\n\n   Total Liabilities = 5,042,389.63\n\n2. **Identify Total Owner's Equity:**\n   The total owner's equity is given directly in the balance sheet:\n   - Total Owner's Equity: 16,056,497.85\n\n3. **Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio:**\n   The Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{5,042,389.63}{16,056,497.85}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, we perform the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} \\approx 0.314\n   \\]\n\n4. **Format the Answer:**\n   In terms of financial ratios, it is common to round to two decimal places. Thus, we can round 0.314 to two decimal places for clarity.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the calculations, the Debt to Equity Ratio is approximately 0.31.\n\nHere is the solution represented in the JSON format as requested:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.31'}}\n```",
