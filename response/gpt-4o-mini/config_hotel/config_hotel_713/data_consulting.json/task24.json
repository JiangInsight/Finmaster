                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio and Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio, we will use the information from the three financial statements: balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio\n\n**Debt to Asset Ratio Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Assets = 21098887.48\n- Total Liabilities = Total Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable + Total Current Liabilities  \n  \\( = 5015020.00 + 27369.63 = 5042389.63 \\)\n\nNow substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{5042389.63}{21098887.48} \\approx 0.239\n\\]\n\nSo, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately `0.239`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\n**Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio Formula:**\n\\[ \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}} \\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -2868695.86\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Profit = 56497.85\n\nNow substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-2868695.86}{56497.85} \\approx -50.77\n\\]\n\nHowever, it's important to present this in a positive format for financial ratios, indicating the operating cash flow is significantly less than net income.\n\n### Final Solution Format\nNow we can format the final results together and present them in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.24', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '-50.77'}}\n```\n\n**Note:** It is common practice for financial ratios to be presented in a more conventional format, so the dashed sign in front of the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio indicates a negative cash flow in operations relative to net income, which is a concern for the financial health of the company. Thus, this ratio may not typically present a 'positive' value.",
