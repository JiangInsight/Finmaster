                        "content": "To analyze the financial ratios based on the provided financial statements, we will calculate the following ratios: \n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio** \n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**\n3. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**\n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n5. **Quick Ratio**\n6. **Current Ratio**\n\n### Step-by-step Calculations:\n\n#### 1. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by cash generated from operations.\n- **Formula**: Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: **-2,868,695.86**\n- Total Current Liabilities: **5,042,389.63**\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-2868695.86}{5042389.63} \\approx -0.57\n\\]\n\n#### 2. Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nThis ratio measures the ability of cash flow from operations to cover total debt.\n- **Formula**: Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total Liabilities\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Long-term Liabilities (in this case only Currents given, assuming no long-term).\n    - Total Liabilities = **5,042,389.63** (as no long-term liabilities are indicated)\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-2868695.86}{5042389.63} \\approx -0.57\n\\]\n\n#### 3. Inventory Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures how efficiently a company manages its inventory.\n- **Formula**: Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Cost of Goods Sold: **353,220.00**\n- Average Inventory = Ending Inventory (since there's no beginning inventory value provided, we will take the ending as average) = **7,848,830.00**\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{353220.00}{7848830.00} \\approx 0.045\n\\]\n\n#### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio measures the proportion of debt relative to shareholders' equity.\n- **Formula**: Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Total Liabilities = **5,042,389.63**\n- Total Owner's Equity = **16,056,497.85**\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{5042389.63}{16056497.85} \\approx 0.31\n\\]\n\n#### 5. Quick Ratio\nThis ratio assesses a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n- **Formula**: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nFrom the statements:\n- Current Assets = Total Current Assets: **13,190,375.83**\n- Inventory = **7,848,830.00**\n- Current Liabilities = **5,042,389.63**\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{13190375.83 - 7848830.00}{5042389.63} \\approx 1.83\n\\]\n\n#### 6. Current Ratio\nThis ratio measures a company's ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.\n- **Formula**: Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{13190375.83}{5042389.63} \\approx 2.61\n\\]\n\n### Summary of Results\n- Operating Cash Flow Ratio: -0.57\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio: -0.57\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 0.045\n- Debt to Equity Ratio: 0.31\n- Quick Ratio: 1.83\n- Current Ratio: 2.61\n\nFinally, we need to format these calculations in the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-0.57', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-0.57', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '0.045', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.31', 'Quick Ratio': '1.83', 'Current Ratio': '2.61'} }\n```",
