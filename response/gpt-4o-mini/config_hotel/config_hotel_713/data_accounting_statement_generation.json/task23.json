                        "content": "To calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) from the provided transaction records, we will focus on the purchase transactions, as COGS is typically calculated from the costs associated with inventory sold during the period.\n\n### Step 1: Identify relevant transactions\n\nWe will filter out the purchase records from the transactions given since they typically represent the cost associated with acquiring inventory. We are particularly interested in the amount that corresponds to each purchase transaction.\n\n### Step 2: Summarize Purchase Costs\n\nFrom the provided problem:\n\n- **Purchase Data:**\n  1. Purchase for Business Meal Set: $72,100.00\n  2. Purchase for Business Meal Set: $54,950.00\n  3. Purchase for Deluxe Meal Set: $171,600.00\n  4. Purchase for Business Meal Set: $67,900.00\n  5. Purchase for Luxury Suite: $545,000.00\n  6. Purchase for Luxury Suite: $1,380,000.00\n  7. Purchase for Business Room: $206,000.00\n  8. Purchase for Luxury Suite: $428,000.00\n  9. Purchase for Business Room: $303,000.00\n  10. Purchase for Quick Meal Set: $30,300.00\n  11. Purchase for Luxury Suite: $121,440.00\n  12. Purchase for Standard Room: $1,108,560.00\n  13. Purchase for Banquet Set: $334,080.00\n  14. Purchase for Banquet Set: $616,320.00\n\n### Step 3: Summing Up the Costs\n\nWe can sum these amounts to find the total COGS:\n\n\\[\n\\text{COGS} = 72100 + 54950 + 171600 + 67900 + 545000 + 1380000 + 206000 + 428000 + 303000 + 30000 + 121440 + 1108560 + 334080 + 616320\n\\]\n\nCalculating the total:\n\n1. **72100 + 54950 = 127050**\n2. **127050 + 171600 = 298650**\n3. **298650 + 67900 = 366550**\n4. **366550 + 545000 = 911550**\n5. **911550 + 1380000 = 2291550**\n6. **2291550 + 206000 = 2497550**\n7. **2497550 + 428000 = 2925550**\n8. **2925550 + 303000 = 3228550**\n9. **3228550 + 30000 = 3258550**\n10. **3258550 + 121440 = 3389990**\n11. **3389990 + 1108560 = 4498550**\n12. **4498550 + 334080 = 4832630**\n13. **4832630 + 616320 = 5458950**\n\n### Result Summary\n\nThe final total Cost of Goods Sold is **$5,458,950.00**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHere is the formatted output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '5458950.00'}}\n```",
