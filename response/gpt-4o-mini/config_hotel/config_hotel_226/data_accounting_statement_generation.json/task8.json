This indicates that for this period, the business recorded an expense related to depreciation of this specific amount.\n   - This is the only depreciation entry found in the transaction list, meaning this amount will be the total accumulated depreciation at the end of the reporting period.\n\n3. **Final Value of Accumulated Depreciation:** \n   - Since there is only one depreciation entry recorded, the **Final Value** of accumulated depreciation will simply be the same as that entry, which is `45745.80`.\n\nNow let's compile this information into the required JSON format. \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45745.80'} }\n```",
