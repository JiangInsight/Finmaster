Therefore, for simplicity, if a tax rate applies generally and uniformly across purchases in practice, we could assume it matches the sales.\n\n3. **Finalizing the Calculated Tax Expense:** \n   Since purchases seem substantial but lack detailed tax implications noted, for practical scenarios, if we simply assume tax charged aligns similarly across these purchases, we can note:\n\nFinal Tax Expense = Total Tax from Sales (Assumed Tax Impact from Purchases negligible) = Total Tax from Sales, approximately still listed until the transactions are fully assessed for an accurate business tax position.\n\nThus rounding and confirming, our tax expense would be:\n\n### Answer in requested format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Tax Expense': '11654.68'}}\n``` \n\nHere, the complete detailed step-through helped outline what determined the total tax implications for noted sales and where unresolved, indicated possibilities around adjustments with any payable purchases, treating tax implications.",
