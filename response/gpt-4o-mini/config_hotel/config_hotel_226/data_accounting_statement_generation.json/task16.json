There are only expenses and sales, which don't affect the overall paid-in capital amount directly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the Final Paid-in Capital remains **16,000,000.0** as well.\n\nThe final answer in the required JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '16000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '16000000.00'} }\n```",
