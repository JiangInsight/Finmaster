We will also sum up the `tax_amount` from purchase transactions where applicable.\n\n4. **Compute Net Tax Payable**: \n   - The net tax payable can be derived from the total tax from sales minus the total tax from purchases.\n\nLet's go through the dataset and extract the necessary information.\n\n### Summary of Identified Transactions:\n#### Sales Entries (Sales Tax):\n- Sale20240102002: `tax_amount = 41.97`\n- Sale20240102003: `tax_amount = 23.0`\n- Sale20240103004: `tax_amount = 12.12`\n- Sale20240104005: `tax_amount = 659.92`\n- Sale20240104006: `tax_amount = 132.92`\n- Sale20240104007: `tax_amount = 1121.09`\n- Sale20240104008: `tax_amount = 53.55`\n- Sale20240105010: `tax_amount = 278.18`\n- Sale20240105011: `tax_amount = 228.58`\n- Sale20240105012: `tax_amount = 10.57`\n- Sale20240106016: `tax_amount = 245.9`\n- Sale20240106017: `tax_amount = 85.86`\n- Sale20240106018: `tax_amount = 115.09`\n- Sale20240107019: `tax_amount = 98.0`\n- Sale20240107020: `tax_amount = 103.46`\n- Sale20240107021: `tax_amount = 309.93`\n- Sale20240107022: `tax_amount = 401.0`\n- Sale20240108025: `tax_amount = 655.19`\n- Sale20240108026: `tax_amount = 673.52`\n- Sale20240108027: `tax_amount = 116.15`\n- Sale20240109028: `tax_amount = 292.35`\n- Sale20240109029: `tax_amount = 513.29`\n- Sale20240112038: `tax_amount = 29.09`\n- Sale20240112039: `tax_amount = 989.3`\n- Sale20240112040: `tax_amount = 480.34`\n- Sale20240113041: `tax_amount = 1047.83`\n- Sale20240113042: `tax_amount = 585.36`\n- Sale20240114043: `tax_amount = 486.13`\n- Sale20240114044: `tax_amount = 28.89`\n- Sale20240115045: `tax_amount = 694.15`\n- Sale20240115046: `tax_amount = 508.08`\n- Sale20240116047: `tax_amount = 475.78`\n- Sale20240116048: `tax_amount = 10.09`\n- Sale20240116049: `tax_amount = 88.74`\n- Sale20240120064: `tax_amount = 409.55`\n- Sale20240121066: `tax_amount = 1655.31`\n- Sale20240121067: `tax_amount = 39.38`\n- Sale20240129089: `tax_amount = 742.89`\n- Sale20240129090: `tax_amount = 201.73`\n- Sale20240129091: `tax_amount = 354.44`\n- Sale20240130092: `tax_amount = 771.55`\n- Sale20240130093: `tax_amount = 391.8`\n- Sale20240130094: `tax_amount = 857.87`\n- Sale20240130095: `tax_amount = 69.21`\n- Sale20240131097: `tax_amount = 964.46`\n- Sale20240131098: `tax_amount = 1754.14`\n\n**Total Sales Tax Collected**: \n\nTo calculate the total sales tax collected, sum all the `tax_amount` values:\n``` \n= 41.97 + 23.0 + 12.12 + 659.92 + 132.92 + 1121.09 + 53.55 + 278.18 + 228.58 + 10.57 + 245.9 + 85.86 + 115.09 + 98.0 + 103.46 + 309.93 + 401.0 + 655.19 + 673.52 + 116.15 + 292.35 + 513.29 + 29.09 + 989.3 + 480.34 + 1047.83 + 585.36 + 486.13 + 28.89 + 694.15 + 508.08 + 475.78 + 10.09 + 1655.31 + 39.38 + 742.89 + 201.73 + 354.44 + 771.55 + 391.8 + 857.87 + 69.21 + 964.46 + 1754.14 \nâ‰ˆ 30762.98\n```\n\n#### Purchase Entries (Tax Amount):\n- Purchase20231231002: `tax_amount = 0` (implied)\n- Purchase20231231003: `tax_amount = 0` (implied)\n- Purchase20231231004: `tax_amount = 0` (implied)\n- Purchase20231231005: `tax_amount = 0` (implied)\n- Purchase20231231006: `tax_amount = 0` (implied)\n- Purchase20231231010: `tax_amount = 0` (implied)\n- Purchase20231231011: `tax_amount = 0` (implied)\n- Purchase20231231012: `tax_amount = 0` (implied)\n- Purchase20231231013: `tax_amount = 0` (implied)\n- Purchase20231231014: `tax_amount = 0` (implied)\n- Purchase20231231015: `tax_amount = 0` (implied)\n- etc., until we consider all purchases.\n\nUpon review, no explicit `tax_amount` entries for purchases were identified.\n\n**Total Purchase Tax**: 0\n\n### Final Calculation:\nTo calculate the increase (decrease) in tax payable:\n\\[\n\\text{Increase in Tax Payable} = \\text{Total Sales Tax} - \\text{Total Purchase Tax}\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n\\text{Increase in Tax Payable} = 30762.98 - 0 = 30762.98\n\\]\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable': '30762.98'} }\n```",
