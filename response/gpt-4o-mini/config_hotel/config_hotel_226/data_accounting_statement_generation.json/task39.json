These transactions will have their `type` as \"Interest Receivables\".\n\n2. **Categorize Transactions**:\n   - Determine the amounts recorded in these transactions.\n   - Classify them into \"Unpaid\" and \"Paid\" status.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total**:\n   - Sum all entries under receipts (positive amounts) and unpaid interest (negative amounts).\n\n4. **Perform Adjustments**:\n   - If there are any amounts that have shown negative values (representing a decrease), those will contribute to the overall decrease in receivables.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Finally, we'll represent the result in the required JSON format, indicating whether this represents an increase or a decrease in receivable values.\n\n### Steps to Calculate\n\nLet's extract all `Interest Receivables`:\n\n- **Interest Transactions:**\n  - Interest20240101001: 445.00 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240102002: 445.00 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240103003: 445.00 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240104004: 445.00 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240105005: 445.00 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240106006: 445.00 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240107007: 445.00 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240108008: 445.00 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240109009: 441.93 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240110010: 441.93 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240111011: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240112012: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240113013: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240114014: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240115015: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240116016: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240117017: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240118018: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240119019: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240120020: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240121021: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240122022: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240123023: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240124024: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240125025: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240126026: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240127027: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240128028: 368.02 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240129029: 333.94 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240130030: 333.94 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240131031: 333.94 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240201032: 333.94 (Unpaid)\n  - Interest20240202033: 333.94 (Unpaid)\n\n### Sum Up the Values\n\n**Unpaid Interest Receivables:**\n- Sum = 24 * 445 + 9 * 368.02 + 2 * 441.93 + 2 * 333.94 = 10680.0 + 1892.18 + 883.86 + 667.88 = 10525.02\n \n### Identifying the Increase/Decrease\n\nThe overall transactions signify that for every recording of interest receivables, it is adding up, therefore contributing towards the increase in accounts without any dedicated repayment noticed yet. \n\n### Final Calculation\n\nNow, based on all the records and summations above:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '0'}}\n```   \n\nThis output indicates that, rather than showing a decrease, the interest receivables reflect a net positive addition to receivables, therefore no decrease mentioned.",
