It includes costs related to materials and labor directly used in the creation of the product.\n   - **Selling Expenses**: These are the expenses related to selling the products. This typically includes costs related to sales staff, advertising, marketing, and commissions.\n\n2. **Extracting Relevant Values**:\n   - From the income statement provided, we have:\n     - **Cost of Goods Sold**: 496220.00\n     - **Selling Expenses**: 10967.95\n\n3. **Calculating Total Costs for Customer Orders**:\n   - Total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services would be the sum of COGS and Selling Expenses.\n   - Total Costs = Cost of Goods Sold + Selling Expenses\n   - Total Costs = 496220.00 + 10967.95 = 507187.95\n\nHowever, for the task at hand, we only need to return the value of the Selling Expenses as specified in the instruction. Therefore, we will extract just that.\n\n4. **Presenting the Solution**:\nThe value for the Selling Expenses is 10967.95, which is the specific line item we are interested in.\n\nThus, the final solution will look like this:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '10967.95'} }\n```",
