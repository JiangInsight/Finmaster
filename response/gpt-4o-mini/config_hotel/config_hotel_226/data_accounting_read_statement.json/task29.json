Given that \"Main Business Revenue\" contributes to the total income shown as \"Total Revenue,\" we will select this line item.\n\nThus, we define our sub-item as follows:\n- Sub-item Value: **775598.77** (which is the same as Total Revenue)\n\n**Step 3: Initial and Final Values**\nSince we are required to show both initial and final values for the relevant sub-item, we can note:\n- Initial Value of the sub-item (Main Business Revenue): **775598.77**\n- Final Value of the sub-item (which would also be the same): **775598.77**\n\n**Final Compilation:**\nBy summarizing our findings, we arrive at the structured solution format. \n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '775598.77', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '775598.77'}}\n```",
