This is typically found under the **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** in the Income Statement.\n  \n2. **Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets**. This is usually found in the Cash Flow Statement under the line item for **Purchase of Fixed Assets**.\n\nLetâ€™s extract these values step by step from the given financial statements:\n\n### Step 1: Extracting from the Income Statement\nFrom the **Income Statement**, the line item we're interested in is **Cost of Goods Sold**.\n- **Cost of Goods Sold:** 496220.00\n\n### Step 2: Extracting from the Cash Flow Statement\nFrom the **Cash Flow Statement**, we look for the cash payment made for long-term assets, which is typically under **Purchase of Fixed Assets**.\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets:** 1213417.20\n\n### Final Step: Formatting the Answer\nNow, we can format the extracted values according to the required JSON output format.\n\nThe resulting values we will report are:\n- value1: Cost of Goods Sold = 496220.00\n- value2: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 1213417.20\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '496220.00', 'value2': '1213417.20'} }\n```",
