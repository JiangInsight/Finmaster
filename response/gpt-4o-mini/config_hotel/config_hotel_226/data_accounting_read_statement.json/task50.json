                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to extract four specific line items from the provided cash flow statement:\n\n1. The depreciation amount, which represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n2. The reduction in the amount of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business, which can be inferred from the line items affecting inventory.\n3. The net cash flow from investing activities, which refers to the net amount of cash generated or used from the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets. In this case, it's indicated by \"Purchase of Fixed Assets.\"\n4. The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, which is reflected in the line item \"Net Increase.\"\n\nNow, we will go through the cash flow statement line by line to identify these items:\n\n1. **Depreciation**: The \"Depreciation\" line item has the value **115511.91**.\n   \n2. **Reduction in Assets Held for Sale**: The line item \"Increase (Decrease) in Inventory\" indicates a decrease in inventory (an increase in assets available for sale) of **-8466430.00**. However, this reflects inventory adjustment; it doesn't describe a sale. From the context, this seems to be the only relevant line for \"assets held for sale\".\n\n3. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: The cash flow from investing activities shows \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of **-1213417.20**.\n   \n4. **Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents**: The \"Net Increase\" line item shows the total change in cash and cash equivalents during the period as **-2180564.22**.\n\nNow, we can compile these extracted values into the required JSON format.\n\nHere's the final solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '115511.91', 'value2': '-8466430.00', 'value3': '-1213417.20', 'value4': '-2180564.22'}}\n```",
