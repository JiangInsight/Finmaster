In this case, the relevant line item is:\n\n- **Tax Expense**: 38779.91\n\nThis is clearly identified directly in the income statement provided, and it indicates the total tax expense for the reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the extracted value of the tax amount is:\n\n- Value of Tax Expense: 38779.91\n\nWe will now format this into the required JSON output.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '38779.91'} }\n```",
