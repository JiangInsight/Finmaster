I'll go through the information step by step.\n\n1. We are provided with a cash flow statement which includes various accounts and their respective amounts for a particular date (\"2024-02-02\").\n\n2. We will look for the section related to \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" and identify the specific line that represents the \"Ending Balance\".\n\n3. Within the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section, the following amounts are noted:\n   - Beginning Balance: 8000000.00\n   - Ending Balance: 5819435.78\n   - Net Increase: -2180564.22\n\n4. The \"Ending Balance\" is the value we need to extract, which is: 5819435.78.\n\n5. I will now format this value into the specified JSON format.\n\nThus, the final answer will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5819435.78'} }\n```",
