Total income arising in the course of an entityâ€™s ordinary activities.\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which corresponds to the cost of goods sold.\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole, represented by administrative expenses.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant line items from the income statement provided:\n\n1. **Total Income arising in the course of an entity's ordinary activities**:\n   - This is represented by the \"Total Revenue\" line item, which equals `775598.77`.\n\n2. **Carrying Amount of Inventories Sold**:\n   - This is represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item, which equals `496220.00`.\n\n3. **Costs of General Management and Administration**:\n   - This is represented by the \"Administrative Expenses\" line item, which equals `14043.00`.\n\nNow, putting these values in the required JSON format, we present the results as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '775598.77', 'value2': '496220.00', 'value3': '14043.00'} }\n```",
