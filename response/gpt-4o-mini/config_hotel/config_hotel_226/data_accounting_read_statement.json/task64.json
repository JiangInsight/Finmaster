Let's identify and extract the required items step-by-step.\n\n### **Step 1: Extract line items from the Balance Sheet**\nWe need to find:\n1. Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (Paid-in Capital)\n2. The addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit (Accounts Payable)\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- **Paid-in Capital**: 16000000.00\n- **Accounts Payable**: 7566370.00\n\n### **Step 2: Extract line items from the Income Statement**\nWe need to find:\n1. Profit Before Tax\n\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- **Profit Before Tax**: 151155.01\n\n### **Step 3: Extract line items from the Cash Flow Statement**\nWe need to find:\n1. The net profit for the period\n\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- **Net Profit**: 112375.10\n\n### **Final Grouping**\nNow we will group the identified values by financial statement in the required order:\n1. **Balance Sheet**:\n   - Paid-in Capital: 16000000.00\n   - Accounts Payable: 7566370.00\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - Profit Before Tax: 151155.01\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - Net Profit: 112375.10\n\nHowever, based on the requirement of the task, we only need to return three specific values:\n- Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares (from Balance Sheet)\n- Profit before tax (from Income Statement)\n- Increase in Accounts Payable (addition in the amount owed for goods/services on credit from the Balance Sheet)\n\n### **Required Values**\n- Value 1: Paid-in Capital (Capital contributed by shareholders) = `16000000.00`\n- Value 2: Profit Before Tax = `151155.01`\n- Value 3: Increase in Accounts Payable = `7566370.00`\n\n### **Final JSON Output**\nNow, we will format this into the specified JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '16000000.00', 'value2': '151155.01', 'value3': '7566370.00'}}\n```",
