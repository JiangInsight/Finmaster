We're specifically looking for the line item that indicates the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which is typically represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) in an income statement.\n\nHere are the steps to identify the required information:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Line Items**: We look for terms that typically correspond to inventories or their costs. The \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) is the primary line item that reflects the cost associated with the goods that were sold during the reporting period.\n\n2. **Review the Income Statement**: Upon reviewing the income statement provided:\n   - The line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" has a value of **496220.00**.\n\n3. **Extract the Value**: We should take this identified value to represent the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nUsing these steps, we can construct the solution as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '496220.00'} }\n```",
