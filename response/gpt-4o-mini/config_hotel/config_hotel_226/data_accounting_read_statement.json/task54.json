This is critical since it directly relates to the costs incurred to deliver goods to customers.\n     - Additionally, we can consider Selling Expenses, which encompass costs that are directly tied to selling activities.\n   \n2. **Extract Values**:\n   - From the income statement, we see:\n     - Cost of Goods Sold: **496220.00**\n     - Selling Expenses: **10967.95**\n\n3. **Calculate Total Costs for Delivering Goods and Services**:\n   - We need to sum the Cost of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses to get the total costs pertaining to securing orders and delivering goods:\n     - Total Costs = COGS + Selling Expenses\n     - Total Costs = **496220.00 + 10967.95 = 507187.95**\n\n4. **Final Output**:\n   - The task specifically requests the cost associated with securing customer orders and delivering goods and services, and for this particular problem, we will provide the value for the COGS, which directly corresponds to the delivery of goods: **496220.00**.\n\nThus, the final output in the required format is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '496220.00'} }\n```",
