This is directly linked to the tax liability mentioned in the balance sheet.\n\n3. **Income Statement:**\n   - The \"Tax Expense\" line displays an amount of **38,779.91**. This reflects the tax entity is reporting as an expense for that period.\n\nFrom all three statements, the relevant tax-related figure consistently appears as **38,779.91**.\n\nThus, we summarize that the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period is **38,779.91**.\n\nHereâ€™s the solution formatted in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '38779.91'}}\n```",
