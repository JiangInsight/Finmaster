                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to extract three specific financial line items from the provided financial statements. The items to extract are:\n\n1. End value of net amount of cash and cash equivalents from operating activities (not investing or financing activities).\n2. Amount of taxes accrued but not yet paid.\n3. Total income arising in the course of the entityâ€™s ordinary activities.\n\nWe'll group the extracted values by financial statement in the specified order: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Values from the Financial Statements\n\n1. **Balance Sheet**\n   - We need the total current liabilities related to taxes (Taxes Payable).\n     - **Taxes Payable**: 38779.91\n\n2. **Income Statement**\n   - We need the total revenue generated from the main business activities.\n     - **Total Revenue**: 775598.77\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**\n   - We need the net cash flow from operating activities, specifically the end balance of cash and cash equivalents that is derived from operating activities.\n     - **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -967147.02 (this line indicates cash flow from operations, but we need the ending balance for cash and cash equivalents)\n     - Ending cash balance from Cash and Cash Equivalents: 5819435.78\n\n### Step 2: Extract the Required Values\n\n- **From Cash Flow Statement**, the value we use is the Ending Balance of Cash and Cash Equivalents which is indicative of cash generated or used from operations (as it includes the cumulative effect of various activities).\n    - **Ending Cash and Cash Equivalents**: 5819435.78 \n\nThe final structure of the extracted values is:\n\n- Taxes accrued but not yet paid: **38779.91**\n- Total income from ordinary activities: **775598.77**\n- Ending cash and cash equivalents from operating activities: **5819435.78** \n\n### Final Solution\n\nNow we can present the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '38779.91', 'value2': '775598.77', 'value3': '5819435.78'}}\n```",
