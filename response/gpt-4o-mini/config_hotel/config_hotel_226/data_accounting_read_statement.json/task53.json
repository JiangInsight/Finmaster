This line reports the expenses related to the inventories that were sold during the reporting period.\n   \n2. **Value Extraction**:\n   - From the provided income statement, we can see the line item for \"Cost of Goods Sold\" which is stated as:\n     - **Cost of Goods Sold = 496220.00** (as per the income statement).\n\nThe inventories sold during the reporting period correspond to the cost recorded in the Cost of Goods Sold.\n\nTherefore, the value of the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is **496220.00**.\n\nHereâ€™s the solution formatted as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '496220.00'} }\n```",
