In our case, this section includes:\n        - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 1213417.20 \n\n2. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: \n    - The net cash flow from investing activities is calculated as:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities} = -1213417.20\n      \\]\n   which indicates cash outflow (since it is negative).\n\n3. **Decomposing into sub-items**:\n    - We only have one line item under \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", which is the purchase of fixed assets. Thus, our only sub-item is:\n      - Purchase of Fixed Assets: 1213417.20 \n\n4. **Final Values**:\n   - The cash flow related to investing activities yields a net value of -1213417.20, and the decomposed sub-item (the purchase of fixed assets) is valued at 1213417.20.\n\nNow, we can present the results in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1213417.20', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '1213417.20'}}\n```",
