                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio, we need to determine the total liabilities and total equity as of the end of the reporting period. \n\n### Step 1: Identify Total Liabilities \nFrom the balance sheet, we need to sum up the liabilities. The relevant accounts are:\n- Accounts Payable: 7,566,370.00\n- Taxes Payable: 38,779.91\n- Total Current Liabilities: 7,605,149.91 \n\nIn this case, we can consider Total Current Liabilities directly as they encompass all short-term liabilities. Assuming there are no other liabilities, the total liabilities will be equal to Total Current Liabilities.\n\nThus:\n**Total Liabilities = 7,605,149.91**\n\n### Step 2: Identify Total Equity \nFrom the balance sheet, we need to sum up the equity accounts. The relevant accounts are:\n- Paid-in Capital: 16,000,000.00\n- Retained Earnings: 112,375.10\n\nCalculating Total Owner's Equity:\n**Total Owner's Equity = Paid-in Capital + Retained Earnings**\n**Total Owner's Equity = 16,000,000.00 + 112,375.10 = 16,112,375.10**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Debt to Equity Ratio\nThe Debt to Equity Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Equity}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we obtained:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{7,605,149.91}{16,112,375.10} \\]\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\\[ \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} \\approx 0.472 \\]\n\n### Final Output\nWe present the result in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.47'}}\n```",
