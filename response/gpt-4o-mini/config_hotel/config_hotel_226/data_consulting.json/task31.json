                        "content": "To calculate the requested financial ratios, we will use the information provided in the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\n\nThe Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio measures how often a company collects its average accounts receivable. \n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\n- **Net Revenue** for the period is provided in the income statement:\n  - Total Revenue = 775598.77\n\n- **Average Accounts Receivable** can be calculated as:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Accounts Receivable (Beginning)} + \\text{Accounts Receivable (Ending)}}{2}\n  \\]\n  Since the beginning Accounts Receivable is 0, we can use:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{0 + 321015.98}{2} = 160507.99\n  \\]\n\nNow we can calculate the turnover ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{775598.77}{160507.99} \\approx 4.84\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio assesses how well current liabilities are covered by the cash generated from operations.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** is given as -967147.02.\n- **Total Current Liabilities** is provided in the balance sheet:\n  - Total Current Liabilities = 7605149.91\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-967147.02}{7605149.91} \\approx -0.127\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio}\n\\]\n\nSince this is identical to the Operating Cash Flow Ratio derived above:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} \\approx -0.127\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Asset Turnover Ratio\n\nThis ratio indicates how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\n- **Average Total Assets** can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Total Assets} = \\frac{\\text{Total Assets (Beginning)} + \\text{Total Assets (Ending)}}{2} = \\frac{16000000 + 23717525.01}{2} = 19858762.51\n\\]\n\nNow we can compute:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{775598.77}{19858762.51} \\approx 0.039\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Debt to Equity Ratio\n\nThis ratio evaluates a company's financial leverage and is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Equity}}\n\\]\n\n- **Total Liabilities** = Total Current Liabilities = 7605149.91 (assuming no non-current liabilities).\n- **Total Equity** = 16112375.10.\n\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{7605149.91}{16112375.10} \\approx 0.471\n\\]\n\n### Final Step: Present the Results\n\nNow, we compile our calculated ratios into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    \"Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\": \"4.84\",\n    \"operating cash flow ratio\": \"-0.127\",\n    \"operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio\": \"-0.127\",\n    \"Total Asset Turnover Ratio\": \"0.039\",\n    \"Debt to Equity Ratio\": \"0.471\"\n}}\n```",
