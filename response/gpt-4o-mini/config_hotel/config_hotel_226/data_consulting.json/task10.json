This amount was calculated and is shown as:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: **-967147.02**.\n\n2. **Extract Current Liabilities**: We find the total current liabilities from the balance sheet. It is listed as:\n   - Total Current Liabilities: **7605149.91**.\n\n3. **Calculate the Ratio**:\n   - The ratio is calculated with the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{-967147.02}{7605149.91} \\approx -0.127\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert Ratio to a More Understandable Format**: \n   - This can be expressed as \"-0.13\" (when rounded to two decimal points).\n\n5. **Prepare the Final Answer**: Now we will present our answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-0.13'} }\n```",
