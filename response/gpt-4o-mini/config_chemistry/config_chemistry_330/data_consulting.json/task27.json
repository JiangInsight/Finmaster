                        "content": "To solve the problem, we will calculate three financial ratios: the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio, and the Quick Ratio using the provided financial statements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculations:\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**:\n   - **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** is given as -5,394,333.52.\n   - **Net Income** is given as -1,175,062.19.\n   \n   The ratio is calculated as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}}\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-5394333.52}{-1175062.19} \\approx 4.59\n   \\]\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**:\n   - **Total Revenue** is given as 7,099,920.95.\n   - **Average Current Assets**: The current assets at the end are given as 7,660,411.14. Since we are taking average, we use the initial current assets value (8,000,000).\n   \n   The average is calculated as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{8000000 + 7660411.14}{2} = 7830205.57\n   \\]\n\n   The ratio is calculated as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}} = \\frac{7099920.95}{7830205.57} \\approx 0.91\n   \\]\n\n3. **Quick Ratio**:\n   - **Current Assets** at the end = 7,660,411.14.\n   - **Current Liabilities** at the end = 3,054,996.05.\n   \n   We need to find Quick Assets, which is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory} - \\text{Other Current Assets}\n   \\]\n\n   Here, we have:\n   - Cash on Hand = 145666.48\n   - Bank Deposits = 194711.58\n   - Interest Receivable = 1731.44\n   - Accounts Receivable = 3,558,301.64\n   - Inventory = 3,760,000.00 is not included in Quick Assets.\n\n   Summing Quick Assets:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Assets} = 145666.48 + 194711.58 + 1731.44 + 3558301.64 = 3779411.14\n   \\]\n\n   The Quick Ratio is then calculated as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} = \\frac{3779411.14}{3054996.05} \\approx 1.24\n   \\]\n\n### Final Values:\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio: Approximately **4.59**\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio: Approximately **0.91**\n- Quick Ratio: Approximately **1.24**\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '4.59', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.91', 'Quick Ratio': '1.24'}}\n```",
