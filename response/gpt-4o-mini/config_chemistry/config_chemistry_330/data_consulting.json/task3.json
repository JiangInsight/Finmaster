                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio, we need to find the total liabilities and total assets as per the balance sheet provided. The Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nNow let's extract the relevant numbers from the provided balance sheet and perform the calculations step-by-step.\n\n1. **Total Assets**: We find this in the balance sheet:\n   - Total Assets = 14,879,933.86\n\n2. **Total Liabilities**: We will sum up the current liabilities:\n   - Accounts Payable = 2,700,000.00\n   - Taxes Payable = 354,996.05\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 3,054,996.05\n\nSince the problem provides only current liabilities without mentioning any long-term liabilities, we assume total liabilities are equal to total current liabilities in this case.\n\n3. **Calculating Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{3,054,996.05}{14,879,933.86}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, let's compute this ratio:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} \\approx 0.2044\n   \\]\n\n   We convert this to a more user-friendly format (by rounding it to two decimal places if necessary).\n\n4. **Final Result Formatting**: Find the required format for the final output.\n\nBased on the calculations above, the Debt to Asset Ratio computes approximately to 0.2044. Therefore, we present the answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.20'}}\n```",
