Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n2. Total Liabilities\n\n**1. Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities:**\nFrom the cash flow statement provided:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5394333.52\n\n**2. Total Liabilities:**\nFrom the balance sheet, Total Liabilities are calculated by:\n- Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable\n- Total Current Liabilities = 3054996.05 (as provided)\n- Assuming there are no long-term liabilities mentioned, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 3054996.05\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-5394333.52}{3054996.05} \\approx -1.76\n\\]\n\n### Final Values\n\nBased on our calculations:\n- Gross Profit Margin ≈ 21.95%\n- Cash Flow to Debt Ratio ≈ -1.76 (we will round it to -1.76 for presentation)\n\n### Preparation of Final Answer\n\nNow, we will format it as required:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Gross Profit Margin': '21.95%', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.76'}}\n```",
