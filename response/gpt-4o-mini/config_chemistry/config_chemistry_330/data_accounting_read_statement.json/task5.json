The line items included are:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits\n   - Interest Receivable\n   - Accounts Receivable\n   - Inventory\n   - Total Current Assets\n   - Fixed Assets\n   - Accumulated Depreciation\n   - Total Non-current Assets\n   - Total Assets\n   - Accounts Payable\n   - Taxes Payable\n   - Total Current Liabilities\n   - Paid-in Capital\n   - Retained Earnings\n   - Total Owner's Equity\n   - Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity\n\n2. Among these, **Inventory** is the relevant account representing assets that are held for sale or are in production for sale.\n\n3. We specifically note:\n   - Initial amount for Inventory: **0.00**\n   - End amount for Inventory: **3760000.00**\n\n4. Therefore, the solution based on the understanding of the asset held for sale (inventory) is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3760000.00'} }\n```",
