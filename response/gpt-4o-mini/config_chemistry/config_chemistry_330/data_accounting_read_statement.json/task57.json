Here it states an increase of 2,700,000.00.\n\n3. **Net Changes**: \n   - We focus on the Accounts Payable increase since it reflects purchases made on credit. The increase of 2,700,000.00 in Accounts Payable indicates goods or services that were purchased on credit.\n\nBased on this analysis, the specific addition to the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit is reflected in the increase in Accounts Payable.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2700000.00'} }\n```",
