It starts at zero and accumulates over time.\n2. **Taxes Payable**: While this is technically a liability, it represents expenses owed to the government that will be realized in the profit or loss statement.\n\nBased on the problem provided:\n\n- **Accumulated Depreciation**: \n  - Initial Amount: **0.00**\n  - End Amount: **45765.70** (this represents the expense that has accumulated over the accounting period)\n\n- **Taxes Payable**: \n  - Initial Amount: **0.00**\n  - End Amount: **354996.05**\n\nHowever, we are particularly asked for the extraction of only one line item related to expenses. In this case, the most relevant item to choose would be **Accumulated Depreciation**, as it directly impacts the profit or loss statement.\n\nThus, the initial and end values for *Accumulated Depreciation* are:\n- Initial value: **0.00**\n- End value: **45765.70**\n\nHere is the final answer presented in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45765.70'} }\n```",
