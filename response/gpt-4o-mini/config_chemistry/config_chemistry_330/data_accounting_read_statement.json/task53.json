It includes the cost of producing or purchasing the goods that were sold to generate revenue.\n\n2. **Relevant Data Extraction**: \n   - From the income statement, we can see the following line item:\n     - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): 5540000.00\n\n3. **Conclusion**: \n   - The value of the inventories sold during this period, represented through COGS, is 5540000.00.\n\nPutting this information into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5540000.00'} }\n```",
