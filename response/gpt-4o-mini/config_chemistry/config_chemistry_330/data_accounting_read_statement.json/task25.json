It directly relates to delivering goods and fulfilling customer orders.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses**: This represents costs incurred to secure customer orders, such as marketing and sales expenses.\n\nFrom the provided data, we note the following amounts for these line items:\n- **Cost of Goods Sold**: 5540000.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: 395393.99\n\nNow, we simply sum these two amounts to get the total costs incurred:\n\nTotal Costs = Cost of Goods Sold + Selling Expenses\n= 5540000.00 + 395393.99\n= 5935393.99\n\nHowever, the task specifically requests to extract the value of the Selling Expenses incurred to secure customer orders.\n\nThus, the relevant value for our solution is from the line item pertaining to Selling Expenses.\n\nHere is the final output, structured according to the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '395393.99'} }\n```",
