The value for this item is **5540000.00**.\n   - The income statement does not directly show cash payments for property, plant, and equipment (PPE), so we will not extract that from the income statement.\n\n3. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The relevant line item for cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment is **Purchase of Fixed Assets**, which amounts to **2265288.42**. \n\nNow, we will collect our results based on the above analysis and format them in JSON as required.\n\n### Results Compilation:\n- From the Income Statement: `value1` = '5540000.00'\n- From the Cash Flow Statement: `value2` = '2265288.42'\n\nPutting this all together in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5540000.00', 'value2': '2265288.42'} }\n```",
