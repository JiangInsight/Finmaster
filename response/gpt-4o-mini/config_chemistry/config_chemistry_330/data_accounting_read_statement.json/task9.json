We need to find the \"Taxes Payable\" account, as it typically represents the taxes that have been accrued but not yet paid.\n\n2. **Locate the Taxes Payable Account**: When reading through the provided data, we can see the following entry:\n   ```\n   | Taxes Payable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 354996.05 | 2024-01-29 |\n   ```\n\n3. **Extract Initial and End Values**: \n   - The **Initial Amount** for \"Taxes Payable\" is 0.00. This means there was no tax liability recognized at the beginning of the period (2023-12-31).\n   - The **End Amount** for \"Taxes Payable\" is 354996.05. This indicates the amount of taxes that are owed at the end of the period (2024-01-29).\n\n4. **Prepare the Output**: We now format these values into the required JSON format.\n\nThe solution will look like this:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '354996.05'}}\n``` \n\nThis JSON response succinctly provides the initial and final values for taxes accrued but not yet paid as identified in the balance sheet.",
