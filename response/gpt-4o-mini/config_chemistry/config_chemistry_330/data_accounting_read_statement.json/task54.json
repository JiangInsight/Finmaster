This is typically the most important line item that corresponds to the costs incurred to deliver goods to customers.\n   - **Selling Expenses**: These are costs related to the selling activities, which can also include costs incurred to secure customer orders. \n\n2. **Extract Values from Income Statement**:\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: The value in the income statement is reported as **5540000.00**.\n   - **Selling Expenses**: The value reported is **395393.99**.\n\n3. **Focus on Costs Incurred to Deliver Goods and Secure Orders**:\n   - We recognize that **Cost of Goods Sold** directly correlates to the cost of delivering goods.\n   - **Selling Expenses** are also relevant as they pertain to costs of securing customer orders.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - To summarize the costs that relate to customer orders and the delivery of goods, we can consider both COGS and Selling Expenses. However, COGS is the primary line item reflecting costs of delivering goods. \n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The most relevant value to represent the costs incurred specifically to deliver goods and services to customers is **5540000.00** from Cost of Goods Sold.\n   - We do not combine the COGS with Selling Expenses for this task, as \"costs incurred to deliver goods and services\" typically refer solely to COGS in financial terminology.\n\nThus, we capture the value from the COGS.\n\n### Final Output in Required Format\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5540000.00'}}\n```",
