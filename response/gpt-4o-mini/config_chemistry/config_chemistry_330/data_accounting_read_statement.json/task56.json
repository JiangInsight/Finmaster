We can find depreciation information in both the cash flow statement and the income statement.\n\n1. **Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - We look for a line item labeled \"Depreciation,\" which shows the amount carried out as a cash flow from operating activities. \n   - In the provided cash flow statement, the depreciation amount is **45765.70**.\n\n2. **Income Statement**:\n   - The income statement will also have a line item labeled \"Depreciation,\" which indicates the expense recognized due to the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n   - Here too, in the income statement, the depreciation amount is also **45765.70**.\n\nFrom our review, both statements use the same amount for depreciation, confirming consistency across the financial statements.\n\nFinally, since we want to report the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, we will extract the identified depreciation value.\n\nNow we can present the solution in JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45765.70'} }\n```",
