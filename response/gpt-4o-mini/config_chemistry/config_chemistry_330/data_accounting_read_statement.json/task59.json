Identify line items related to 'interest accrued but not yet received'\nThis corresponds to \"Interest Receivable\" from the Balance Sheet and \"Interest Income\" from the Income Statement.\n\n### 2. Identify the line item related to 'net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period'\nThis corresponds to \"Net Increase\" in the Cash Flow Statement.\n\n### Extract Values\nNow, we will gather the relevant values from the financial statements provided.\n\n#### Balance Sheet\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n- **Interest Receivable**: 1731.44\n\n#### Income Statement\nFrom the Income Statement:\n- **Interest Income**: 1731.44 (though it's not directly supposed to be considered for extraction based on the task description, we have noted it down for context)\n\n#### Cash Flow Statement\nFrom the Cash Flow Statement:\n- **Net Increase**: -7659621.94 (this is the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents)\n\n### Final Step\nNow, we summarize the two specific values that we need for the solution:\n1. From the Balance Sheet, we have the value of interest accrued but not yet received as 1731.44.\n2. From the Cash Flow Statement, we have the net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents as -7659621.94.\n\nNow, we will format this into the required JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1731.44', 'value2': '-7659621.94'} }\n```",
