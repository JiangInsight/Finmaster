In cash flow statements, this is typically represented by the line item titled \"(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable.\"\n\nLet's analyze the entries step by step:\n\n1. The relevant section is titled \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n2. We check each line item under this section.\n\nHere are the entries to consider:\n\n- **Net Profit**: -1175062.19\n- **Depreciation**: 45765.70\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**: -3558301.64\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable**: -1731.44\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: -3760000.00\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: 2700000.00\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable**: 354996.05\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -5394333.52\n\nThe line item of interest is:\n\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**: -3558301.64\n\nThis line item indicates that the amounts owed to the entity have decreased by 3,558,301.64. \n\nNow, I will present the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3558301.64'} }\n```",
