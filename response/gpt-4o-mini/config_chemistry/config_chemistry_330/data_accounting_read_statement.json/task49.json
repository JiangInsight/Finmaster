The amount for this entry is **2700000.00**.\n\n2. **Acquisition of property, plant and equipment**: This corresponds to \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\". The amount here is **2265288.42**.\n\n3. **Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period**: This corresponds to \"Beginning Balance\", which is **8000000.00**.\n\nNow let's compile these findings into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2700000.00', 'value2': '2265288.42', 'value3': '8000000.00'}}\n```",
