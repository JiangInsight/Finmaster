We start by identifying the total income from the income statement. The total income is indicated by the line item “Total Revenue.” In the given problem, the total income is:\n   - Total Revenue: 7099920.95\n   \n2. Next, we look for the component sub-items that contribute to the total income. The constituent line items for Total Revenue are typically represented by the sales or revenues made from the main business activities. In this case:\n   - Main Business Revenue: 7099920.95\n\n3. We need to generate the output according to the specified JSON format. The total income value has been noted, and the only relevant sub-item (the component contributing to the total income) is the Main Business Revenue.\n\nPutting these together, we have:\n- Total income value: '7099920.95'\n- Sub-item value: '7099920.95'\n\nNow we format our final answer in the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '7099920.95', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '7099920.95'}}\n```",
