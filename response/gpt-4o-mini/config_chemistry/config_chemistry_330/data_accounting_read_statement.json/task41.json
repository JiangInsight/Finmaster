The cash flow statement lists various accounts under the section \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities.\"\n2. We are specifically interested in any line item that indicates an increase or decrease in tax payable.\n3. From the cash flow statement presented:\n   - There is a line item labeled \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable,\" which has the following details:\n     - **Account**: Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable \n     - **Amount**: 354996.05 \n     - **Date**: 2024-01-29\n\n4. Since we are looking for the value of the increase in tax accrued but not yet paid, we can see that the tax payable has indeed increased by 354996.05.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the value of the increase in tax accrued but not yet paid is 354996.05.\n\nHere is the answer formatted in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '354996.05'} }\n```",
