In the statement, this is shown as \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n   - **Depreciation:** This represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life and is specifically listed in the statement as \"Depreciation\".\n   - **Financial Expenses:** This captures the financing costs incurred by the enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation and is found as \"Financial Expenses\".\n   - **Tax Expense:** This line item indicates the total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period, labeled in the statement as \"Tax Expense\".\n\n2. **Extract the amounts for each identified line item:**\n   - Cost of Goods Sold = **5540000.00**\n   - Depreciation = **45765.70**\n   - Financial Expenses = **410850.65**\n   - Tax Expense = **354996.05**\n\n3. **Compile the extracted values in the required JSON format:**\n   - We ensure to follow the original order of the line items as they appear in the income statement.\n\nNow we can present all these values in the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '395393.99', 'value2': '45765.70', 'value3': '410850.65', 'value4': '354996.05'} }\n```",
