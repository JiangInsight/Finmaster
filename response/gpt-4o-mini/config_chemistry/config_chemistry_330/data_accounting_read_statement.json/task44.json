In this section, the relevant sub-items are:\n   - Beginning Balance\n   - Ending Balance\n   - Net Increase\n\n3. **Extract the Ending Balance**: In the given content, we look for the \"Ending Balance\" line item within the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section to find the value at the end of the period. \n\n4. **Identify the Value**: The value associated with the \"Ending Balance\" entry is:\n   ```\n   Ending Balance  | 340378.06 | 2024-01-29\n   ```\n   Therefore, the ending balance of cash and cash equivalents is `340378.06`.\n\n5. **Prepare the Solution**: Now that we've extracted the needed information, we will format it in the required JSON structure.\n\nNow, we'll compile this into the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '340378.06'} }\n```",
