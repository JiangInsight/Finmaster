Looking through the cash flow statement, I need to locate elements that pertain to liabilities incurred or amounts owed. The relevant line item in this case is \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable.\" This line item represents the changes in amounts owed by the entity for credit purchases.\n\n2. Reviewing the details given:\n   - **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: 2700000.00\n\nThis indicates that the entity has incurred additional liabilities (amounts owed) of 2,700,000.00 during the specified period.\n\n3. No other instances in the statement show relevant additions related to credit purchases besides “Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable,” so we can conclude this is the only figure that applies.\n\nThus, the extracted value corresponding to the addition in the amount owed by the entity is 2,700,000.00.\n\nHence, the solution can be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2700000.00'} }\n```",
