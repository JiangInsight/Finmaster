                        "content": "To calculate the taxes payable for the given transactions, we will focus on the `tax_amount` present in each transaction. \n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial and Final Tax Amounts\nFrom the provided transaction data, evaluate the `tax_amount` field:\n\n- The initial transactions start with `tax_amount` of 0.00 as all transactions up until any sales have no taxes accrued.\n- As we process transactions that usually generate tax (i.e., sales), we will sum these `tax_amount` values to determine the end balance.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Transactions\n1. The `Initial` transactions have **no tax amounts** as they are primarily deposits and fixed asset acquisitions.\n  \n2. From the `Sale` transactions, we will accumulate the `tax_amount` values:\n   - Each sale contains an amount that generates tax payable.\n  \n3. The relevant transactions for tax payable counting include various 'Sale' entries. Specifically, we will tally up the `tax_amount` from each relevant transaction.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of Taxes\nLet's tally the `tax_amount` values from the sales based on the provided transactions:\n\n```    \nSale20240103004: tax_amount = 640.42\nSale20240104005: tax_amount = 5515.25\nSale20240104006: tax_amount = 13084.81\nSale20240105008: tax_amount = 5748.65\nSale20240105009: tax_amount = 1696.18\nSale20240106010: tax_amount = 5525.31\nSale20240106011: tax_amount = 1666.96\nSale20240107013: tax_amount = 2218.12\nSale20240108015: tax_amount = 19125.74\nSale20240118034: tax_amount = 32431.18\nSale20240119036: tax_amount = 2509.99\nSale20240120038: tax_amount = 3403.90\nSale20240122041: tax_amount = 3295.12\nSale20240123043: tax_amount = 13465.34\nSale20240125047: tax_amount = 12186.71\nSale20240126048: tax_amount = 550.66\nSale20240129053: tax_amount = 28918.70\n```\n### Step 4: Total Calculation\nCalculating the total:\n\n```\nTotal Tax Payable = 640.42 + 5515.25 + 13084.81 + 5748.65 + 1696.18 + 5525.31 + \n                   1666.96 + 2218.12 + 19125.74 + 32431.18 + 2509.99 + \n                   3403.90 + 3295.12 + 13465.34 + 12186.71 + 550.66 +\n                   28918.70\n```\n\nCalculating this sum results in:\n\n```\nTaxes Payable End Value = 271550.92\n```\n\nGiven there are no initial taxes payable, the initial value remains:\n\n```\nTaxes Payable Initial Value = 0.00\n```\n\n### Final Summary\nNow we present the result in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Taxes Payable End Value': '271550.92'} }\n```",
