We are interested in both the amounts (increases) and the negative amounts (decreases).\n\n2. **Summarize Interest Transactions**: We will begin by initializing a variable to track the total interest receivables and then iterate through each transaction, adding the amounts where the payment/receipt status is \"Unpaid\". \n\n3. **Calculate Total Changes**: For each record of interest receivables, we'll make sure to check whether the amount is positive (increases our receivables) or negative (decreases our receivables), and we'll adjust our total accordingly.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Finally, we will format the result into the required JSON format.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\nNow let's compile the interest receivable transactions:\n\n- From the list, we can see the following relevant entries:\n\n| id                 | type                   | date       | amount        | payment/receipt_status |\n|---------------------|------------------------|------------|---------------|------------------------|\n| Interest20240101001 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-01 | 396.94        | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240102002 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-02 | 127.9193      | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240103003 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-03 | 127.9193      | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240104004 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-04 | 127.9193      | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240105005 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-05 | 127.9193      | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240106006 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-06 | 127.9193      | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240107007 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-07 | 127.9193      | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240108008 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-08 | 85.6479       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240109009 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-09 | 85.6479       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240110010 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-10 | 85.6479       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240111011 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-11 | 85.6479       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240112012 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-12 | 85.6479       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240113013 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-13 | 39.3679       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240114014 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-14 | -31.8321      | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240115015 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-15 | 12.6679       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240116016 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-16 | 12.6679       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240117017 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-17 | 12.6679       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240118018 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-18 | 12.6679       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240119019 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-19 | 12.6679       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240120020 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-20 | 12.6679       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240121021 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-21 | 12.6679       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240122022 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-22 | -31.6419      | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240123023 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-23 | -7.2798       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240124024 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-24 | 10.5202       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240125025 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-25 | 10.5202       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240126026 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-26 | 8.4293        | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240127027 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-27 | 17.3293       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240128028 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-28 | 17.3293       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240129029 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-29 | 17.3293       | Unpaid                 |\n| Interest20240130030 | Interest Receivables    | 2024-01-30 | 14.6535       | Unpaid                 |\n\n### Summation:\nWe do the following tally:\n- **Positive total**:\n  396.94 + 127.9193 + 127.9193 + 127.9193 + 127.9193 + 127.9193 + 127.9193 + 85.6479 + \n  85.6479 + 85.6479 + 85.6479 + 39.3679 + 12.6679 + 12.6679 + 12.6679 + \n  12.6679 + 12.6679 + 12.6679+ 10.5202 + 10.5202 + 8.4293 + 17.3293 + \n  17.3293 + 17.3293 + 14.6535 = **$1478.0887**\n\n- **Negative total**:\n  -31.8321 - 7.2798 = **$-39.1119**\n\n### Final Calculation:\nTotal Interest Receivable = Positive Total - Negative Total \n= 1478.0887 - 39.1119 \n= **1438.9768**\n\n### Format the Output:\nWe will format this total as required in the output.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'(Increase) Decrease in Interest Receivable': '1438.98'} }\n```",
