Liabilities typically include unpaid purchases, accounts payable, loans, and other funds owed.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Transactions\n\nLooking through the provided transactions, we can classify them as follows:\n\n1. **Initial Liabilities**: These consist of the initial recorded transactions which do not create liabilities, as they are initial deposits. Therefore, the initial liabilities amount is `0.00`.\n\n2. **Purchases and Expenses**:\n   - **Unpaid Purchases**:\n     - We have unpaid purchases and expenses that will contribute to total liabilities.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Unpaid Purchases\n\nFrom the data provided:\n\n- **Purchase Transactions with Unpaid Status**:\n  - `Purchase20231231001`: Not paid, amount = 540,000.00\n  - `Purchase20231231008`: Not paid, amount = 270,000.00\n  - Additionally, other purchase transactions (like \"depreciation\" or \"assets\") do not count towards liabilities.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Liabilities\n\n1. **Initial Liabilities** = 0.00\n\n2. **Total Unpaid Purchases**:\n   - Total Unpaid Purchases = `540,000.00 + 270,000.00 = 810,000.00`\n   \n3. **Final Liabilities** = Initial Liabilities + Total Unpaid Purchases = `0.00 + 810,000.00 = 810,000.00`\n\nThus, we have the following values:\n\n- **Total Liabilities Initial Value**: `0.00`\n- **Total Liabilities End Value**: `810000.00`\n\nHere is the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '810000.00'} }\n```",
