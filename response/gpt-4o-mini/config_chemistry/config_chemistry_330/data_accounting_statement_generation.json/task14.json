Based on the table column names, the entries that will contribute towards current liabilities are:\n- **Purchases where payment status is “Unpaid”**: These contribute to accounts payable, which is an element of current liabilities.\n- Any other entries that indicate short-term obligations or financial liabilities that aren't yet paid (e.g., unpaid interest receivables).\n\n### Step 2: Sum Up Unpaid Liabilities\n\n1. **Initial Current Liabilities**:\n   - The initial value starts from zero, as indicated at the beginning of the transactions: \n     - Total Current Liabilities Initial Value = **0.00**.\n\n2. **End Current Liabilities**:\n   - Now, we tally up unpaid liabilities from the purchases recorded as \"Unpaid\".\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Transaction\n\nFrom the provided data, I'll focus on rows with the relevant entries for purchases:\n\n- **Unpaid Liabilities (for accuracy)**:\n    - `Purchase20231231005`: Amount = **2,700,000.00** (Unpaid)\n    - `Purchase20231231001`: Amount = **540,000.00** (Unpaid)\n    - `Purchase20231231002`: Amount = **2,500,000.00** (Unpaid)\n    - **Sum Up**: \\( 2,700,000 + 540,000 + 2,500,000 = 5,740,000.00 \\)\n\n3. **Confirm final current liabilities value**:\n   - Total Current Liabilities End Value = **5,740,000.00**.\n\n### Step 4: Present the Solution\n\nNow, compile the findings into the expected JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '5740000.00'} }\n```",
