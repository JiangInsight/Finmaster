Thus, the **Initial Accounts Payable Value** is `0.00`.\n\n2. **Identify Transactions that Affect Accounts Payable**: \n   We will look for entries classified as \"Purchase\" that have the \"payment/receipt_status\" of \"Unpaid\" since those represent obligations that have not been settled yet.\n\n   - Examining the transactions, we find:\n     - For `Purchase20231231001`, there is an account payable amount of **540000.0** with `payment/receipt_status` as \"Paid\".\n     - For `Purchase20231231005`, there is an account payable amount of **1200000.0** with `payment/receipt_status` as \"Unpaid\".\n     - For `Purchase20231231006`, there is an account payable amount of **520000.0** with `payment/receipt_status` as \"Paid\".\n     - For `Purchase20231231007`, there is an account payable amount of **1300000.0** with `payment/receipt_status` as \"Paid\". \n\n3. **Calculate Final Accounts Payable**:\n   - We only consider the amounts with `payment/receipt_status` as \"Unpaid\".\n   - Total unpaid amount = **1200000.0**\n   \n   Hence, the **Final Accounts Payable Value** is `1200000.00`.\n\nSummarizing this, we have:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Payable End Value': '1200000.00'} }\n```",
