In the provided dataset, liabilities will generally include outstanding purchases (from suppliers) and any expenses that are unpaid, specifically those with the payment status labeled as \"Unpaid\".\n\n### Step 1: Identify Current Liabilities from the Data\n\n1. **Outstanding Purchases**: Look for purchases with payment statuses that indicate they are unpaid.\n2. **Outstanding Expenses**: Look for any expenses that have not been paid, which may contribute to accounts payable.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Relevant Data\n\nFrom the given transactions:\n\n- **Purchases** (with 'Unpaid' status):\n    - Purchase ID: `Purchase20231231005` \n      - Amount: `460000.0`\n      - Payment Status: `Unpaid`\n\n- **Other Expenses** (assumed to be related to accounts payable):\n    - Purchase ID: `Purchase20231231011`\n      - Amount: `850000.0`\n      - Payment Status: `Unpaid`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Current Liabilities\n\nNow, we sum up:\n- Total Unpaid Purchases = `460000.0 + 850000.0 = 1310000.0`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Initial and Final Values\n\n1. **Initial Current Liabilities**: As inferred from the initial entries, they account for zero initial liabilities.\n2. **Final Current Liabilities**: The total unpaid amount is what we have calculated.\n\n### Step 5: Format the Result as Required\n\nThe calculations yield:\n\n- **Total Current Liabilities Initial Value**: `0.00`\n- **Total Current Liabilities End Value**: `1310000.0`\n\nFinally, we format the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Current Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Current Liabilities End Value': '1310000.00'}}\n```",
