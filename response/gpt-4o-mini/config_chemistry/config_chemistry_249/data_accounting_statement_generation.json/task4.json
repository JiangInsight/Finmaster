                        "content": "To calculate the accounts receivable on the balance sheet based on the given transaction data, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Initial Accounts Receivable\n\nAccounts Receivable (AR) represents the amounts owed to a company by its customers for products or services sold on credit. Initially, we start with an AR balance of $0.00 since no transactions have taken place yet.\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Sum Relevant Transactions\n\nWe need to look through the transaction data and identify the relevant sales that affect accounts receivable:\n\n1. **Sales Made on Credit**: Only those sales which have `payment/receipt_status` as \"Unpaid\" or `payment_method` indicating 'Account Receivable' need to be summed up to determine the end AR.\n\n2. **Sales Transactions**: These are recorded under the column `type`, and we are particularly looking at sales that do not have cash payment (i.e., the `payment/receipt_status` is not marked as \"Paid\").\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Transactions\n\nLet's go through the transactions in the provided data and summarize the relevant information affecting accounts receivable:\n\n- **Unpaid Sales or Sales on Account**:\n    - Sale20240104004: $349296.60\n    - Sale20240108011: $134712.58\n    - Sale20240109012: $561752.55\n    - Sale20240110013: $11994.85\n    - Sale20240113021: $115227.49\n    - Sale20240117030: $47872.60\n    - Sale20240122041: $48657.34\n    - Sale20240124044: $12903.89\n    - Sale20240125047: $245247.36\n    - Sale20240129052: $264497.76\n    - Sale20240129053: $51823.64\n    - Sale20240130054: $122266.78\n    - Sale20240131057: $128337.12\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Accounts Receivable\n\nNow let's calculate the total accounts receivable by summing up the values from the identified transactions:\n\n```plaintext\nOverall AR = 349296.60 + 134712.58 + 561752.55 + 11994.85 \n+ 115227.49 + 47872.60 + 48657.34 + 12903.89 \n+ 245247.36 + 264497.76 + 51823.64 + 122266.78 + 128337.12\n```\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n- Overall AR = 1,978,196.67\n\n### Step 5: Prepare the Result\n\n- **Initial Accounts Receivable Value:** $0.00 (initially)\n- **End Accounts Receivable Value:** $1,978,196.67 (after all transactions)\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\nCombining the results:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accounts Receivable End Value': '1978196.67'} }\n```",
