For example, if a transaction is marked as a \"Sale,\" it should have a recorded method of receipt (e.g., cash, credit) that aligns with a sale's nature.\n   - The profit calculated as `recorded_after_tax_amount - recorded_cost_amount` should logically align. If it doesn't, that presents a potential inconsistency.\n\n2. **Invoice Validation**:\n   - An invoice mentions specific amounts that should match the recorded amounts in various fields, including the total amount and the breakdown of cost, tax, and profit.\n\n3. **Date Validation**:\n   - Ensure that the date aligns with expected business rules, such as whether actions occurring after a transaction date specified are valid.\n\nAfter going through the transactions provided, the following inconsistencies were found:\n\n- **Sale20240114023**: \n   - **Calculated Recorded Profit**: 54144.8\n   - **Recorded Profit**: 61727.59\n   - This presents a discrepancy showing a potential recording error.\n\nRecording the details of the issues found:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {\n    'Original category': 'Sale',\n    'Recorded category': 'Sale',\n    'Original date': '2024-01-14',\n    'Recorded date': '2024-01-14',\n    'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid',\n    'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid',\n    'Original payment_method': 'Account Receivable',\n    'Recorded payment_method': 'Account Receivable',\n    'Original quantity': '5.0',\n    'Recorded quantity': '5.0',\n    'Original price': '60828.96',\n    'Recorded price': '60828.96',\n    'Original receive_method': 'Account Receivable',\n    'Recorded receive_method': 'Account Receivable',\n    'Original amount': '304144.8',\n    'Recorded amount': '304144.80',\n    'Original tax': '15207.24',\n    'Recorded tax': '15207.24',\n    'Original profit': '54144.8',\n    'Recorded profit': '61727.59',\n    'Original Preparer': 'Staff',\n    'Recorded Preparer': 'Staff',\n    'Original Approver': 'Director',\n    'Recorded Approver': 'Director',\n    'id': 'Sale20240114023'\n}}\n``` \n\nThis identifies the original and recorded values along with the transaction ID, highlighting discrepancies for further examination or correction within the records.",
