Here’s the breakdown:\n\n1. **Total Assets**: This is given in the balance sheet.\n   - Total Assets = 12,566,098.56\n\n2. **Total Liabilities**: This can be derived from the Total Liabilities and Owner's Equity or computed by adding the total current liabilities.\n   - Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable = 1,260,000.00 + 341,835.08 = 1,601,835.08\n   - Since there are no other liabilities mentioned, we will assume that the Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n\n3. **Debt to Asset Ratio Calculation**:\n   - Debt to Asset Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n   - Debt to Asset Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 12,566,098.56\n\nNow performing the calculation:\n```python\nDebt to Asset Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 12,566,098.56\n                    ≈ 0.127\n```\n\nFinally, rounding to two decimal places, the Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.13. \n\nNow, construct the JSON output:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.13'}}\n```",
