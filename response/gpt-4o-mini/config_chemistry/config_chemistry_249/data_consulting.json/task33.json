                        "content": "To solve the problem, we will calculate the following ratios based on the provided financial statements:\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities\n   - Operating Cash Flow = Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,856,840.58\n   - Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 1,601,835.08\n   - Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Formula: Operating Cash Flow / Total Liabilities\n   - Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities + Total Non-current Liabilities\n   - In this case, only current liabilities are provided, as there's no separate line for long-term liabilities.\n   - Total Liabilities = 1,601,835.08 (this is what we have as it appears to be zero for long-term liabilities)\n   - Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08\n\n3. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**:\n   - Formula: Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n   - Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\n   - Beginning Inventory = 0, Ending Inventory = 3,420,000.00\n   - Average Inventory = (0 + 3,420,000.00) / 2 = 1,710,000.00\n   - Inventory Turnover Ratio = 5,700,000.00 / 1,710,000.00\n\n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**:\n   - Formula: Total Liabilities / Total Owner's Equity\n   - Total Owner's Equity = 10,964,263.48\n   - Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48\n\n5. **Quick Ratio**:\n   - Formula: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n   - Current Assets = 7,000,260.27, Inventory = 3,420,000.00\n   - Quick Ratio = (7,000,260.27 - 3,420,000.00) / 1,601,835.08\n\n6. **Current Ratio**:\n   - Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n   - Current Ratio = 7,000,260.27 / 1,601,835.08\n\nNow we can calculate these ratios:\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - Operating Cash Flow Ratio = -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ -4.28\n\n2. **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   - Cash Flow to Debt Ratio = -6,856,840.58 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ -4.28 \n\n3. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**:\n   - Inventory Turnover Ratio = 5,700,000.00 / 1,710,000.00 ≈ 3.34\n \n4. **Debt to Equity Ratio**:\n   - Debt to Equity Ratio = 1,601,835.08 / 10,964,263.48 ≈ 0.15\n\n5. **Quick Ratio**:\n   - Quick Ratio = (7,000,260.27 - 3,420,000.00) / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 2.23\n\n6. **Current Ratio**:\n   - Current Ratio = 7,000,260.27 / 1,601,835.08 ≈ 4.37\n\nFinally, I will represent these results in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-4.28', 'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-4.28', 'Inventory Turnover Ratio': '3.34', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.15', 'Quick Ratio': '2.23', 'Current Ratio': '4.37'} }\n```",
