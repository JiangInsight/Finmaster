According to the provided cash flow statement:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -6,856,840.58\n\n2. **Calculate Total Debt**:\n   - Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities \n   - From the balance sheet, the total current liabilities can be identified as the sum of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable:\n     - Accounts Payable = 1,260,000.00\n     - Taxes Payable = 341,835.08\n     - Total Current Liabilities = 1,260,000.00 + 341,835.08 = 1,601,835.08\n\n   - Since there are no additional long-term debts mentioned separate from this total liabilities in the provided balance sheet, we will use this amount as total debt.\n\n3. **Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio**:\n   The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Debt}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-6,856,840.58}{1,601,835.08}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   - Calculating the division:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = -4.28 \\quad (\\text{approximately})\n   \\]\n\nLet's present this calculation as a JSON formatted answer.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-4.28'} }\n```",
