The income arising from the entity's core operating activities, which is represented by \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue\".\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, which correlates with \"Cost of Goods Sold\".\n\nLet's look at the given income statement details:\n\n| Account                 | Amount      | Date       |\n|------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| Main Business Revenue   | 6836701.10  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Total Revenue           | 6836701.10  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold      | 5700000.00  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Total Cost              | 5700000.00  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Gross Profit            | 1136701.10  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Administrative Expenses  | 1600726.63  | 2024-02-01 |\n| Selling Expenses        | 477715.85   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Depreciation            | 100239.89   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Financial Expenses      | 657075.51   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Total Expenses          | 2835757.88   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Interest Income         | 5155.34     | 2024-02-01 |\n| Profit Before Tax       | -1693901.44 | 2024-02-01 |\n| Tax Expense             | 341835.08   | 2024-02-01 |\n| Net Profit              | -2035736.52 | 2024-02-01 |\n\nFrom this table, we can identify:\n- **Income from core operating activities (value1)**: This is represented by \"Main Business Revenue\", which is **6836701.10**.\n- **Carrying amount of inventories sold (value2)**: This is represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold\", which is **5700000.00**.\n\nNow we can organize our findings into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6836701.10', 'value2': '5700000.00'}}\n```",
