                        "content": "To identify the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers from the provided income statement, we need to focus on the relevant line items that typically include costs directly associated with producing and delivering products, as well as selling expenses. \n\nHere’s a breakdown of the relevant line items from the income statement:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This is a direct measure of the costs associated with producing the goods that were sold during the period. This includes materials and labor directly tied to product creation, which is part of securing orders as well as delivering the goods.\n   - COGS: **5700000.00**\n\n2. **Selling Expenses**: These are costs related to selling the products, which can include marketing, sales staff compensation, and other expenses directly aimed at pushing products into the market or securing customer orders.\n   - Selling Expenses: **477715.85**\n\nNow we will sum these two amounts to determine the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods/services:\n\n- Total Costs = Cost of Goods Sold + Selling Expenses\n- Total Costs = 5700000.00 + 477715.85 = **6177715.85**\n\nHowever, the task specifically requests us to extract either the specific line items or just their values but does not indicate that we need to compute a grand total. Therefore, we will showcase the relevant “Selling Expenses” amount as the extracted value, since it directly relates to costs incurred for securing orders.\n\nThus, the output would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '477715.85'} }\n```",
