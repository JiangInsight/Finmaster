                        "content": "To identify and extract the specific line item and value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers, we need to review the income statement provided.\n\nThe relevant line item for costs incurred to deliver goods and services to customers is typically \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS). This line item directly represents the costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company.\n\nLet's look at the income statement:\n\n### income statement\n| Account                         | Amount       | Date          |\n|---------------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Main Business Revenue           | 6836701.10   | 2024-02-01    |\n| Total Revenue                   | 6836701.10   | 2024-02-01    |\n| **Cost of Goods Sold**         | **5700000.00**| 2024-02-01    |\n| Total Cost                      | 5700000.00   | 2024-02-01    |\n| Gross Profit                    | 1136701.10   | 2024-02-01    |\n| Administrative Expenses          | 1600726.63   | 2024-02-01    |\n| Selling Expenses                | 477715.85    | 2024-02-01    |\n| Depreciation                    | 100239.89    | 2024-02-01    |\n| Financial Expenses               | 657075.51    | 2024-02-01    |\n| Total Expenses                   | 2835757.88   | 2024-02-01    |\n| Interest Income                  | 5155.34      | 2024-02-01    |\n| Profit Before Tax               | -1693901.44  | 2024-02-01    |\n| Tax Expense                     | 341835.08    | 2024-02-01    |\n| Net Profit                      | -2035736.52  | 2024-02-01    |\n\nFrom the table, we see that the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) is listed as **5700000.00**. This figure represents the costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers.\n\nThus, we can encapsulate our finding in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5700000.00'}}\n```",
