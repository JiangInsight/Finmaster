The line item we are interested in is \"Paid-in Capital.\"\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Value**: This is the value of paid-in capital at the initial date (2023-12-31). According to the balance sheet, the initial amount for \"Paid-in Capital\" is **13000000.00**.\n  \n2. **End Value**: This is the value of paid-in capital at the end date (2024-02-01). The end amount for \"Paid-in Capital\" is also **13000000.00**.\n\nSince both the initial and end values of the paid-in capital are the same, the contributions from shareholders, in this case, did not change during the period.\n\nFinally, we format the findings in the specified JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
