                        "content": "To solve the task of extracting the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period from the provided income statement, we need to identify the relevant line items concerning the cost of inventories.\n\nLooking at the given income statement:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 6836701.10\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 5700000.00\n- **Total Cost**: 5700000.00\n\nFrom this information, we can see that the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line item represents the total cost associated with the goods that were sold, including inventories. Since this is the key indicator of the carrying amount of inventories sold, we will focus on this value.\n\nNo further deductions are indicated in the problem about other line items specifically linked to inventories outside of COGS.\n\nThus, the carrying amount of inventories sold during this reporting period is represented by the amount in the \"Cost of Goods Sold,\" which is:\n\n5700000.00\n\nFollowing the required format for the solution, we write the final answer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5700000.00'} }\n```",
