First, we look for the line item that mentions accounts receivable since this item typically represents amounts owed to the entity for goods or services sold on credit.\n  \n2. In the cash flow statement, we see the following line:\n   - **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**: This is the relevant line item for our task.\n\n3. Next, we examine the amount associated with this line item:\n   - The line reads: **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable  | -3098023.69 | 2024-02-01**.\n   - The amount is **-3098023.69**.\n\n4. This negative value indicates a decrease in accounts receivable, which means that the amounts owed to the entity for goods or services have decreased during the period.\n\n5. Therefore, our extracted value for the specific line item regarding the decrease in amounts owed is **-3098023.69**.\n\nNow we will present the final answer in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3098023.69'} }\n```",
