The amount attributed to the increase (or decrease) in accounts payable, which reflects the addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period.\n2. The amount associated with the purchase of fixed assets, which represents the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment.\n3. The beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents for the period, reflecting the liquidity position at the start.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n\n- **Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable**: The relevant line item is \"Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable\" with an amount of **1260000.00**.\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: The relevant line item is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" with an amount of **666078.18**.\n- **Beginning Balance**: The relevant line item is \"Beginning Balance\" under \"Cash and Cash Equivalents,\" which shows an amount of **8000000.00**.\n\nNow, I'll format the solution according to the specified JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '1260000.00', 'value2': '666078.18', 'value3': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
