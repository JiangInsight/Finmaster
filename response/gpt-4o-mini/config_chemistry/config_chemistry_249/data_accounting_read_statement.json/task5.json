This is typically where these categories of assets are recorded.\n\nLet's analyze the provided balance sheet:\n\n- **Inventory**: \n  - Initial Amount: 0.00\n  - End Amount: 3,420,000.00\n\nFrom this analysis, we can determine that:\n\n- The initial value of assets held for sale or in production was 0.00.\n- The ending value of assets held for sale or in production is 3,420,000.00.\n\nThus, our answer format will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3420000.00'} }\n``` \n\nThis indicates that there were no assets in inventory at the start of the period, and by the end of the period, they had increased to 3,420,000.00.",
