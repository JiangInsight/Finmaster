In this balance sheet, \"Taxes Payable\" shows an amount of **341835.08**.\n   \n   - **Cash Flow Statement**: We check for \"Increase (Decrease) in Tax Payable.\" This shows how the taxes payable have changed, and in this case, it indicates an increase of **341835.08**.\n   \n   - **Income Statement**: We look at the \"Tax Expense,\" which usually indicates the total tax the entity is expected to pay for the period. Here, it shows a tax expense of **341835.08**.\n\n3. **Verification**: The tax figures mentioned in different statements are consistent:\n   - The balance sheet tax payable matches the cash flow increase and the income statement tax expense. Therefore, it confirms that the entity expects to pay or recover an amount of **341835.08** during the reporting period.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we conclude that the total amount of tax expected to be paid is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '341835.08'} }\n```",
