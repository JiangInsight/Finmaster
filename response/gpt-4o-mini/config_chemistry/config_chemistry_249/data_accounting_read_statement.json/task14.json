The relevant accounts for current liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle are:\n   - Accounts Payable\n   - Taxes Payable\n   - Total Current Liabilities\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - For **Accounts Payable**:\n     - Initial Amount: 0.00\n     - End Amount: 1260000.00\n   - For **Taxes Payable**:\n     - Initial Amount: 0.00\n     - End Amount: 341835.08\n   - **Total Current Liabilities**:\n     - Initial Amount: 0.00\n     - End Amount: 1601835.08\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Current Liabilities**:\n   The total current liabilities reported in the balance sheet for the end amount is already provided as 1601835.08. This represents the sum of all accounts payable or obligations expected to be settled shortly.\n\n4. **Initial Value**: The initial value of total current liabilities is explicitly mentioned as 0.00, which indicates that there were no current liabilities at the start of the reporting period.\n\n5. **Final Value**: The end value of total current liabilities is 1601835.08, representing the amount that is expected to be paid in the upcoming operating cycle.\n\nNow, I can format the solution according to the specified JSON structure.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1601835.08'} }\n```",
