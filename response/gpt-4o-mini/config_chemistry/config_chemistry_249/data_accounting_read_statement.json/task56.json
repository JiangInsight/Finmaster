However, this figure does not represent a single period's depreciation but rather the total accumulated depreciation to date.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement**: \n   - The line item \"Depreciation\" appears in the cash flow statement with a value of `100239.89`. This represents the systematic allocation for the reporting period.\n\n3. **Income Statement**:\n   - The \"Depreciation\" line also appears in the income statement with the same value of `100239.89`.\n\nThe line item depicting the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life for the current period is represented as follows:\n\n**Depreciation**: `100239.89`\n\nThus, the depreciation value for this asset over its useful life for the reporting period is `100239.89`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is formulated as:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '100239.89'} }\n```",
