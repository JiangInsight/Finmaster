These typically include \"Accounts Payable\" and any other applicable liabilities related to credit purchases.\n\n1. **Examine the Balance Sheet**: \n   We will look for entries that represent amounts owed. \n   - **Accounts Payable** is a clear indicator of credits and liabilities.\n   - **Taxes Payable** can also represent amounts owed, but usually pertains to tax obligations rather than credit purchases.\n   \n2. **Identify Relevant Line Items**:\n   - **Accounts Payable**: \n     - Initial Amount: **0.00**\n     - End Amount: **1260000.00**\n   - **Taxes Payable**:\n     - Initial Amount: **0.00**\n     - End Amount: **341835.08** (while this is a liability, it is not specifically for goods and services but for taxes)\n   \n   To solve the problem, we focus primarily on the \"Accounts Payable\" line as it directly pertains to amounts owed for goods or services received on credit.\n\n3. **Gather Values**:\n   From the \"Accounts Payable\" line:\n   - Initial Value: **0.00**\n   - End Value: **1260000.00**\n\n4. **Construct the Final Output**:\n   We will present the values in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '1260000.00'} }\n```",
