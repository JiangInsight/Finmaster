However, the balance sheet typically doesn't provide direct information on these costs. We also need to identify any cash payments related to property, plant, and equipment.\n\nUpon reviewing the balance sheet:\n- No line items specifically pertain to costs incurred for customer orders.\n- The \"Fixed Assets\" line in the balance sheet signifies the acquisition of long-term assets (but we will find the actual cash payment in the cash flow statement).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Income Statement\nIn the income statement, we need to extract:\n1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): This typically involves costs related to delivering goods/services.\n2. Selling Expenses: This can include costs related to securing customer orders.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Cost of Goods Sold** is **5700000.00**.\n- **Selling Expenses** is **477715.85**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Cash Flow Statement\nWe will look for cash payments related to property, plant, and equipment:\n- The cash flow from investing activities indicates payments for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\".\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- **Purchase of Fixed Assets** is **666078.18**.\n\n### Summary of Extracted Values\nNow we summarize the values we've identified:\n1. Line item for costs incurred to deliver goods/services: Selling Expenses = **477715.85**.\n2. Line item for costs incurred to deliver goods/services: Cost of Goods Sold = **5700000.00**.\n3. Cash payment for acquiring property, plant, and equipment: Purchase of Fixed Assets = **666078.18**.\n\n### Step 4: Format the Results\nThe final extracted values we need to present under the proper line items are:\n- From the Income Statement, **Cost of Goods Sold** = **5700000.00** (relating to delivering goods/services).\n- From the Cash Flow Statement, **Purchase of Fixed Assets** = **666078.18** (cash payment for long-term assets).\n\nThe outputs fit into the solution format as:\n- **value1:** 477715.85 (Selling Expenses) — capturing costs associated with securing customer orders\n- **value2:** 666078.18 (Purchase of Fixed Assets) — capturing cash payment for acquiring long-term assets\n\n### Final Answer\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '477715.85', 'value2': '666078.18'} }\n```",
