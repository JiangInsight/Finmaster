Start with the provided income statement data:\n   - **Tax Expense**: This is the line we are interested in because it reflects the total tax amount (either paid or recoverable) for the reporting period.\n\n2. Extract the value associated with the **Tax Expense**:\n   The value next to **Tax Expense** is **341835.08**.\n\n3. Format the extracted value into the required JSON structure.\n\nThe result would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '341835.08'}}\n```",
