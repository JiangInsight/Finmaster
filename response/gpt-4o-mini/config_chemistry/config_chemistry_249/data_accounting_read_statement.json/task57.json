These represent the amounts owed.\n\n### Step 1: Extracting Relevant Information \n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- **Accounts Payable** (a liability representing goods or services bought on credit):\n  - Initial Amount: 0.00\n  - End Amount: 1260000.00\n- **Taxes Payable** (a liability representing taxes owed):\n  - Initial Amount: 0.00\n  - End Amount: 341835.08\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Increase\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**: \n   - Increase = End Amount - Initial Amount = 1260000.00 - 0.00 = 1260000.00\n\n2. **Taxes Payable**: \n   - Increase = End Amount - Initial Amount = 341835.08 - 0.00 = 341835.08\n\n### Step 3: Total Increase in Liabilities\n\nNow we sum the increases from both accounts to find the total addition in the amount owed by the entity:\n\n- Total Increase = Increase in Accounts Payable + Increase in Taxes Payable  \n               = 1260000.00 + 341835.08  \n               = 1601835.08\n\n### Prepare Output\n\nWe will present the final total increase in liabilities reflecting the addition amount owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit in the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1601835.08'} }\n```",
