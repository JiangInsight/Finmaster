Our goal is to identify the specific line item that represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, which is typically denoted as \"Depreciation.\"\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n1. Review the income statement presented in the problem:\n   - Main Business Revenue: 6836701.10\n   - Total Revenue: 6836701.10\n   - Cost of Goods Sold: 5700000.00\n   - Total Cost: 5700000.00\n   - Gross Profit: 1136701.10\n   - Administrative Expenses: 1600726.63\n   - Selling Expenses: 477715.85\n   - **Depreciation: 100239.89**  (this is our focal line item)\n   - Financial Expenses: 657075.51\n   - Total Expenses: 2835757.88\n   - Interest Income: 5155.34\n   - Profit Before Tax: -1693901.44\n   - Tax Expense: 341835.08\n   - Net Profit: -2035736.52\n\n2. Identify the line item relevant for our task:\n   - The line item for \"Depreciation\" is clearly marked and corresponds to the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset.\n\n3. Extract the value associated with the Depreciation line item:\n   - The value for Depreciation is **100239.89**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWe have successfully identified the depreciation amount from the income statement.\n\nThus, the final answer must be formatted as specified:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '100239.89'} }\n```",
