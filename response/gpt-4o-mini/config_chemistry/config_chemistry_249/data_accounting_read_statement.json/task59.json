However, we only need this figure once as it is essentially the same element reflected in different contexts.\n\n2. **Identify line items related to \"net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period\":**\n   - This is usually captured in the **Cash Flow Statement**, specifically under the \"Net Increase\" in cash and cash equivalents.\n   - From the **Cash Flow Statement**, the \"Net Increase\" is **-7522918.76**.\n\nNow, organizing these findings according to the specified format:\n\n### Financial Statement Summary\n- **Balance Sheet**:\n  - Interest Receivable: 5155.34\n\n- **Income Statement**:\n  - Interest Income: 5155.34 (not extracted, as already counted)\n\n- **Cash Flow Statement**:\n  - Net Increase: -7522918.76\n\nNow, I will format this extracted information into the required JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5155.34', 'value2': '-7522918.76'} }\n```",
