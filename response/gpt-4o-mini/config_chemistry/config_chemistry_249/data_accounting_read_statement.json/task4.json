We will focus on this line item.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**: From the provided balance sheet, the line for \"Interest Receivable\" has the following values:\n   - Initial Amount: 0.00\n   - End Amount: 5155.34\n\n3. **Format the Extracted Data**: According to the required JSON format, we will structure the solution to present the initial and end values of \"Interest Receivable.\"\n\nNow, let's compile this information into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '5155.34'} }\n```",
