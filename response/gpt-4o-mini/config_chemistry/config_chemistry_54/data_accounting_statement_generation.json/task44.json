Typically, these records may include a specific note in the type or asset name fields that specify they are for fixed assets.\n\n2. **Review of Fixed Asset Purchases**:\n   - From the presented dataset, we note the following entries that correspond to fixed asset purchases:\n\n   ```\n   FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 230120.87 | 230120.87 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S002 | Supplier 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Storage Facilities4 | Storage Facilities\n   FixedAsset20231231001 | Fixed Assets Purchase | 2023-12-31 | 2023-12-31 | 351585.3 | 351585.3 |  |  | Paid | Bank Transfer |  | S010 | Supplier 10 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Processing Equipment6 | Processing Equipment\n   ```\n\n3. **Calculation of Total Fixed Assets Purchases**:\n   - Now we calculate the total amount spent on these fixed assets:\n     - First entry amount: **230120.87**\n     - Second entry amount: **351585.3**\n   - Total Fixed Assets Purchases:\n     ```\n     Total = 230120.87 + 351585.3 = 581706.17\n     ```\n\n### Final Output\nIn our JSON format, we present the total as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Purchase of Fixed Assets': '581706.17'} }\n```",
