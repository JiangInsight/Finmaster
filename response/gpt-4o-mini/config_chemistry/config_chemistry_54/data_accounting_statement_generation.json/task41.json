                        "content": "To calculate the overall change in accounts payable for the submitted transactions, we will need to analyze the purchases made on account and the corresponding payments made. The increase in accounts payable will occur from any purchases made but not yet paid, while the decrease will happen when payments to suppliers are made.\n\nLetâ€™s analyze the relevant transactions:\n\n1. **Purchases on Account**: These are recorded with the status as \"Unpaid\".\n2. **Payments**: These contribute to decreasing accounts payable when the respective amounts are settled.\n\n### Analyzing Transactions\n\n#### Purchases\n- **Purchase20231231001**: Amount = 1,100,000.00 (Unpaid)\n- **Purchase20231231002**: Amount = 240,000.00 (Paid)\n- **Purchase20231231003**: Amount = 90,000.00 (Unpaid)\n- **Purchase20231231004**: Amount = 300,000.00 (Paid)\n- **Purchase20231231005**: Amount = 320,000.00 (Paid)\n- **Purchase20231231006**: Amount = 850,000.00 (Paid)\n- **Purchase20231231010**: Amount = 1,700,000.00 (Paid)\n- **Purchase20231231011**: Amount = 1,400,000.00 (Paid)\n- **Purchase20231231012**: Amount = 60,000.00 (Paid)\n- **Purchase20231231013**: Amount = 340,000.00 (Paid)\n\n#### Paid Transactions\n- We will track all the amounts paid that affect the accounts payable.\n\n### Steps to Calculate Accounts Payable\n\n1. **Total Purchases on Account**:\n   - Unpaid Purchases:\n     - Purchase20231231001: 1,100,000.00 (Unpaid)\n     - Purchase20231231003: 90,000.00 (Unpaid)\n   - Total Unpaid Purchases = 1,100,000.00 + 90,000.00 = 1,190,000.00\n\n2. **Total Payments Made** (These will decrease the accounts payable):\n   - Purchase20231231002: 240,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase20231231004: 300,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase20231231005: 320,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase20231231006: 850,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase20231231010: 1,700,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase20231231011: 1,400,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase20231231012: 60,000.00 (Paid)\n   - Purchase20231231003: 90,000.00 (Paid)\n   \n   Total Paid =240,000 + 300,000 + 320,000 + 850,000 + 1,700,000 + 1,400,000 + 60,000 = 4,860,000.00\n\n3. **Increase in Accounts Payable** = Total Unpaid - Total Paid\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Change in Accounts Payable} = \\text{Total Unpaid Purchases} - \\text{Total Paid}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Change in Accounts Payable} = 1,190,000.00 - 4,860,000.00 = -3,670,000.00\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThis shows there is a decrease in the accounts payable, meaning the company has paid more than what remains outstanding.\n\nTherefore, in the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Increase (Decrease) in Accounts Payable': '-3670000.00'}}\n```",
