                        "content": "To calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) based on the provided transaction data, we will focus on the purchase and sale transactions concerning the relevant products.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify Purchases Related to Goods Sold:**\n   - We need to gather all purchase transactions that correspond to the sold products concerning their quantities and costs.\n\n2. **List of Purchases:**\n   - We can see entries indicating purchases:\n     - 1100000.0 for Chemical Product C (P003)\n     - 240000.0 for Chemical Product B (P002)\n     - 90000.0 for Chemical Product A (P001)\n     - 300000.0 for Chemical Product A (P001)\n     - 1700000.0 for Chemical Product D (P004)\n\n3. **Identify Sales Transactions:**\n   - Next, we look at the sales transactions which indicate how much of each product was sold:\n     - Sales figures related to each product provide the quantity sold and their related revenue.\n\n4. **Calculating Relevant COGS:**\n   - From the purchase amounts and the quantities sold, we can calculate the cost associated with the goods that were sold. \n   - COGS will include all product costs incurred for products that were sold during the period under review.\n\n### Calculation Breakdown:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold Calculation for each Product:**\n  - For each sold product, take the quantity sold, find the unit cost from the purchases, multiply them to get the total cost.\n\n**Example Calculations:**\n- For Product C (sold 10 units):\n  - Last purchase unit cost from the purchases: \\(50000.0 / 22.0 = 2272.73\\)\n  - COGS For Product C: \\(10 \\text{ units} * 2272.73 = 22727.3\\)\n\n- For Product B (sold 15 units):\n  - Last purchase unit cost from the purchases: \\(20000.0 / 12.0 = 1666.67\\)\n  - COGS For Product B: \\(15 \\text{ units} * 1666.67 = 25000.05\\)\n\n- For Product A (sold 10 units):\n  - Last purchase unit cost from the purchases: \\(10000.0 / 9.0 = 1111.11\\)\n  - COGS For Product A: \\(10 \\text{ units} * 1111.11 = 11111.1\\)\n\n- For Product D (sold 5 units):\n  - Last purchase unit cost from the purchases: \\(100000.0 / 17.0 = 5882.35\\)\n  - COGS For Product D: \\(5 \\text{ units} * 5882.35 = 29411.75\\)\n\n### Summing COGS\n- Finally, sum all these costs for COGS:\n\n\\[ \nCOGS = COGS Product A + COGS Product B + COGS Product C + COGS Product D \n= 11111.1 + 25000.05 + 22727.3 + 29411.75 = 88249.1\n\\]\n\n### Final Result:\nThe total Cost of Goods Sold is calculated to be `'88249.1'`.\n\nThus, the answer in the required format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cost of Goods Sold': '88249.10'} }\n```",
