Based on the data provided, the relevant transactions are:\n\n1. **Initial Deposits**:\n   - Cash deposit of **3,000,000**\n   - Bank deposit of **5,000,000**\n   - Fixed assets capital (also effectively contributing to capital) of **5,000,000**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Initial Paid-in Capital\nThe initial paid-in capital is simply the sum of the contributions made at the start.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial Paid-in Capital} = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find End of Period Paid-in Capital\nThe end period paid-in capital will ideally remain the same if no new capital is added or withdrawn. Ideally, based on the provided data we can deduce that other transactions (purchases or sales) will not impact the paid-in capital directly.\n\nAs no additional capital contributions or withdrawals are evident in the data, we assume the capital remains unchanged.\n\n\\[\n\\text{End Paid-in Capital} = 13,000,000\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Finalize Output\nConsidering that we have calculated both initial and final paid-in capital as the same, we can conclude the solution.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
