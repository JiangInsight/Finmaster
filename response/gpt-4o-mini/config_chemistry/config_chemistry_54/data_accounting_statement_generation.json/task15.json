The 'Paid' transactions do not contribute to any outstanding liabilities.\n\n4. **Summarizing the Results**:\n    - Initial Total Liabilities: 0.00\n    - Final Total Liabilities: 5,190,000.0\n\nWith this analysis, we can present the final answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '5190000.00'} }\n```",
