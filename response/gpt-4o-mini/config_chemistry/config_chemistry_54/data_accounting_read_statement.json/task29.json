From the data, we find that the total revenue is **6920513.79**.\n\n2. **Extract Sub-item for Total Income:**\n   The \"Total Revenue\" is comprised of \"Main Business Revenue\", which is also listed as **6920513.79** in the income statement.\n   \n3. **Prepare the output in the required format:**\n   The value for total income will be \"6920513.79\" and we will also identify that the only sub-item (which is the detail of the total income) is \"Main Business Revenue\" with the same value of **6920513.79**.\n\nNow, I'll compile this information into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6920513.79', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '6920513.79'}} }\n```",
