                        "content": "To solve the task, we need to extract the relevant information from the provided income statement and break down the Net Profit into its component sub-items.\n\nLet's go through the line items step by step:\n\n1. **Total Revenue**: This represents the total amount generated from the entity's operations. The value here is `6920513.79`.\n\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This is the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the entity. The value is `5580000.00`.\n\n3. **Gross Profit**: This is calculated as Total Revenue minus Cost of Goods Sold. The value is obtained directly from the statement, which indicates it is `1340513.79`.\n\n4. **Total Expenses**: This includes Administrative Expenses, Selling Expenses, Depreciation, and Financial Expenses. The value is `2666904.55`.\n\n5. **Interest Income**: This represents income from interest earned on investments or similar sources.

It is given as `-1323824.05`.\n\n7. **Tax Expense**: The amount that the entity pays in taxes, which is `346025.72`.\n\n8. **Net Profit**: This is the final profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. The provided net profit value is `-1669849.77`.\n\n### Breakdown of Net Profit\nLet's now break down Net Profit into its component sub-items:\n- **Sub-item value1**: Total Revenue `6920513.79`\n- **Sub-item value2**: Cost of Goods Sold `5580000.00`\n- **Sub-item value3**: Total Expenses `2666904.55`\n- **Sub-item value4**: Interest Income `2566.71`\n- **Sub-item value5**: Tax Expense `346025.72`\n\n### Final Output\nNow we compile all this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1669849.77', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '6920513.79', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '5580000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value3': '2666904.55', 'sub_items_sub_item value4': '2566.71', 'sub_items_sub_item value5': '346025.72'}}\n```",
