Analyze the cash flow statement data provided:\n   - Various activities are reported under \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities,\" \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" and \"Cash and Cash Equivalents.\"\n\n2. Focus on the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section to identify line items that relate to the reduction in the amount of assets held for sale:\n   - The relevant line item indicating a reduction in assets (specifically inventory, which reflects assets held for sale) is:\n     - **(Increase) Decrease in Inventory**: -3900000.00\n\n3. In the context of cash flow statements, an increase in inventory is represented as a use of cash (hence negative), indicating that the company has reduced the amount of assets (inventory) available for sale during the period.\n\n4. Therefore, the value we're interested in is the amount associated with this line item.\n\n5. Summarizing our findings:\n   - The reduction in the inventory (which corresponds to the assets held for sale) is -3900000.00.\n\nNow, we can present the answer in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3900000.00'} }\n```",
