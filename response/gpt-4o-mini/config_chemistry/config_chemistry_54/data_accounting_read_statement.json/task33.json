In this case, it has the value of **6920513.79**.\n\n2. **Identifying the Carrying Amount of Inventories Sold:** The line item labeled \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) represents the costs directly associated with the goods that were sold during the reporting period. This value is **5580000.00**.\n\nNow, we will extract these values and format them in the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '6920513.79', 'value2': '5580000.00'} }\n```",
