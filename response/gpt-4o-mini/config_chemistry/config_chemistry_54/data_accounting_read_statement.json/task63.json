The net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from operational activities (as reported in the Cash Flow Statement).\n2. The amounts of taxes accrued but not yet paid (as reported in the Balance Sheet).\n3. The total income arising in the course of the entityâ€™s ordinary activities (as reported in the Income Statement).\n\nNow we will analyze each financial statement and extract the relevant values:\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\nFrom the Balance Sheet, we locate the line item \"Taxes Payable\":\n- **Taxes Payable**: **346025.72**\n\n### 2. Income Statement\nIn the Income Statement, we pay attention to the \"Total Revenue\" line item which reflects the total income from ordinary activities:\n- **Total Revenue**: **6920513.79**\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nFinally, we refer to the Cash Flow Statement to determine the net cash flow from operating activities, specifically from the \"Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\":\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: **-5714107.45**\n\nNow let's compile these extracted values into the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '346025.72', 'value2': '6920513.79', 'value3': '-5714107.45'}}\n```",
