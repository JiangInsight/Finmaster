This reflects the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company.\n   - The line item \"Selling Expenses\" can also be relevant as it often includes costs incurred to secure customer orders (like sales commissions, advertising, etc.).\n\n2. **Extract Values**:\n   - Looking at the income statement:\n     - **Cost of Goods Sold**: The value is 5580000.00\n     - **Selling Expenses**: The value is 630420.28\n\n3. **Calculate Total Costs**:\n   - The total costs associated with securing customer orders and delivering goods can be calculated as:\n     - Total Costs = Cost of Goods Sold + Selling Expenses\n     - Total Costs = 5580000.00 + 630420.28 = 6210420.28\n\n4. **Presenting the Solution**:\n   - Since the task asks for the specific line item for costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services, we prioritize listing the \"Selling Expenses\" specifically as per the problem structure since it's more directly linked to customer orders, but we will note the major impact from COGS as well.\n\nThus, we will include \"Selling Expenses\" value in the solution.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '630420.28'}}\n```",
