Hereâ€™s how I will break it down:\n\n1. **Costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods/services to customers**: This line item typically refers to the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS), which in this case is provided as 5580000.00.\n\n2. **Financing costs incurred to raise funds needed for production and operation**: This is captured under \"Financial Expenses\" which is listed as 748774.91.\n\n3. **Systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life**: This is indicated by the line item \"Depreciation\", which in this income statement is given as 45742.50.\n\n4. **Total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period**: This is shown as \"Tax Expense\", which amounts to 346025.72.\n\nNow, I'll compile these extracted values in original order as required:\n\n- **value1**: Cost of Goods Sold = '5580000.00'\n- **value2**: Depreciation = '45742.50'\n- **value3**: Financial Expenses = '748774.91'\n- **value4**: Tax Expense = '346025.72'\n\nNow, I will format these values within the requested JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '5580000.00', 'value2': '45742.50', 'value3': '748774.91', 'value4': '346025.72'}}\n```",
