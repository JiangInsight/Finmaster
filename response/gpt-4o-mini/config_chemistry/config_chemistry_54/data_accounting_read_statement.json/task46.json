We will focus on the section labeled \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities,\" as this typically includes the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets.\n\n2. **Extracting Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - From the provided statement, we find:\n     - Cash Flow from Investing Activities shows:\n       - Purchase of Fixed Assets: **1446972.73** (This is cash outflow for acquisition of assets)\n       - Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities: **-1446972.73** (This is the net amount resulting from the investing activities)\n\n3. **Decomposing into Sub-items**:\n   - The only major line item in \"Cash Flow from Investing Activities\" is \"Purchase of Fixed Assets,\" which is the component sub-item we can identify:\n     - Sub-item: Purchase of Fixed Assets = **1446972.73**\n\n4. **Output Formatting**:\n   - The extracted value for the net amount is the net cash flow from investing activities, which is negative as it indicates cash outflow.\n   - The sub-item value is the amount spent in acquiring fixed assets.\n\nSo, we can format the answer into the required JSON structure. \n\nHere's the final solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1446972.73', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '1446972.73'}}}\n```",
