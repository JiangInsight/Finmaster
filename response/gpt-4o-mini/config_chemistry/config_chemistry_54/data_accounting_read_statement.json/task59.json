However, for this task, we are focusing on the accrual aspect, so we refer to the amount from the Balance Sheet.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the net addition in cash and cash equivalents\nFrom the financial statements:\n\n1. **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The line item for the net increase in cash and cash equivalents during the period is labeled as **Net Increase**, which shows an amount of **-7161080.18**.\n\n### Step 3: Group extracted values by financial statement\nNow we will group the values according to the order specified:\n\n- **Balance Sheet**: \n  - Interest Receivable: **2566.71**\n  \n- **Income Statement**: \n  - (Not applicable for interest calculation in this context)\n  \n- **Cash Flow Statement**: \n  - Net Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents: **-7161080.18**\n\n### Final Output\nThe extracted values are:\n- For interest accrued but not yet received: **2566.71**\n- For net increase in cash and cash equivalents: **-7161080.18**\n\nI will now format the result in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2566.71', 'value2': '-7161080.18'} }\n```",
