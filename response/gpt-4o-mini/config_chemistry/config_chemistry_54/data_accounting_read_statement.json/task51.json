The income statement confirms this since it recognizes the same amount as interest income.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the Solution\nThe requirements state that we need to present the initial and final values of interest accrued but not yet received.\n\nThus, the extracted values are:\n- **Initial Value**: '0.00'\n- **End Value**: '2566.71'\n\n### Final JSON Output\nAs the values have been identified, we format them according to the required JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2566.71'}}\n```",
