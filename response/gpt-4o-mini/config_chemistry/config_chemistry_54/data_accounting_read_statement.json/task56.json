The relevant information regarding depreciation appears in both the cash flow statement and the income statement.\n\n1. **Identify Depreciation in the Financial Statements:**\n   - From the **cash flow statement**, we see:\n     - Depreciation: 45742.50\n   - From the **income statement**, we also see:\n     - Depreciation: 45742.50\n\nBoth statements show the same value for depreciation.\n\n2. **Understanding Depreciation:**\n   - Depreciation is the method of systematically allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. Here, the constant showing of 45742.50 indicates the annual depreciation expense being recognized.\n\n3. **Extracting the Value:**\n   Since both sources confirm the depreciation value of the asset is 45742.50, this value is our target for the solution.\n\nIn conclusion, the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of the asset over its useful life is confirmed as 45742.50.\n\nThus, the answer in the required format is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45742.50'} }\n```",
