This line item is often referred to as \"Net Profit.\"\n\n1. **Review the Provided Problem**: \n   We need to locate the line item for \"Net Profit\" in the provided cash flow statement details.\n\n2. **Identify the Line Item**:\n   From the provided statement:\n   - `Net Profit`  | `-1669849.77` | `2024-01-31`\n   \n   This line represents the net profit value, which is the amount retained after deducting all relevant expenses.\n\n3. **Read the Value**:\n   The value associated with \"Net Profit\" is `-1669849.77`. This indicates a loss, as it is a negative value.\n\n4. **Present the answer in JSON format**:\n   We will structure our solution according to the format specified in the instruction.\n\nThus, the final answer is structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1669849.77'} }\n```",
