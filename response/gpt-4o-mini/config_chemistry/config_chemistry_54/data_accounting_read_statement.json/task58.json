                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to extract the value of \"cash and cash equivalents\" at the beginning of the period from the provided financial statements. \n\nHere's the approach we'll take, broken down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Financial Statements**: We have three financial statements: balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement. We are particularly interested in the balance sheet and cash flow statements for cash and cash equivalents.\n\n2. **Locate Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Cash and cash equivalents typically include:\n   - Cash on Hand\n   - Bank Deposits \n\n3. **Look for Starting Balances**: These amounts are presented in the \"Initial_amount\" column of the balance sheet. The corresponding date for the beginning period is \"2023-12-31\".\n\n4. **Summing the Values**: From the balance sheet, we will sum the values of 'Cash on Hand' and 'Bank Deposits' to get the total cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period.\n\n5. **Calculation**:\n   - Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n   - Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00\n   - Total Cash and Cash Equivalents = Cash on Hand + Bank Deposits = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 = 8,000,000.00\n\nNow, we summarize this in the required JSON format to represent the solution.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
