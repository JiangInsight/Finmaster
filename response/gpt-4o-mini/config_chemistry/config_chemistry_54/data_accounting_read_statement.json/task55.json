The line item \"Tax Expense\" directly indicates the amount of tax that the company owes for the reporting period. \n\nFrom the income statement provided:\n- **Tax Expense:** 346025.72 \n\n2. **Balance Sheet:** The balance sheet also contains a line item titled \"Taxes Payable\", which reflects the amount of tax that remains unpaid by the end of the reporting period. \n\nFrom the balance sheet provided:\n- **Taxes Payable:** 346025.72 \n\nThe values from both the income statement and the balance sheet match, confirming that the entity is expected to pay a total of 346025.72 in taxes during the reporting period.\n\nThus, we deduce that the total tax amount is 346025.72.\n\nFinal result in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '346025.72'} }\n```",
