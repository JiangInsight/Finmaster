In financial terms, this typically relates to \"Accounts Payable\" and any relevant tax liabilities like \"Taxes Payable.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n1. **Examine Balance Sheet:**\n   - In the balance sheet, we notice the item \"Accounts Payable\" which stands at **2390000.00** for the end date of **2024-01-31**.\n   - Additionally, we see \"Taxes Payable\" at **346025.72** for the same end date.\n\n2. **Determine the Additions:**\n   - The increase in \"Accounts Payable\" indicates that the entity has incurred additional obligations to pay suppliers or creditors, which is a direct representation of credit purchases.\n   - Similarly, an increase in \"Taxes Payable\" implies that the entity has incurred additional tax liabilities.\n\n3. **Sum the Relevant Items:**\n   - Accounts Payable: **2390000.00**\n   - Taxes Payable: **346025.72**\n   \n   Since both represent amounts owed, we can add them together:\n   - Total Credit Purchases: **2390000.00 + 346025.72 = 2736025.72**\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Line Items:**\n   The relevant data extracted here focuses solely on the total from \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable\".\n\nBased on these calculations and line items, we can conclude that the amount owed for goods and services received on credit, drawn from the accounts payable and tax payable entries, amounts to **2736025.72**.\n\n### Final Answer\nWe can now format this solution into the designated JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2736025.72'} }\n```",
