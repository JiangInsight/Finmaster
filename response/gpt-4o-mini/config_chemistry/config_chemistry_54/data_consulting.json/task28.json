                        "content": "To solve the financial statement analysis for the Debt to Asset Ratio, Gross Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow Ratio, we will calculate each ratio step-by-step based on the provided financial statements.\n\n1. **Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   - This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n     \\]\n   - From the balance sheet:\n     - Total Assets = 14,066,175.95\n     - Total Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n     - Other liabilities can be inferred by noting total assets and total equity:\n       \\[\n       \\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Assets} - \\text{Total Owner's Equity} = 14,066,175.95 - 11,330,150.23 = 2,736,025.72\n       \\]\n   - Therefore, Total Liabilities = 2,736,025.72.\n   - Now plug in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{2,736,025.72}{14,066,175.95} \\approx 0.194\n     \\]\n\n2. **Gross Profit Margin**:\n   - This indicates how much profit a company makes after accounting for the costs associated with making and selling its products. It is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - From the income statement:\n     - Gross Profit = 1,340,513.79\n     - Total Revenue = 6,920,513.79\n   - Now plug in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left(\\frac{1,340,513.79}{6,920,513.79}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 19.38\\%\n     \\]\n\n3. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**:\n   - This ratio measures how well current liabilities are covered by the cash flow generated from a company's operations. It is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - From the cash flow statement:\n     - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -5,714,107.45\n   - From the balance sheet:\n     - Total Current Liabilities = 2,736,025.72\n   - Now plug in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-5,714,107.45}{2,736,025.72} \\approx -2.09\n     \\]\n\nFinally, we round and format these results appropriately for the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.19', 'Gross Profit Margin': '19.38%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-2.09'}}\n```",
