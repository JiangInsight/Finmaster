                        "content": "To calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio, we need to first determine the cash flow from operating activities and the total debt. The Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}} \\]\n\n### Step 1: Identify Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\nFrom the cash flow statement provided, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: **-5,714,107.45**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Liabilities\nFrom the balance sheet provided, we need to determine the total liabilities. The total liabilities consist of total current liabilities and any non-current liabilities (if present).\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Total Current Liabilities: **2,736,025.72**\n  \nSince there are no non-current liabilities mentioned in the problem, we can consider total liabilities to be:\n  \n\\[ \\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Current Liabilities} = 2,736,025.72 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\nNow we substitute the values into the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-5,714,107.45}{2,736,025.72}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculation\nCalculating the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = -2.09 \\, \\text{(approximately)}\n\\]\n\n### Final Output\nNow we can present this result in the required JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-2.09'} }\n```",
