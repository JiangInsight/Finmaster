The unit price is also different from being recorded for 'Sales' instead of 'Purchases'.\n   - **Inconsistencies in Unit Prices and Total Amounts:** The `recorded_unit_price` and `recorded_amount` for various Sales entries must be verified to ensure they align with expected values using unit price times quantity without discrepancy.\n\n3. **Conclusions from Findings:**\n   - For **Purchase20231231004**:\n     - Original category: 'Purchase'\n     - Recorded category: 'Sale'\n     - Original amount: '300000.0', based on their recorded quantity and unit price.\n     - Recorded amount: '323485.16'\n     - Original price: '10000.0' (not accurately reflected)\n     - Recorded price: '10088.38' (not accurate)\n   \nThus, the inconsistencies have been identified, and their attributes laid out for the transaction \"Purchase20231231004\".\n\nHereâ€™s my formatted answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Purchase', 'Recorded category': 'Sale', 'Original date': None, 'Recorded date': None, 'Original payment/receipt_status': None, 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': None, 'Original payment_method': None, 'Recorded payment_method': None, 'Original quantity': '30.0', 'Recorded quantity': 'None', 'Original price': '10000.0', 'Recorded price': '10088.38', 'Original receive_method': None, 'Recorded receive_method': None, 'Original amount': '300000.0', 'Recorded amount': '323485.16', 'Original tax': None, 'Recorded tax': None, 'Original profit': None, 'Recorded profit': None, 'Original Preparer': None, 'Recorded Preparer': None, 'Original Approver': None, 'Recorded Approver': None, 'id': 'Purchase20231231004'}}\n```",
