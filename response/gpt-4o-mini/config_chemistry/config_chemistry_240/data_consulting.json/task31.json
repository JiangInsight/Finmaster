                        "content": "To calculate the required financial ratios based on the provided financial statements, we will follow a step-by-step reasoning for each calculation:\n\n### 1. Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio indicates how well a company manages its accounts receivable. It's calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\n#### Calculation:\n- **Net Credit Sales** = Total Revenue = $8,361,807.77\n- **Accounts Receivable (End Amount)** = $2,498,141.24\n- **Average Accounts Receivable** = End Amount (since we don't have Initial Amount provided for sales):\n\nLet's assume the beginning balance is zero, therefore:\n- **Average Accounts Receivable** = \\(\\frac{0 + 2,498,141.24}{2} = 1,249,070.62\\)\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{8,361,807.77}{1,249,070.62} \\approx 6.69\n\\]\n\n### 2. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\nThis ratio shows the ability to pay current liabilities with cash generated from operating activities. It's calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\n#### Calculation:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities** = -$4,900,875.61\n- **Total Current Liabilities** = $3,428,090.41 (End Amount)\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-4,900,875.61}{3,428,090.41} \\approx -1.43\n\\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio\nThis is essentially the same as the Operating Cash Flow Ratio, expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = -1.43\n\\]\n\n### 4. Total Asset Turnover Ratio\nThis ratio measures the efficiency of a company's use of its assets in generating sales revenue. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\n#### Calculation:\n- **Total Revenue** = $8,361,807.77\n- **Total Assets (End Amount)** = $15,086,049.65\n- **Average Total Assets** = \\(\\frac{Total Assets (Start) + Total Assets (End)}{2}\\)\n  - Start Total Assets = $13,000,000 (Initial Amount)\n  - Average Total Assets = \\(\\frac{13,000,000 + 15,086,049.65}{2} = 14,043,024.83\\)\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{8,361,807.77}{14,043,024.83} \\approx 0.60\n\\]\n\n### 5. Debt to Equity Ratio\nThis ratio evaluates a company's financial leverage by comparing total liabilities to total equity. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Equity}}\n\\]\n\n#### Calculation:\n- **Total Liabilities (End)** = $15,086,049.65 - $11,657,959.24 = $3,428,090.41\n- **Total Owner's Equity (End)** = $11,657,959.24\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{3,428,090.41}{11,657,959.24} \\approx 0.29\n\\]\n\n### Summary of Calculated Ratios:\nNow we will present these ratios in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '6.69', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-1.43', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-1.43', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.60', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.29'} }\n```",
