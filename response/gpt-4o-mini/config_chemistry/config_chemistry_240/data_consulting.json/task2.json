                        "content": "To calculate the Quick Ratio, we first need to determine the necessary components based on the provided balance sheet:\n\n1. **Definition of Quick Ratio**: The Quick Ratio is a measure of a company's short-term liquidity and is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Liquid Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n   - Liquid assets are typically defined as current assets that can quickly be converted to cash without significant loss. This typically includes cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable, but excludes inventory.\n\n2. **Identifying Liquid Assets from the Balance Sheet**:\n   - Cash on Hand: 1,379,124.39\n   - Bank Deposits: 126,796.33\n   - Accounts Receivable: 2,498,141.24\n   - Interest Receivable: 4,535.06 (this is typically considered as a liquid asset)\n   - Inventory is not included, as it's not a liquid asset.\n\n3. **Calculating Total Liquid Assets**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Liquid Assets} = \\text{Cash on Hand} + \\text{Bank Deposits} + \\text{Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Interest Receivable} \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Liquid Assets} = 1,379,124.39 + 126,796.33 + 2,498,141.24 + 4,535.06 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Liquid Assets} = 4,008,597.02\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identifying Current Liabilities**:\n   - Accounts Payable: 3,010,000.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 418,090.41\n   - Total Current Liabilities: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Current Liabilities} = 3,010,000.00 + 418,090.41 = 3,428,090.41\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating the Quick Ratio**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liquid Assets}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{4,008,597.02}{3,428,090.41} \\approx 1.17\n   \\]\n\n6. **Presenting the Final Answer**:\n   We round the Quick Ratio to two decimal places.\n\nNow we can format this calculation into the required JSON format:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Quick Ratio': '1.17'}}\n```",
