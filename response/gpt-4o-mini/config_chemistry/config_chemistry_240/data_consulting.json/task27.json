                        "content": "To solve this task, we will compute the three financial ratios step-by-step: \n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**  \n   This ratio measures the ability of the company to convert its net income into cash from operating activities. It is calculated as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Profit}}\n   \\]\n\n   - From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is **-4900875.61**.\n   - From the income statement, the Net Profit is **-1342040.76**.\n\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-4900875.61}{-1342040.76} \\approx 3.65\n   \\]\n\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**  \n   This ratio indicates how efficiently a company utilizes its current assets to generate revenue. It is computed as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Current Assets}}\n   \\]\n\n   - Total Revenue from the income statement is **8361807.77**.\n\n   To find Average Total Current Assets, we can use the end balance from the balance sheet:\n   - Total Current Assets at the end of the period is **8538597.02**.\n\n   For the average total current assets, we assume that there were no changes to the current assets apart from the final balance (noting that the initial balance was not used to calculate averages in such a short timeframe):\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Total Current Assets} = \\frac{8000000.00 + 8538597.02}{2} \\approx 8269298.51\n   \\]\n\n   Now calculate the ratio:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{8361807.77}{8269298.51} \\approx 1.01\n   \\]\n\n\n3. **Quick Ratio**  \n   This ratio measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets. The formula is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} + \\text{Accounts Receivable} + \\text{Interest Receivable}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n   - Cash and Cash Equivalents (End Total) is **1505920.72**. \n   - Accounts Receivable is **2498141.24**.\n   - Interest Receivable is **4535.06**.\n   - Total Current Liabilities is **3428090.41**.\n\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{1505920.72 + 2498141.24 + 4535.06}{3428090.41} \\approx \\frac{4004587.02}{3428090.41} \\approx 1.17\n   \\]\n\nNow we will put these computed ratios into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.65', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '1.01', 'Quick Ratio': '1.17'}}\n```",
