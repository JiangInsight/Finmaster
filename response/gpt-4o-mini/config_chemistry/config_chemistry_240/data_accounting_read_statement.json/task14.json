The relevant items for current liabilities include:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**\n2. **Taxes Payable**\n3. **Total Current Liabilities**\n\nLet's extract the values from the provided balance sheet:\n\n- **Accounts Payable**: \n  - Initial Amount: 0.00\n  - End Amount: 3,010,000.00\n\n- **Taxes Payable**: \n  - Initial Amount: 0.00\n  - End Amount: 418,090.41\n\n- **Total Current Liabilities**: \n  - Initial Amount: 0.00\n  - End Amount: 3,428,090.41\n\nNow, we will analyze the values:\n\n- The **initial value** of total current liabilities is 0.00.\n- The **end value** of total current liabilities is 3,428,090.41.\n\nWe can confirm that the total amount of liabilities expected to be settled in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle is represented by the end value of the Total Current Liabilities.\n\nNow we format the final answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3428090.41'} }\n```",
