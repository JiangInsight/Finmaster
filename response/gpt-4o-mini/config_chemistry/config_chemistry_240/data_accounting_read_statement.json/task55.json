The relevant line items are clear, and the value is identical in both cases.\n   \nHence, the total amount of tax expected to be paid or recovered during the reporting period is 418090.41.\n\nNow, formatting the response in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '418090.41'} }\n```",
