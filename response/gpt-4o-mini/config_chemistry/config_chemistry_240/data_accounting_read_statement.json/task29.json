In this income statement, \"Total Revenue\" is listed as **8361807.77**. \n\n2. **Constituent Line Items**: The main component of total revenue is typically the \"Main Business Revenue\". Here, it amounts to **8361807.77**, which matches the \"Total Revenue\".\n\n3. **Sub-Items**: We need to refer to the original item components to generate the expected sub-items. Since we are looking for one component sub-item that originates from the input statement, we can take \"Main Business Revenue\" as the one and only sub-item under total income.\n\n4. **Initial and Final Values**: \n   - The initial value of \"Main Business Revenue\" is also **8361807.77**.\n   - The final value for the sub-item remains the same since we are considering it to be the same as the total income.\n\nNow, we put this information together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8361807.77', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '8361807.77'}}\n```",
