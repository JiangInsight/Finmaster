The amount of interest accrued but not yet received, found in the Income Statement as \"Interest Income\" or on the Balance Sheet as \"Interest Receivable\".\n2. The net addition in the amount of cash and cash equivalents during the period, found in the Cash Flow Statement as \"Net Increase\".\n\nWe will go through each of the financial statements to find these values.\n\n### 1. Balance Sheet\n\nIn the Balance Sheet, we find the line item for interest accrued but not yet received under the account named `Interest Receivable`:\n\n```\n| Interest Receivable | 0.00 | 2023-12-31 | 4535.06 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\n\nThe end value is **4535.06**.\n\n### 2. Income Statement\n\nIn the Income Statement, we find the line item for interest accrued but not yet received, also as part of interest income:\n\n```\n| Interest Income | 4535.06 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\n\nIt's the same value: **4535.06**.\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\n\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, we look for the net addition in cash and cash equivalents, which is provided under the line item `Net Increase`:\n\n```\n| Net Increase | -6494079.28 | 2024-01-28 |\n```\n\nThe value is **-6494079.28**.\n\nNow we have gathered the necessary values:\n\n- Interest accrued but not yet received: **4535.06**\n- Net increase in cash and cash equivalents: **-6494079.28**\n\nNow, we will present these values in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '4535.06', 'value2': '-6494079.28'} }\n```",
