In this case, it is amounting to **8361807.77**.\n  \n- **Total Revenue**: This value is typically the same as Main Business Revenue when there are no other sources of income included, which in this case is also **8361807.77**. However, this is considered redundant since we can derive this from Main Business Revenue.\n\nFor the purposes of extracting the value of core operating activities, we will focus on Main Business Revenue. The rest of the items such as Cost of Goods Sold, Expenses, and others are related to costs and other non-core operating activities.\n\nTherefore, the value extracted from main business revenue is **8361807.77**.\n\nNow, we present this value in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8361807.77'} }\n```",
