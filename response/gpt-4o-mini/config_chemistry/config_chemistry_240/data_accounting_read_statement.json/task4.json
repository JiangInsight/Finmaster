In this balance sheet, the account titled \"Interest Receivable\" serves this purpose.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and End Values**:\n   - **Initial Amount** for \"Interest Receivable\" on 2023-12-31 is **0.00**.\n   - **End Amount** for \"Interest Receivable\" on 2024-01-28 is **4535.06**.\n\n3. **Formulate the Output**: We will structure the output in the specified JSON format.\n\nCombining all these steps, the solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '4535.06'} }\n```",
