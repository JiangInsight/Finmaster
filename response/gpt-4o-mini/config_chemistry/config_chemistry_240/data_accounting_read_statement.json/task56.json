In this specific balance sheet, the `Accumulated Depreciation` is shown as `45751.04` as of `2024-01-28`. \n\n2. **Analyze the Cash Flow Statement**:\n   - The Cash Flow statement shows a separate item for `Depreciation`, also listed as `45751.04` for the date `2024-01-28`. This confirms the amount of depreciation for the relevant period.\n\n3. **Analyze the Income Statement**:\n   - Similarly, the Income Statement lists `Depreciation` as `45751.04`, again for the date `2024-01-28`. This further reaffirms the consistent reporting of depreciation across the financial statements.\n\nSince the amount of depreciation and the corresponding systematic allocation appears consistently across these statements, it indicates that `45751.04` is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount for the period covered.\n\nNow, we will present this information in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45751.04'} }\n```",
