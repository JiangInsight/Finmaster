Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Net Profit**: \n   From the income statement, the net profit is clearly labeled:\n   - **Net Profit**: -1342040.76\n\n2. **Extract Sub-Items**: \n   The calculation of net profit can be broken down into several key components:\n   - **Total Revenue**: This is the revenue before any costs or expenses: \n     - Value: 8361807.77 \n     \n   - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold: \n     - Value: 6720000.00 \n\n   - **Total Expenses**: This is the sum of all operating costs including administrative, selling, depreciation, and financial expenses:\n     - Value: 2570293.18 \n\n   - **Interest Income**: This is the income earned from interest, which can offset the expenses: \n     - Value: 4535.06 \n\n   - **Tax Expense**: This stands for the taxes deducted from the profit before tax:\n     - Value: 418090.41 \n\n3. **Collate the Values**: \n   - Summarizing the sub-items and their initial values:\n     - Total Revenue: 8361807.77\n     - COGS: 6720000.00\n     - Total Expenses: 2570293.18\n     - Interest Income: 4535.06\n     - Tax Expense: 418090.41\n\nNow, I will present the final solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1342040.76', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '8361807.77', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '6720000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value3': '2570293.18', 'sub_items_sub_item value4': '4535.06', 'sub_items_sub_item value5': '418090.41'}}\n```",
