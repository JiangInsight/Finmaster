This expense is directly related to securing customer orders as it reflects the cost of producing or acquiring the goods that generate revenue.\n   - **Selling Expenses**: These expenses encompass costs related to selling and marketing the products, which can also be considered in securing customer orders, although less directly than COGS.\n\n3. **Review Their Values**:\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold**: 6720000.00\n   - **Selling Expenses**: 404114.07\n\n4. **Determine Focus**: \n   - The COGS value is the primary metric we are interested in when accounting for costs incurred to deliver goods and services to customers. \n   - While Selling Expenses could also be considered, they primarily focus on indirect costs related to sales processes rather than the direct cost of delivering goods.\n\nThus, the relevant value extracted from the line item is from **Cost of Goods Sold**, which reflects the total cost incurred for delivering the goods to customers.\n\nTherefore, the solution based on the identification of the line item and its value is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6720000.00'} }\n```",
