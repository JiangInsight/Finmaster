However, since the data provided is primarily about assets, liabilities, and equity, we are primarily interested in \"Accumulated Depreciation,\" which can indicate depreciation expense, along with other relevant entries that may arise in the income statement.\n\n1. **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n   - **Initial Amount**: 0.00 (as of 2023-12-31)\n   - **End Amount**: 45751.04 (as of 2024-01-28)\n\nTherefore, the only relevant expense line item identified in this balance sheet is Accumulated Depreciation, which represents the accumulated amount of depreciation expense over the specified period.\n\nNow, we can summarize this in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45751.04'} }\n```",
