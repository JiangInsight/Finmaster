The key aspect we are looking for is the financing costs, which are typically included under labels like \"Financial Expenses\" or \"Interest Expenses.\"\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Line Items**:\n   - The line item \"**Financial Expenses**\" is present in the income statement, which is directly related to the costs of financing.\n   - There are no other line items listed that indicate financing costs (like \"Interest Expenses\").\n\n3. **Extracting the Financing Costs**:\n   - The value associated with \"**Financial Expenses**\" is **523376.99**.\n\n4. **Presenting the Solution in Required Format**:\n   We will now format the solution according to the specified JSON format.\n\nHere is the final output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '523376.99'} }\n```",
