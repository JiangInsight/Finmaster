The line item of interest is:\n\n- **(Increase) Decrease in Accounts Receivable**\n\nThis line can show a decrease in the amounts owed to the entity, which is relevant to our task.\n\nBy examining the data under this line item:\n\n- The value is `-2498141.24`.\n\nThe negative sign indicates a decrease in accounts receivable, implying that amounts owed to the entity have decreased.\n\nNow, we can present the extracted value in the required JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-2498141.24'} }\n```",
