We're provided with an income statement that lists various financial accounts and their respective amounts.\n2. We look for the line item that explicitly mentions \"Tax Expense,\" as this is the standard nomenclature for such an entry in an income statement.\n3. In the provided data:\n\n```\n| Profit Before Tax | -923950.35 | 2024-01-28 |\n| Tax Expense       | 418090.41  | 2024-01-28 |\n| Net Profit        | -1342040.76| 2024-01-28 |\n```\n\n4. We find \"Tax Expense\" listed with a value of \"418090.41.\"\n5. This value represents the total amount of tax the entity is expected to pay or recover during the reporting period.\n\nThus, the extracted value for tax expense is `418090.41`.\n\nFollowing the required JSON format for the answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '418090.41'} }\n```",
