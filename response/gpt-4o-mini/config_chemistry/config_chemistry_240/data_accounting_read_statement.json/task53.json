This value is generally represented by the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS) entry in the income statement.\n\nLet's review the financial statements provided:\n\n1. **Income Statement**:\n   The relevant line item is:\n   - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): **6720000.00**\n\nThis value represents the cost associated with the inventory that was sold during the reporting period.\n\n2. **Balance Sheet** and **Cash Flow Statement**:\n   While these statements show changes in inventory and cash flow activities, the COGS from the income statement directly provides the answer to our specific question about the carrying amount of inventories sold.\n\nHence, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 6720000.00.\n\nNow, let's format our answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6720000.00'} }\n```",
