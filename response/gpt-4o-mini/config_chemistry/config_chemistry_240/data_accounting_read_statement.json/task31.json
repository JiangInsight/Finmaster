The relevant item we are focusing on is the \"Profit Before Tax,\" which is given as **-923950.35**.\n\n2. Next, we decompose this value into four component sub-items, all of which must come from the input statement. Here are the components found in the statement:\n   - **Total Revenue**: This is the total sales amount for the period. From the statement: **8361807.77**.\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold**: This is the total cost directly associated with producing the goods sold. From the statement: **6720000.00**.\n   - **Total Expenses**: This includes all operating expenses incurred excluding taxes. From the statement: **2570293.18**.\n   - **Interest Income**: This is the income derived from investments or bank deposits. From the statement: **4535.06**.\n\n3. We will output:\n   - The \"value\" of profit before tax: **-923950.35**.\n   - The four sub-item values:\n     - Total Revenue: **8361807.77**.\n     - Cost of Goods Sold: **6720000.00**.\n     - Total Expenses: **2570293.18**.\n     - Interest Income: **4535.06**.\n\nBased on the data, the final JSON representation is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-923950.35', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '8361807.77', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '6720000.00', 'sub_items_sub_item value3': '2570293.18', 'sub_items_sub_item value4': '4535.06'} }\n```",
