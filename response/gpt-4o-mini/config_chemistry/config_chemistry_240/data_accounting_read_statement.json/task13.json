Such items typically include \"Fixed Assets\" and \"Accumulated Depreciation.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Accounts**:\n   - From the balance sheet provided:\n     - **Fixed Assets**: Include long-term tangible or intangible assets that are not expected to be converted into cash within the company's operating cycle.\n     - **Accumulated Depreciation**: Represents the cumulative depreciation expense allocated against fixed assets. While it is not an asset itself, it reduces the overall amount of fixed assets.\n\n2. **Extract Initial and Final Values**:\n   - **Fixed Assets**:\n     - Initial Amount: 5000000.00\n     - End Amount: 6593203.67\n   - **Accumulated Depreciation**:\n     - Initial Amount: 0.00 (Note: This will usually remain at 0.00 as it only reflects deductions)\n     - End Amount: 45751.04 (For the purpose of total fixed assets, we do not consider this as a positive asset amount, but we mention it here for completeness: it is deducted from Fixed Assets.)\n     \n3. **Total Non-current Assets**: \n   - The total value when considering net fixed assets would be:\n     - **Net Fixed Assets Calculation**: Fixed Assets (End Amount) â€“ Accumulated Depreciation (End Amount)\n     - This is not specifically needed as we're required to extract just the fixed assets.\n\n4. **Final Output Formatting**:\n   - Since we are only required to report on Fixed Assets:\n   - Initial Value = 5000000.00 (for Fixed Assets)\n   - End Value = 6593203.67 (for Fixed Assets)\n\nLet's compile our findings in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '6593203.67'}}\n```",
