This represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Line Items**:\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold**: This is typically the main cost incurred in delivering goods to customers. In the provided data, the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed as 6720000.00, which aligns with what we're looking for.\n\n3. **Extracting the Value**: \n   - Since we're focused on costs directly related to securing orders and delivering products, COGS (6720000.00) directly represents these expenses.\n\n4. **Other related expenses**:\n   - We also see \"Selling Expenses\", which may include costs tied to acquiring customers and selling goods. However, typically for this analysis, COGS would be the primary focus.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: \n   - The relevant value identified is from \"Cost of Goods Sold\", which is our primary answer source.\n\nThus, consolidating all this information, the solution can be formatted as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6720000.00'} }\n```",
