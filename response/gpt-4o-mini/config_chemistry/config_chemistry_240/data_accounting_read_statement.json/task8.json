The relevant accounts indicating such obligations include \"Accounts Payable\" and \"Taxes Payable.\"\n\nLet's analyze the provided balance sheet data step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Accounts**:\n   - The key accounts that represent amounts owed by the entity:\n     - **Accounts Payable**\n     - **Taxes Payable**\n\n2. **Extract Initial and Final Values**:\n   - **Accounts Payable**:\n     - Initial Amount: 0.00\n     - End Amount: 3010000.00\n   - **Taxes Payable**:\n     - Initial Amount: 0.00\n     - End Amount: 418090.41\n\n3. **Calculate Total Ending Liabilities**:\n   - For our solution, we only need the end amounts to provide the specific values for what is owed for goods or services at the end date.\n\n4. **Final Results**:\n   - Initial value (for both Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable combined): 0.00\n   - End value (total of Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable): \n     - Accounts Payable: 3010000.00\n     - Taxes Payable: 418090.41\n     - Total End Value = 3010000.00 + 418090.41 = 3428090.41\n\nNow, we will present the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3428090.41'} }\n```",
