Hence, nothing to extract here.\n\n3. **Fixed Assets** (Cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets):\n   - This value reflects Fixed Assets, but we should particularly look for acquisitions in the cash flow statement.\n\n### Income Statement\n\n4. **Financial Expenses** (Financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation):\n   - Amount: **523376.99**\n   \n### Cash Flow Statement\n\n5. **Purchase of Fixed Assets** (Cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets):\n   - Amount: **1593203.67**\n\nNow, let's summarize the extracted values according to the required output format.\n\n- From the **Balance Sheet**: \n  - Accounts Receivable: **2498141.24**\n  \n- From the **Income Statement**: \n  - Financial Expenses: **523376.99**\n\n- From the **Cash Flow Statement**: \n  - Purchase of Fixed Assets: **1593203.67**\n\nFinally, we can structure the answer in the specified JSON format as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '2498141.24', 'value2': '523376.99', 'value3': '1593203.67'}}\n```",
