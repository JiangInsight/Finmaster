The acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents.\n2. The relevant activities include the purchase of fixed assets and potentially other line items denoting investment cash flows.\n\nLet's examine the provided cash flow statement:\n\n- **Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n  - **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: 1593203.67 (This will be included as a cash outflow)\n\nNow, to calculate the net cash flow from investing activities, we see the net cash flow from this section is listed as **-1593203.67**.\n\nAccording to the task instruction, we will also decompose this into sub-items. Here, we have one relevant sub-item:\n\n- **sub_item**: Purchase of Fixed Assets = 1593203.67 (as it shows the cash outflow)\n\nTo conclude:\n\n- The total net amount of cash and cash equivalents generated from the activities of acquiring and disposing of long-term assets, along with related investments (our single relevant item), is **-1593203.67**. \n- Our sub-item is the amount spent on fixed assets, which is **1593203.67**.\n\nNow, let's format the solution using the specified JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1593203.67', 'sub_items': {'sub_item value': '1593203.67'}} }\n```",
