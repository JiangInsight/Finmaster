The key line item that reflects the cost associated with the products sold is known as \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\nFrom the provided information:\n- The line item \"Cost of Goods Sold\" is listed as `6720000.00`.\n\nSince COGS directly relates to the carrying value of inventories sold, we can conclude that the value of inventories sold during the reporting period is equal to this amount.\n\nNow, I will format the answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6720000.00'} }\n```",
