The relevant line items to find are:\n\n1. **Net Profit**: This indicates the profit retained after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization have been deducted from total revenue.\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**: This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment, and other long-term assets.\n\nNow, let's look at the provided cash flow statement:\n\n1. **Net Profit**: \n   - From the cash flow statement:\n   ```\n   | Net Profit  | -1342040.76 | 2024-01-28 |\n   ```\n   The value for Net Profit is **-1342040.76**.\n\n2. **Purchase of Fixed Assets**:\n   - From the cash flow statement:\n   ```\n   | Purchase of Fixed Assets  | 1593203.67 | 2024-01-28 |\n   ```\n   The value for Purchase of Fixed Assets is **1593203.67**.\n\nNext, we fit these extracted values into the required JSON format as specified.\n\nHereâ€™s the final output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-1342040.76', 'value2': '1593203.67'}}\n```",
