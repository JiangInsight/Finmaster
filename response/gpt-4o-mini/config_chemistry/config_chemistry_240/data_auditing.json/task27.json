The original amount was **1250000.0**.\n\nThus, for **Purchase20231231010**:\n- Original category: 'Purchase'\n- Recorded category: 'Administrative Expenses'\n- Original date: (not relevant)\n- Recorded date: (not relevant)\n- Original payment/receipt_status: (also not relevant)\n- Recorded payment/receipt_status: (Unpaid)\n- Original payment_method: (not relevant)\n- Recorded payment_method: (not mentioned)\n- Original quantity: 25.0\n- Recorded quantity: 25.0\n- Original price: 50000.0 (but mismatch with description)\n- Recorded price: 47176.59\n- Original amount: 1250000.0\n- Recorded amount: 1331256.33\n- Original tax: (not relevant)\n- Recorded tax: (not relevant)\n- Original profit:  (not relevant)\n- Recorded profit: (not relevant)\n- Original Preparer: (not relevant)\n- Recorded Preparer: (not relevant)\n- Original Approver: (not relevant)\n- Recorded Approver: (not relevant)\n- ID: Purchase20231231010\n\nHence the response can be generated in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Original category': 'Purchase', 'Recorded category': 'Administrative Expenses', 'Original date': '2023-12-31', 'Recorded date': '2023-12-31', 'Original payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Recorded payment/receipt_status': 'Unpaid', 'Original payment_method': 'Account Payable', 'Recorded payment_method': 'Cash', 'Original quantity': '25.0', 'Recorded quantity': '25.0', 'Original price': '50000.0', 'Recorded price': '47176.59', 'Original receive_method': 'Account Payable', 'Recorded receive_method': null, 'Original amount': '1250000.0', 'Recorded amount': '1331256.33', 'Original tax': null, 'Recorded tax': null, 'Original profit': null, 'Recorded profit': null, 'Original Preparer': null, 'Recorded Preparer': null, 'Original Approver': null, 'Recorded Approver': null, 'id': 'Purchase20231231010'} }\n```",
