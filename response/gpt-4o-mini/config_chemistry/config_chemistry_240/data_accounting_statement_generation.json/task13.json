                        "content": "To calculate the taxes payable at the start and end of the period based on the provided transaction data, we need to identify transactions that impact the taxes payable account. Generally, taxes arise from sales transactions and are deducted from received payments. For this example, we will focus on the **tax_amount** field for sales to determine the taxes payable.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Initial Taxes Payable\n\nFrom the initialization transaction list, we will observe the entries that don't have any sales leading to tax amounts. Thus, we start with an initial value of:\n\n- **Taxes Payable Initial Value**: 0.00 \n\n### Step 2: Calculate Final Taxes Payable\n\nNext, we will sum all the **tax_amount** values from the transaction list, which represent the taxes accrued from sales. Here are the sales entries with taxable amounts:\n\n1. Sale20240102003 -> tax_amount: **11248.06**\n2. Sale20240103005 -> tax_amount: **2897.86**\n3. Sale20240103006 -> tax_amount: **6152.17**\n4. Sale20240104007 -> tax_amount: **16231.44**\n5. Sale20240104008 -> tax_amount: **1786.54**\n6. Sale20240109019 -> tax_amount: **10376.60**\n7. Sale20240109020 -> tax_amount: **3779.07**\n8. Sale20240111024 -> tax_amount: **11337.25**\n9. Sale20240111025 -> tax_amount: **33066.13**\n10. Sale20240112027 -> tax_amount: **575.25**\n11. Sale20240112028 -> tax_amount: **5621.11**\n12. Sale20240113029 -> tax_amount: **2224.61**\n13. Sale20240114031 -> tax_amount: **8728.06**\n14. Sale20240115032 -> tax_amount: **13918.78**\n15. Sale20240115033 -> tax_amount: **2644.84**\n16. Sale20240116034 -> tax_amount: **2858.33**\n17. Sale20240117036 -> tax_amount: **3177.12**\n18. Sale20240118038 -> tax_amount: **2671.84**\n19. Sale20240118039 -> tax_amount: **6219.33**\n20. Sale20240119042 -> tax_amount: **5641.87**\n21. Sale20240119043 -> tax_amount: **24702.68**\n22. Sale20240120044 -> tax_amount: **13636.62**\n23. Sale20240121045 -> tax_amount: **5575.52**\n24. Sale20240121046 -> tax_amount: **3333.64**\n25. Sale20240122047 -> tax_amount: **18973.62**\n26. Sale20240123048 -> tax_amount: **28841.35**\n27. Sale20240123049 -> tax_amount: **2999.43**\n28. Sale20240124050 -> tax_amount: **11738.84**\n\n### Step 3: Summing the Tax Amounts\n\nNow, we sum all the values:\n\n- **Sum of tax amounts**: \n- 11248.06 + 2897.86 + 6152.17 + 16231.44 + 1786.54 + 10376.60 + 3779.07 + 11337.25 + 33066.13 + 575.25 + 5621.11 + 2224.61 + 8728.06 + 13918.78 + 2644.84 + 2858.33 + 3177.12 + 2671.84 + 6219.33 + 5641.87 + 13636.62 + 5575.52 + 3333.64 + 18973.62 + 28841.35 + 2999.43 + 11738.84\n\nCalculating the sum gives **271550.92** as the total taxes payable at the end.\n\n### Final Results\n\nNow that we have computed the initial and final values, we can present them in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Taxes Payable Initial Value': '0.00', 'Taxes Payable End Value': '271550.92'}}\n```",
