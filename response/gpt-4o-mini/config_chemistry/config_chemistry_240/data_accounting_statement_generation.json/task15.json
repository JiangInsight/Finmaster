                        "content": "To compute the total liabilities from the provided transaction data, we will focus on transactions associated with the \"Purchase\" entries that have outstanding payments recorded in an \"Account Payable\" status, as they contribute to liabilities. All initial values start at zero.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1. **Identify Initial Liabilities:**\n   The initial liabilities are given in the provided transactions:\n   - Cash deposit: Cash is an asset and does not contribute to liabilities.\n   - Bank deposit: Similarly a deposit is an asset.\n   - Fixed Assets: This also does not affect liabilities as it's an asset.\n   - The initial liabilities amount is **0.00** as none of these transactions affect liabilities.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Purchases (Liabilities):**\n   To identify the liabilities that were recorded:\n   - We will look for transactions marked \"Purchase\" where the \"payment/receipt_status\" is \"Unpaid\" for account payable, as they indicate a liability owed:\n     - `Purchase20231231002` - Amount: 800000.0 (Unpaid)\n     - `Purchase20231231004` - Amount: 750000.0 (Unpaid)\n     - `Purchase20231231010` - Amount: 1250000.0 (Unpaid)\n     - `Purchase20231231012` - Amount: 210000.0 (Unpaid)\n\n3. **Calculate Total Liabilities at End:**\n   Adding these amounts gives us the total end liabilities:\n   - 800000.0 + 750000.0 + 1250000.0 + 210000.0 = **2865000.0**\n\n### Final Calculation Summary\n- **Total Liabilities Initial Value**: 0.00\n- **Total Liabilities End Value**: 2865000.00\n\n### Answer in Required Format\nHere's the JSON format for the solution:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Liabilities Initial Value': '0.00', 'Total Liabilities End Value': '2865000.00'}}\n```",
