The COGS represents the inventory that has been sold during the reporting period, and it is typically derived from the change in inventory levels combined with purchases and other factors.\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Identify the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** from the income statement. \n   - Looking at the income statement, the Cost of Goods Sold is reported as:\n     - **Cost of Goods Sold**: **6290000.00**\n\n2. **Provide this value** as the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period is 6290000.00.\n\nNow, we present the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6290000.00'} }\n```",
