Other items are not directly associated with expenses.\n\n2. **Initial and End Values for Accumulated Depreciation**\n   - **Initial Amount (as of 2023-12-31)**: 0.00\n   - **End Amount (as of 2024-01-30)**: 45753.36\n\n3. **Initial and Final Values Extraction**\n   - Based on the identified account, the initial value is 0.00 and the end value is 45753.36.\n\nNow, we'll present the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '45753.36'} }\n```",
