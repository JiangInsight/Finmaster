Within this section, we identify any relevant transactions that contribute to cash flows.\n\n1. **Identify Cash Flow from Investing Activities**: \n   - Here we have:\n     - Purchase of Fixed Assets: **324677.57**\n   - Since this is a cash outflow (purchase), it will be recorded as a negative value in the cash flow calculation.\n\n2. **Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities**:\n   - The net amount is given as **-324677.57** which derives from the purchase of fixed assets, indicating cash spent in investing activities.\n\n3. **Break Down into Sub-Items**: \n   - The sub-item here is the \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" which amounts to **324677.57**. \n\nWe can now present our findings in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-324677.57', 'sub_items_sub_item value': '324677.57'}}\n```",
