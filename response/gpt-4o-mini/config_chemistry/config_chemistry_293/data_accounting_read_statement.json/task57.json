This typically involves looking at the liabilities section where we focus on Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the balance sheet for liabilities.**\n- **Accounts Payable:**\n  - Initial Amount: 0.00\n  - End Amount: 2,100,000.00\n\n- **Taxes Payable:**\n  - Initial Amount: 0.00\n  - End Amount: 391,297.55\n\n**Step 2: Determine the addition in liabilities.**\n- **Accounts Payable**: The increase from 0 to 2,100,000.00 indicates that the company has accrued this amount as payable for credit transactions.\n- **Taxes Payable**: The increase from 0 to 391,297.55 indicates that the company has accrued this amount as payable towards taxes.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the additions.**\n- **Total Increase in Accounts Payable**: 2,100,000.00\n- **Total Increase in Taxes Payable**: 391,297.55\n\nSince the task specifies to extract the specific line items and value of the addition in the amount owed by the entity, we'll focus on the most relevant figure related to goods and services, which is typically captured under Accounts Payable as the primary indicator of credit purchases for goods/services.\n\nThus, the addition in the amount owed for goods or services (from Accounts Payable) is **2,100,000.00**.\n\nNow, we can present the answer in the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '2100000.00'} }\n```",
