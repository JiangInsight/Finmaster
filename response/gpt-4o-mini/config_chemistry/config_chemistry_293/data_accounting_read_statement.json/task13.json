                        "content": "To solve for the total assets that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle, we first need to identify the relevant line items within the balance sheet provided in the problem.\n\nIn the provided balance sheet, we can categorize the accounts into two main groups:\n1. Current Assets: These typically include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, etc., that are expected to be realized or consumed within one year.\n2. Non-current Assets: These typically include fixed assets, which are not expected to be realized or consumed within a year. \n\nFrom the given data, the line items under each category are:\n- **Total Current Assets** (includes cash, bank deposits, interest receivable, accounts receivable, inventory) \n- **Total Non-current Assets** (includes fixed assets)\n\n### Breakdown of Components:\n1. **Total Current Assets**:\n    - Cash on Hand: 3000000.00 (2023-12-31) to 1753673.43 (2024-01-30)\n    - Bank Deposits: 5000000.00 (2023-12-31) to 1522888.62 (2024-01-30)\n    - Interest Receivable: 0.00 (2023-12-31) to 5758.38 (2024-01-30)\n    - Accounts Receivable: 0.00 (2023-12-31) to 1988616.02 (2024-01-30)\n    - Inventory: 0.00 (2023-12-31) to 3540000.00 (2024-01-30)\n    - **Total Current Assets**: 8000000.00 (2023-12-31) to 8810936.45 (2024-01-30)\n\n2. **Total Non-current Assets**:\n    - Fixed Assets: 5000000.00 (2023-12-31) to 5324677.57 (2024-01-30)\n    - Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00 (2023-12-31) to 45753.36 (2024-01-30)\n    - **Total Non-current Assets**: 5000000.00 (2023-12-31) to 5278924.21 (2024-01-30)\n\n### Calculation:\nTotal Non-current Assets (which are expected to not be realized or consumed in the usual cycle):\n- **Initial Non-current Assets** = 5000000.00\n- **End Non-current Assets** = 5278924.21\n\n### Final Derivation:\nThe answer structure will be:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5278924.21'}}\n```\nThe value of Non-current Assets reflects what is not intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle, meeting the requirements of the task. \n\n### Solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5278924.21'}}\n```",
