Specifically, we are interested in calculating the Gross Profit, which is the difference between the Total Revenue and the Cost of Goods Sold.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the relevant figures:\n\n1. **Total Revenue**:\n   - **Total Revenue** is listed as **7825951.24**.\n\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**:\n   - The **Cost of Goods Sold** is listed as **6290000.00**.\n\n3. **Calculation of Gross Profit**:\n   We compute the **Gross Profit** using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Cost of Goods Sold}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gross Profit} = 7825951.24 - 6290000.00 = 1535951.24\n   \\]\n\nSince we are looking for the value of the difference between revenue and cost (i.e., Gross Profit), which is explicitly provided in the income statement as **1535951.24**, we can directly use this figure for our solution.\n\nHere’s the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1535951.24'}}\n```",
