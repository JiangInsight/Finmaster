This line item generally represents the total amount shareholders have contributed to the company for its stock.\n\nWe will examine both the initial and final values listed for the \"Paid-in Capital\":\n\n1. **Identifying the relevant line item**: \n   - In the balance sheet, we can locate \"Paid-in Capital\" as follows:\n     - Initial Amount: 13000000.00\n     - End Amount: 13000000.00\n\n2. **Extracting the values**:\n   - The \"Initial value\" of \"Paid-in Capital\" is 13000000.00.\n   - The \"End value\" of \"Paid-in Capital\" is also 13000000.00.\n\nSince the values have not changed from the start to the end of the period, they represent the total capital contributed by shareholders for the shares throughout the period examined.\n\nNow, we can construct the answer in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
