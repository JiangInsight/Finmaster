This line item typically represents the amount the company expects to pay in taxes for the reporting period.\n   - In the **balance sheet**, there's a line item for **Taxes Payable**. This item, however, represents the amount of taxes that are owed as of the end of the reporting period, not the expense incurred during the period.\n\n2. **Finding Relevant Values**:\n   - From the **income statement**, we look at the line:\n     - **Tax Expense**: 391297.55\n   \n   This amount reflects the total tax expense for the reporting period, which we are interested in.\n\n3. **Verification of Other Statements**:\n   - The **balance sheet** shows the **Taxes Payable** amount of 391297.55, which corresponds to the amount that needs to be paid out. However, since the Tax Expense is the measure of tax for the income period, this confirms our relevant figure remains the same as per the income statement.\n\n4. **Consolidating the Information**:\n   - We concluded that the relevant amount from the tax line item is:\n     - Total expected tax payment/recovery (based on income statement): 391297.55\n\n5. **Formatting the Answer**:\n   - We will present this figure in the required JSON format.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '391297.55'} }\n```",
