The main line item that addresses the costs directly related to producing and delivering goods and services is the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS). Additionally, \"Selling Expenses\" can also be associated with costs incurred to secure customer orders.\n\nHereâ€™s a breakdown of relevant items:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold**: This represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company. In this income statement, the value is **6290000.00**.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses**: These represent the costs incurred to secure customer orders, including advertising, sales force expenses, and other marketing costs. In this statement, the value is **627729.56**.\n\nNext, to find the total costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services, we add the values of the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" and \"Selling Expenses\":\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: **6290000.00**\n- Selling Expenses: **627729.56**\n  \nTotal Costs = 6290000.00 + 627729.56 = **6917729.56**\n\nHowever, for the purpose of the solution, we only need the Selling Expenses as per the example format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '627729.56'} }\n```",
