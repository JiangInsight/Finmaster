Identify the line item that represents the net profit. In the cash flow statement provided, this is labeled as \"Net Profit.\"\n2. Read the amount associated with \"Net Profit.\" In this case, it shows as \"-1401436.89.\"\n3. This value effectively represents the profit (or loss, as indicated by the negative sign) after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, have been accounted for.\n\nGiven that, we will structure our answer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1401436.89'} }\n```",
