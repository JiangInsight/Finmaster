Other accounts like \"Accounts Receivable\" could indirectly relate if they pertain to goods that are available for sale, but the main focus will be on \"Inventory\".\n\n2. **Initial and End amounts for \"Inventory\"**:\n   - The \"Initial_amount\" for \"Inventory\" is `0.00` as of `2023-12-31`.\n   - The \"End_amount\" is `3540000.00` as of `2024-01-30`.\n\n3. **Final structure**: \n   - We will document these amounts in the required JSON format for the solution.\n\nNow, to present the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '3540000.00'} }\n```",
