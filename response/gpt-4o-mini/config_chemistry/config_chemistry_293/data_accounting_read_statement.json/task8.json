Therefore, we will not include this in our solution.\n\n3. **Total Current Liabilities**: This is the sum of all current liabilities but does not directly show the specific amounts for goods or services on credit.\n\nThe only relevant line item that fits the criteria is **Accounts Payable**.\n\nNow we compile the initial and final values from this account into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '2100000.00'}}\n```",
