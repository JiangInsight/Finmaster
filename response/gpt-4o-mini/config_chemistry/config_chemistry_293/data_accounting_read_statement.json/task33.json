                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify and extract two specific line items from the provided income statement: \n1. The value arising from the entity's core operating activities, which corresponds to \"Main Business Revenue\" or \"Total Revenue.\"\n2. The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period, represented by \"Cost of Goods Sold.\"\n\nWe will extract the values for these line items in the order they are presented in the income statement.\n\nHere's the income statement provided:\n\n```\n| Account                 | Amount      | Date       |\n| ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |\n| Main Business Revenue    | 7825951.24 | 2024-01-30 |\n| Total Revenue            | 7825951.24 | 2024-01-30 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold       | 6290000.00 | 2024-01-30 |\n| Total Cost               | 6290000.00 | 2024-01-30 |\n| Gross Profit             | 1535951.24 | 2024-01-30 |\n| Administrative Expenses   | 1335153.59 | 2024-01-30 |\n| Selling Expenses          | 627729.56  | 2024-01-30 |\n| Depreciation             | 45753.36   | 2024-01-30 |\n| Financial Expenses        | 543212.45  | 2024-01-30 |\n| Total Expenses            | 2551848.96 | 2024-01-30 |\n| Interest Income           | 5758.38    | 2024-01-30 |\n| Profit Before Tax        | -1010139.34| 2024-01-30 |\n| Tax Expense               | 391297.55  | 2024-01-30 |\n| Net Profit                | -1401436.89| 2024-01-30 |\n```\n\nNow, I will extract the relevant values:\n\n1. **Value from Core Operating Activities (Main Business Revenue)**\n   - This is taken from the first relevant line item: **Main Business Revenue: 7825951.24**\n   \n2. **Carrying Amount of Inventories Sold (Cost of Goods Sold)**\n   - This is taken from the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" line: **Cost of Goods Sold: 6290000.00**\n\nNow, putting these values into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7825951.24', 'value2': '6290000.00'}}\n```",
