Balance Sheet\nFrom the Balance Sheet, we need to identify:\n- **Capital contributed by shareholders in exchange for shares**: This is represented by \"Paid-in Capital\". \n- **Addition in the amount owed by the entity for goods or services received or purchased on credit during the period**: This refers to \"Accounts Payable\" as it reflects amounts owed to suppliers.\n\nRelevant line items:\n- **Paid-in Capital**: 13000000.00\n- **Accounts Payable**: 2100000.00\n\n### 2. Income Statement\nFrom the Income Statement, we must identify:\n- **End value of profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense**: This is the \"Profit Before Tax\".\n\nRelevant line item:\n- **Profit Before Tax**: -1010139.34\n\n### 3. Cash Flow Statement\nIn the Cash Flow Statement, we do not have any additional information that pertains to the required items beyond what we've already captured in the Balance Sheet and Income Statement.\n\nSummarizing the extracted values:\n- **Paid-in Capital (Balance Sheet)**: 13000000.00\n- **Profit Before Tax (Income Statement)**: -1010139.34\n- **Accounts Payable (Balance Sheet)**: 2100000.00\n\nNow, we need to format the solution according to the specified JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '13000000.00', 'value2': '-1010139.34', 'value3': '2100000.00'}}\n``` \n\nThis captures the required line items in the correct order from their respective financial statements.",
