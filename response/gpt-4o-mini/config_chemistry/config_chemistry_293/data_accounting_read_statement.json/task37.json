Looking through the provided cash flow statement, we focus on the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section for information on expenses related to depreciation:\n   - The specific line that generally represents depreciation is labeled simply as \"Depreciation\".\n\n2. Under the \"Cash Flow From Operating Activities\" section, we locate the line:\n   - **Depreciation: 45753.36** (as per the provided data)\n\n3. Since this value represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life, we can confirm this is the value we are looking for.\n\nTherefore, the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount extracted from the cash flow statement is **45753.36**.\n\nNow, we format the answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45753.36'} }\n```",
