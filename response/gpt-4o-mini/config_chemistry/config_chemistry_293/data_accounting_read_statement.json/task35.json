The required line items are as follows:\n\n1. **Selling Expenses** - This represents the costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers.\n2. **Depreciation** - This is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n3. **Financial Expenses** - This refers to the financing costs incurred by an enterprise to raise funds needed for production and operation.\n4. **Tax Expense** - This is the total amount of taxes an entity is expected to pay or recover during a reporting period.\n\nNow, let's find these values from the provided income statement:\n\n1. From the income statement, **Selling Expenses** is listed as: \n   - Selling Expenses: **627729.56**\n   \n2. **Depreciation** is stated as:\n   - Depreciation: **45753.36**\n   \n3. The **Financial Expenses** are shown as:\n   - Financial Expenses: **543212.45**\n   \n4. Finally, the **Tax Expense** is reflected as:\n   - Tax Expense: **391297.55**\n\nNow, we will compile these extracted values into a JSON formatted string, ensuring the order remains consistent with the items listed above.\n\nPutting it all together, the response will look like this:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '627729.56', 'value2': '45753.36', 'value3': '543212.45', 'value4': '391297.55'} }\n```",
