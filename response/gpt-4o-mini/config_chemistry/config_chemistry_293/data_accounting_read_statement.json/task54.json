                        "content": "To find the specific line item and value of costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver goods and services to customers, we can typically look at two main line items from the income statement: \n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** - This represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by the company. It includes costs of materials and labor directly used to create the product.\n2. **Selling Expenses** - This includes costs related to selling the products, such as marketing, sales commissions, and other costs directly associated with securing orders from customers.\n\nFrom the provided income statement:\n\n| Account | Amount | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | 6290000.00 | 2024-01-30 |\n| Selling Expenses | 627729.56 | 2024-01-30 |\n\nNow, we add these two amounts together to get the total costs incurred for securing customer orders and delivering goods and services.\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold: $6290000.00\n- Selling Expenses: $627729.56\n\nTotal Costs = COGS + Selling Expenses\nTotal Costs = 6290000.00 + 627729.56 = 6917729.56\n\nHowever, since the task specifically asks for costs incurred to secure customer orders and deliver the goods and services, \"Selling Expenses\" is also an important part which contributes to this.\n\nThus, the answer will take selling expenses into account.\n\nGiven this, the solution must present the value of selling expenses alone, which will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '627729.56'}}\n```",
