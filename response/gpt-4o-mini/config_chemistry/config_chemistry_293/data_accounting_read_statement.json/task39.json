The line item that mentions the reduction in assets held for sale or in production for such sale or in the process of being manufactured is labeled as \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\".\n2. The value next to this line item is **-3540000.00**. This indicates a decrease in inventory, which typically signifies a reduction in assets relating to inventory on hand, and can be related to assets held for sale, production for sale, or manufacturing processes.\n  \nTherefore, the required value extracted from the cash flow statement reflecting the reduction in the amount of assets in inventory is **-3540000.00**.\n\nNow, I will format the answer as specified:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-3540000.00'} }\n```",
