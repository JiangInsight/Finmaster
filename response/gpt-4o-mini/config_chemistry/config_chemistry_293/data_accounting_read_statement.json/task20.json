Key terms we are interested in are related to the cost associated with selling inventory.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Line Items**: The line items we should focus on related to inventory are:\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This reflects the total cost of the inventory that was sold during the period.\n\n3. **Locate COGS**: In the given income statement, we find the line item for **Cost of Goods Sold**:\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold**: 6290000.00\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period corresponds to the recorded amount of COGS, which is 6290000.00.\n\nNow, we will format the answer according to the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '6290000.00'} }\n```",
