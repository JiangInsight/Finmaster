                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to extract three specific values from the provided income statement: \n\n1. Total income arising from the entity's ordinary activities.\n2. Carrying amount of inventories sold during the reporting period (which is represented by the cost of goods sold).\n3. Costs of general management and administration of the entity as a whole (which is represented by administrative expenses).\n\nLet's go through the income statement step by step:\n\n1. **Total Income from Ordinary Activities**: \n   - The relevant line items are \"Main Business Revenue\" and \"Total Revenue\". In this case, both values are the same: \n     - **Total Revenue** = 7825951.24\n\n2. **Carrying Amount of Inventories Sold**: \n   - The line item representing this is \"Cost of Goods Sold\":\n     - **Cost of Goods Sold** = 6290000.00\n\n3. **Costs of General Management and Administration**: \n   - The line item that represents this is \"Administrative Expenses\":\n     - **Administrative Expenses** = 1335153.59\n\nNow, we will present the answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '7825951.24', 'value2': '6290000.00', 'value3': '1335153.59'}}\n```",
