Current assets are those expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal operating cycle of the entity. \n\nHere are the accounts that are typically classified as current assets based on the provided data:\n\n1. **Cash on Hand**\n2. **Bank Deposits**\n3. **Interest Receivable**\n4. **Accounts Receivable**\n5. **Inventory**\n6. **Total Current Assets** - This line includes the sum of the above current assets.\n\nNext, we will sum the initial values and end values of these current assets.\n\n### Initial Values of Current Assets:\n- Cash on Hand: 3,000,000.00\n- Bank Deposits: 5,000,000.00\n- Interest Receivable: 0.00\n- Accounts Receivable: 0.00\n- Inventory: 0.00\n\nSumming these:\n**Total Initial Current Assets = 3,000,000.00 + 5,000,000.00 + 0.00 + 0.00 + 0.00 = 8,000,000.00**\n\n### End Values of Current Assets:\n- Cash on Hand: 1,753,673.43\n- Bank Deposits: 1,522,888.62\n- Interest Receivable: 5,758.38\n- Accounts Receivable: 1,988,616.02\n- Inventory: 3,540,000.00\n\nSumming these:\n**Total End Current Assets = 1,753,673.43 + 1,522,888.62 + 5,758.38 + 1,988,616.02 + 3,540,000.00 = 8,810,936.45**\n\nNow that we have both the initial and end values of total current assets, we can present them in the required JSON format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '8000000.00', 'end value': '8810936.45'}}\n```",
