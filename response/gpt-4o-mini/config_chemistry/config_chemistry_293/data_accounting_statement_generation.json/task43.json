Here's how we can do this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Cash Inflows**:\n   - Cash inflows from \"Sale\" transactions that have \"Paid\" status.\n   - Cash inflows from \"Sale\" transactions that have \"Unpaid\" status, but only at the time they are actually received. For this exercise, we'll only count the \"Paid\" sales.\n\n2. **Identify Cash Outflows**:\n   - Cash outflows from \"Expense\" transactions that have \"Paid\" status.\n   - Cash outflows from \"Purchase\" transactions that have \"Paid\" status (ignoring unpaid purchases since they do not result in cash outflow until paid).\n\n3. **Calculate Total Inflows**:\n   For each sale, we'll sum the amounts where the payment status is \"Paid\".\n\n4. **Calculate Total Outflows**:\n   For each expense and purchase, we'll sum the amounts where the payment status is \"Paid\".\n\n5. **Calculate Net Cash Flow**:\n   Use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} = \\text{Total Cash Inflows} - \\text{Total Cash Outflows}\n   \\]\n\nNow, letâ€™s extract the relevant data based on the provided structure:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Cash Inflows (Sales - Paid)\n| id                | type | amount     | payment/receipt_status |\n|-------------------|------|------------|------------------------|\n| Sale20240102002   | Sale | 11498.27   | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240103004   | Sale | 93580.28   | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240106010   | Sale | 116898.14  | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240107011   | Sale | 659298.95  | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240108013   | Sale | 267311.66  | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240111017   | Sale | 67132.14   | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240111018   | Sale | 134717.66  | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240112020   | Sale | 644182.50  | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240122050   | Sale | 411855.06  | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240122051   | Sale | 265712.00  | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240123052   | Sale | 47800.68   | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240124054   | Sale | 128615.27  | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240125055   | Sale | 134146.46  | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240126060   | Sale | 135563.82  | Paid                   |\n| Sale20240127062   | Sale | 575061.65  | Paid                   |\n\nTotal Cash Inflows Calculation:\n\\[\n11498.27 + 93580.28 + 116898.14 + 659298.95 + 267311.66 + 67132.14 + 134717.66 + 644182.50 + 411855.06 + 265712.00 + 47800.68 + 128615.27 + 134146.46 + 135563.82 + 575061.65 = 2792376.07\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify Cash Outflows (Expenses and Purchases -
