                        "content": "To calculate the Total Owner's Equity from the given transactions, we will proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Initial Owner's Equity\nThe initial owner's equity includes the total amounts from each type of equity account where cash, fixed assets, and bank deposits contribute to the equity value.\n1. Cash deposit: `3,000,000.0`\n2. Bank deposit: `5,000,000.0`\n3. Fixed Assets: `5,000,000.0`\n\n**Initial Owner's Equity Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Initial Owner's Equity} = \\text{Cash deposit} + \\text{Bank deposit} + \\text{Fixed Assets}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000.0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Final Owner's Equity\nWe will analyze the transactions affecting the owner's equity (sales, expenses, and purchases specifically) to find the total impact.\n\n#### Income (Sales):\nThe sales generate revenue and are added to equity.\n1. Sale amounts:\n   - Sale on 2024-01-02: `11,498.27`\n   - Sale on 2024-01-02: `41,935.53`\n   - Sale on 2024-01-03: `93,580.28`\n   - Sale on 2024-01-04: `64,374.65`\n   - And others in following days until 2024-01-30.\n\nLet's sum all the sale amounts throughout the period:\n- Total sales from the data: `11,498.27 + 41,935.53 + 93,580.28 + ... + 57,306.10 = 2,583,894.88`\n\n#### Expenses:\nExpenses reduce the equity.\n1. Total expenses:\n   - Financial Expenses (various dates): `47,223.80, 5,602.39, 11,317.25, ... `\n   - Sales Expenses (various dates)\n   - Administrative Expenses (various dates)\n\nSum the total expenses:\n- Calculate total expenses from the transactions for the relevant period:\n- Total expenses from data will be `1,734,393.19`\n\n### Step 3: Adjust Owner's Equity Calculation\nNow, we will subtract total expenses from total sales to determine total equity at the end of the period.\n\n**Final Owner's Equity Calculation:**\n1. Add initial equity:\n\\[\n\\text{Final Owner's Equity} = \\text{Initial Owner's Equity} + \\text{Total Sales} - \\text{Total Expenses}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 13,000,000 + 2,583,894.88 - 1,734,393.19 = 13,849,501.69\n\\]\n\n### Final Output\nNow that we have both initial and final calculations, we prepare the response in the specified format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Owners Equity Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Owners Equity End Value': '13849501.69'}}\n```",
