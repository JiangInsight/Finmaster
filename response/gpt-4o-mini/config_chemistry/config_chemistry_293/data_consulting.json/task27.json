                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate three financial ratios: the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio, the Current Assets Turnover Ratio, and the Quick Ratio. Let's break each calculation down step by step using the provided data.\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:**\n   - We need to find the Operating Cash Flow (from Cash Flow statement) and the Net Income (from Income statement).\n   - From the cash flow statement, the Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities is given as: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities} = -4398760.38\n     \\]\n   - From the income statement, the Net Profit is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Profit} = -1401436.89\n     \\]\n   - The Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Net Income}} = \\frac{-4398760.38}{-1401436.89}\n     \\]\n   - Performing the calculation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = 3.14 \\text{ (approx)}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio:**\n   - The Current Assets Turnover Ratio measures how effectively a company uses its current assets to generate sales revenue.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Total Current Assets}}\n     \\]\n   - Total Revenue from Income statement:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Revenue} = 7825951.24\n     \\]\n   - Average Total Current Assets can be approximated as the mean between the beginning and end values from the balance sheet:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Current Assets (beginning)} = 8000000.00\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Current Assets (end)} = 8810936.45\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average Total Current Assets} = \\frac{8000000.00 + 8810936.45}{2} \\approx 8405468.23\n     \\]\n   - Now, substituting into the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{7825951.24}{8405468.23} \\approx 0.93\n     \\]\n\n3. **Quick Ratio:**\n   - The Quick Ratio measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It excludes inventories from current assets.\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - From the balance sheet:\n     - Inventory at end = 3540000.00\n     - Total Current Assets at end = 8810936.45\n     - Total Current Liabilities at end = 2491297.55\n   - Quick Assets calculation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Total Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory} = 8810936.45 - 3540000.00 = 5270936.45\n     \\]\n   - Now, substituting into the Quick Ratio formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{5270936.45}{2491297.55} \\approx 2.12\n     \\]\n\nFinally, putting all three calculated ratios together in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '3.14', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.93', 'Quick Ratio': '2.12'}} \n```",
