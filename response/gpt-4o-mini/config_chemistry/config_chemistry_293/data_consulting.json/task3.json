                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Total Liabilities**: \n   - From the balance sheet provided, we need to identify the total liabilities. This can be found by adding the current liabilities (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable):\n     - Accounts Payable: 2,100,000.00\n     - Taxes Payable: 391,297.55\n     - Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable\n     - Total Current Liabilities = 2,100,000.00 + 391,297.55 = 2,491,297.55\n\n2. **Total Liabilities**: \n   - In this example, it seems like total liabilities consist only of the total current liabilities (as no additional long-term debts are listed).\n   - Therefore, Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 2,491,297.55\n\n3. **Identify Total Assets**: \n   - From the balance sheet, Total Assets is clearly mentioned as 14,089,860.66.\n\n4. **Calculate Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   - The formula for the Debt to Asset Ratio is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n     \\]\n\n   - Substitute the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{2,491,297.55}{14,089,860.66}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = 0.176\n   \\]\n\n6. **Format the Result**:\n   To match the expected output format, we represent our answer in a JSON structure.\n\nThe calculated Debt to Asset Ratio is approximately 0.176 (rounded). Therefore, the final output would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.18'}}\n```",
