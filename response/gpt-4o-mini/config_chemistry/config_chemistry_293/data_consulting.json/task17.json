The formula for the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Determine Total Liabilities\n\nFrom the balance sheet provided, we can identify the total liabilities, which includes current liabilities such as Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable:\n\n1. **Total Current Liabilities:**\n   - Accounts Payable: 2,100,000.00\n   - Taxes Payable: 391,297.55\n   - Total Current Liabilities: 2,100,000.00 + 391,297.55 = 2,491,297.55\n\nSince there are no long-term debts or liabilities listed, Total Liabilities will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Liabilities} = \\text{Total Current Liabilities} = 2,491,297.55\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, we see the following values listed under the operating activities:\n\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities: -4,398,760.38\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nNow we can apply the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} = \\frac{-4,398,760.38}{2,491,297.55}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cash Flow to Debt Ratio} \\approx -1.77\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Present the Final Solution\n\nBased on our calculations, the Cash Flow to Debt Ratio is approximately -1.77. \n\nHere is the final answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Cash Flow to Debt Ratio': '-1.77'} }\n```",
