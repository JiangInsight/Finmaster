                        "content": "To calculate the requested financial ratios, we'll follow these definitions and calculations step by step:\n\n1. **Debt to Equity Ratio**: This ratio measures a company's financial leverage. It is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n   \\]\n\n   From the balance sheet:\n   - Total Assets = 14089860.66 \n   - Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity\n     - Total Owner's Equity = 11598563.11\n     - Total Liabilities = 14089860.66 - 11598563.11 = 2481287.55\n\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{2481287.55}{11598563.11} \\approx 0.214\n   \\]\n\n2. **Net Profit Margin**: This ratio shows how much profit a company makes for each dollar of revenue. It is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n   From the income statement:\n   - Net Profit = -1401436.89\n   - Total Revenue = 7825951.24\n\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{-1401436.89}{7825951.24} \\times 100 \\approx -17.91\\%\n   \\]\n\n3. **Return on Assets (ROA)**: This indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. It is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Return on Assets (ROA)} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\times 100\n   \\]\n\n   From the balance sheet:\n   - Total Assets = 14089860.66\n\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Return on Assets (ROA)} = \\frac{-1401436.89}{14089860.66} \\times 100 \\approx -9.94\\%\n   \\]\n\n4. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**: This measures how efficiently a company uses its assets. It is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n   \\]\n\n   Here we must assume that the Accounts Receivable at the beginning of the period was zero, as it was specified as such in the problem. So:\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = (End Amount + Initial Amount) / 2\n   - Average Accounts Receivable = (1988616.02 + 0) / 2 = 994308.01 \n\n   Finally:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{7825951.24}{994308.01} \\approx 7.87\n   \\]\n\nNow, compiling these calculations:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.21', 'Net Profit Margin': '-17.91%', 'Return on Assets (ROA)': '-9.94%', 'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.87'}}\n```",
