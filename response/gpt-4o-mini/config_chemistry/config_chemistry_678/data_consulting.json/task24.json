                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate two financial ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio and the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio, using the information from the balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet, we identify the following:\n- Total Liabilities: This is the sum of Current Liabilities. \n  - Total Current Liabilities = Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable \n  - Total Current Liabilities = 737762.05 (given in the balance sheet)\n  \n  Thus, the Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities = 737762.05.\n\n- Total Assets: Total Assets = 12385382.42 (given in the balance sheet).\n\nNow, we can calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{737762.05}{12385382.42} \\approx 0.0595\n\\]\nTo express this in terms of percentage:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = 0.0595 \\approx 0.06\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n- Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7724112.71\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- Net Income = -1352379.63\n\nNow, we can calculate the Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-7724112.71}{-1352379.63} \\approx 5.72\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Format the Results in JSON\n\nNow, we format the results into the requested JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.06', 'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '5.72'}}\n```",
