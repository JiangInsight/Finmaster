                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate three key financial ratios: the Debt to Asset Ratio, Gross Profit Margin, and Operating Cash Flow Ratio based on the provided financial statements. Let's break down the calculations step by step.\n\n### 1. Debt to Asset Ratio\n\nThe Debt to Asset Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n- **Total Assets**: \\$12,385,382.42\n- **Total Liabilities**: This includes **Total Current Liabilities** (Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable):\n  - Accounts Payable: \\$450,000.00\n  - Taxes Payable: \\$287,762.05\n  - Total Current Liabilities: \\$737,762.05\n\n  Since there are no other specified liabilities, we can assume Total Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities.\n  \nSo, \n\\[\n\\text{Total Liabilities} = 737,762.05\n\\]\n\nNow we can calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{737,762.05}{12,385,382.42} \\approx 0.0595 \\text{ or } 5.95\\%\n\\]\n\n### 2. Gross Profit Margin\n\nThe Gross Profit Margin is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- **Gross Profit**: \\$1,075,241.17\n- **Total Revenue**: \\$5,755,241.17\n\nNow we can calculate the Gross Profit Margin:\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{1,075,241.17}{5,755,241.17} \\times 100 \\approx 18.69\\%\n\\]\n\n### 3. Operating Cash Flow Ratio\n\nThe Operating Cash Flow Ratio is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the cash flow statement, we have:\n- **Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities (Operating Cash Flow)**: \\$-7,724,112.71\n- **Current Liabilities**: \\$737,762.05 (as calculated earlier)\n\nNow we can calculate the Operating Cash Flow Ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-7,724,112.71}{737,762.05} \\approx -10.47\n\\]\n\n### Solution Output\n\nNow that we have calculated all three ratios, we can present our results in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.0595', 'Gross Profit Margin': '18.69%', 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio': '-10.47'}}\n``` \n\n### Final Note:\nThe calculations were rounded and conversions were done step by step with clear data references. The values shown in the output have been accurately derived from the information presented in the financial statements.",
