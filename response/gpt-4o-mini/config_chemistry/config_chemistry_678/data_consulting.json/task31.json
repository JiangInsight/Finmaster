                        "content": "To calculate the required financial ratios, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Extract relevant values\n\nFrom the **balance sheet**, we need the following values:\n\n- **Accounts Receivable** (end amount): 1,604,015.21\n- **Total Current Liabilities** (end amount): 737,762.05\n- **Total Assets** (end amount): 12,385,382.42\n- **Total Owner's Equity** (end amount): 11,647,620.37\n- **Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: -7,724,112.71 (operating cash flow)\n\nFrom the **income statement**, we also need:\n\n- **Total Revenue**: 5,755,241.17\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the ratios\n\n#### 1. **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**\nThis ratio indicates how many times a business can turn its accounts receivable into cash during a period.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n\\]\n\nWe'll assume beginning accounts receivable was 0 for simplicity, then average accounts receivable = (0 + 1,604,015.21) / 2 = 802,007.605.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,755,241.17}{802,007.605} \\approx 7.17\n\\]\n\n#### 2. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**\nThis ratio indicates how well current liabilities can be covered by the cash flow from operating activities.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \\frac{-7,724,112.71}{737,762.05} \\approx -10.47\n\\]\n\n#### 3. **Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio**\nSimilar to the operating cash flow ratio, but can be interpreted slightly differently based on context. In this case, it yields the same formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Total Current Liabilities}} \n\\]\n\nIt results in the same value as the operating cash flow ratio, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Operating Cash Flow to Current Liabilities Ratio} \\approx -10.47\n\\]\n\n#### 4. **Total Asset Turnover Ratio**\nThis ratio measures the efficiency of a firm's use of its assets in generating sales revenue.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5,755,241.17}{12,385,382.42} \\approx 0.46\n\\]\n\n#### 5. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\nThis ratio shows the relative proportions of debt and equity financing.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Owner's Equity}}\n\\]\n\nTo get total liabilities:\nTotal Liabilities = Total Assets - Total Owner's Equity = 12,385,382.42 - 11,647,620.37 = 737,762.05\n\nNow calculating the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \\frac{737,762.05}{11,647,620.37} \\approx 0.0633 \\text{ (or simplified to 0.06)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Format the solution\n\nNow we can present the computed ratios in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio': '7.17', 'operating cash flow ratio': '-10.47', 'operating cash flow to current liabilities ratio': '-10.47', 'Total Asset Turnover Ratio': '0.46', 'Debt to Equity Ratio': '0.06'}}\n```",
