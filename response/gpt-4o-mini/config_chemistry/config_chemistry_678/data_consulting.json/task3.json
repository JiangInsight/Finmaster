                        "content": "To calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio, we first need to determine the total liabilities and total assets from the given balance sheet. \n\n1. **Extract Total Assets**:\n   From the provided data, at the end of the reporting period, the total assets are noted as:\n   - Total Assets: **$12,385,382.42**\n\n2. **Extract Total Liabilities**:\n   Total Liabilities can be calculated as the sum of current liabilities. From the provided data:\n   - Accounts Payable: **$450,000.00**\n   - Taxes Payable: **$287,762.05**\n   - Total Current Liabilities: **$737,762.05** \n\n   Assuming that these are the only liabilities in this context (since no long-term liabilities are listed), we can conclude that:\n   - Total Liabilities: **$737,762.05**\n\n3. **Calculate Total Owner's Equity**:\n   Although we are not directly using this value for the debt to asset ratio calculation, it is useful to know:\n   - Total Ownerâ€™s Equity: **$11,647,620.37**\n\n4. **Calculate the Debt to Asset Ratio**:\n   The Debt to Asset Ratio formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Liabilities}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting the previously found values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} = \\frac{737762.05}{12385382.42}\n   \\]\n\n   Performing the calculation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Debt to Asset Ratio} \\approx 0.0595 \\text{ (rounded to 4 decimal places)}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert to percentage (optional)**:\n   If needed, the ratio can be expressed as a percentage:\n   \\[\n   0.0595 \\times 100 \\approx 5.95\\%\n   \\]\n\nPutting this into the required json format, we present the solution as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Debt to Asset Ratio': '0.0595'}}\n```",
