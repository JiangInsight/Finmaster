                        "content": "To solve the problem, we will calculate the following financial ratios based on the given balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement:\n\n1. **Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio**: \n   This ratio indicates how well a company generates cash from its operations relative to its net income.\n\n   Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities}}{\\text{Net Income}}\n   \\]\n\n   From the cash flow statement:\n   - Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities = -7724112.71\n\n   From the income statement:\n   - Net Income = -1352379.63\n   \n   Now plug in these values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio} = \\frac{-7724112.71}{-1352379.63} \\approx 5.72\n   \\]\n\n\n2. **Current Assets Turnover Ratio**: \n   This ratio measures a company's efficiency at using its current assets to generate revenue.\n\n   Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Average Current Assets}}\n   \\]\n\n   We calculate Total Revenue from the income statement:\n   - Total Revenue = 5755241.17\n\n   To calculate Average Current Assets, we need the current assets at the beginning and the end of the period:\n   - Total Current Assets at the beginning (2023-12-31) = 8000000.00\n   - Total Current Assets at the end (2024-01-29) = 6951011.84\n\n   Average Current Assets:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Current Assets} = \\frac{8000000.00 + 6951011.84}{2} = 7475505.92\n   \\]\n\n   Now plug in to find the Current Assets Turnover Ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Current Assets Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{5755241.17}{7475505.92} \\approx 0.77\n   \\]\n\n\n3. **Quick Ratio**: \n   This ratio measures a companyâ€™s ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n\n   Formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n   \\]\n\n   From the balance sheet:\n   - Total Current Assets = 6951011.84 (as of 2024-01-29)\n   - Inventory = 5550000.00\n   - Total Current Liabilities = 737762.05\n\n   Calculate the Quick Assets (Current Assets - Inventory):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Assets} = 6951011.84 - 5550000.00 = 1401011.84\n   \\]\n\n   Now plug in to find the Quick Ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{1401011.84}{737762.05} \\approx 1.90\n   \\]\n\nSummarizing the results:\n- Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio = 5.72\n- Current Assets Turnover Ratio = 0.77\n- Quick Ratio = 1.90\n\nNow, we present the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Operating Cash Flow to Net Income Ratio': '5.72', 'Current Assets Turnover Ratio': '0.77', 'Quick Ratio': '1.90'}}\n```",
