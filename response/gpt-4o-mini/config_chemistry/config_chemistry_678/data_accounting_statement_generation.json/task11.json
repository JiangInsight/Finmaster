Cash Deposit: 3,000,000.00\n2. Bank Deposit: 5,000,000.00\n3. Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00\n\nTotal Initial Assets = 3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = **13,000,000.00**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Final Total Assets\n\nNext, we need to consider the transactions during the reporting period that affect total assets. We will include all purchases, sales, and any depreciation or expenses that affect assets.\n\n#### Consider all transactions related to assets:\n\n1. **Purchases**: \n   - Purchase (Chemical Product C): 800,000.00\n   - Purchase (Chemical Product D): 3,000,000.00\n   - Purchase (Chemical Product C): 220,000.00\n   - Purchase (Chemical Product C): 450,000.00\n   - Purchase (Chemical Product D): 1,500,000.00\n   - Purchase (Chemical Product A): 70,000.00\n   - Purchase (Chemical Product A): 380,000.00\n   - Purchase (Chemical Product B): 80,000.00\n   - Purchase (Chemical Product B): 2100000.00\n   \n   Total Purchases = 800,000 + 3,000,000 + 220,000 + 450,000 + 1,500,000 + 70,000 + 380,000 + 80,000 + 2,100,000 = **8,600,000.00**\n\n2. **Sales**: \n   - Sale (Chemical Product C): 56,670.46\n   - Sale (Chemical Product D): 112,444.65\n   - Sale (Chemical Product D): 261,516.46\n   - Sale (Chemical Product C): 441,383.00\n   - Sale (Chemical Product C): 222,280.28\n   - Sale (Chemical Product A): 25027.24\n   - Sale (Chemical Product C): 57676.58\n   \n   Total Sales = 56,670.46 + 112,444.65 + 261,516.46 + 441,383.00 + 222,280.28 + 25027.24 + 57676.58 = **1,890,055.67**\n\n3. **Depreciation**: \n   - Depreciation = -45,745.79 which reduces total assets\n\n4. **Overall Change in Assets** = Total Purchases - Total Sales - Depreciation\n    - Overall Change = 8,600,000 - 1,890,055.67 - 45,745.79 = 6,664,198.54\n\nTotal Assets at the end = Initial Assets + Overall Change\n- Total Assets = 13,000,000 + 6,664,198.54 = **19,664,198.54**\n\n### Final Values\n- Total Assets Initial Value: **13,000,000.00**\n- Total Assets End Value: **19,664,198.54**\n\n### Result\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Assets Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Assets End Value': '19664198.54'} }\n```",
