                        "content": "To calculate the total non-current assets initial and end values based on the provided transactions, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify relevant transactions**: We need to filter out transactions related to non-current assets, specifically:\n   - Asset purchase transactions (indicated by `Purchase` entries with respect to tangible fixed assets).\n   - Initial values for fixed assets.\n   - Any depreciation recorded.\n\n2. **Calculate Initial Value**:\n   - Start with the initial values of cash deposits, bank deposits, and existing fixed assets noted at the beginning.\n   - For non-current assets, we'll add the values from purchase transactions that meet the criteria for fixed assets.\n\n3. **Calculate Subsequent Changes**:\n   - Any purchases of fixed assets (from the `Purchase` entries) will increase the total non-current assets.\n   - Any depreciation will decrease the total non-current assets.\n\n4. **Calculate End Value**: \n   - After accounting for all purchases and depreciation, we will have the end value of non-current assets.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n**Given Data:**\n- Initial values from the provided input:\n  - Cash Deposit: 3,000,000\n  - Bank Deposit: 5,000,000\n  - Fixed Assets Initial Value: 5,000,000\n\n#### Initial Value Calculation:\n- Total Initial Value before purchases or depreciation:\n  - Initial Cash + Initial Bank + Fixed Assets = `3,000,000 + 5,000,000 + 5,000,000 = 13,000,000`\n\n#### Capital Expenditures (Purchases):\n- Non-current asset purchases:\n  - **Purchase20231231001**: 800,000\n  - **Purchase20231231002**: 3,000,000\n  - **Purchase20231231004**: 130,000\n  - **Purchase20231231011**: 900,000\n\n  **Total Purchases**: \n  - `800,000 + 3,000,000 + 130,000 + 900,000 = 4,830,000`\n\n#### Depreciation:\n- **Depreciation** entries recorded:\n  - Depreciation recorded on **Depreciation20240101001**: 45,745.79\n\n#### End Value Calculation:\n- Initial Value + Total Purchases - Total Depreciation:\n  - New Total Non-current Assets = Initial Value + Purchases - Depreciation\n  - New Total Non-current Assets = `13,000,000 + 4,830,000 - 45,745.79`\n  - New Total Non-current Assets = `17,784,254.21`\n\n### Presenting the Final Answer:\nThe total initial and end value of non-current assets is presented in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Total Non-current Assets Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Total Non-current Assets End Value': '17784254.21'}}\n``` \n\nNote: The variation in values may rely on different interpretations based on other entries; however, the principles applied here allow a clear framework for accounting for non-current assets changes.",
