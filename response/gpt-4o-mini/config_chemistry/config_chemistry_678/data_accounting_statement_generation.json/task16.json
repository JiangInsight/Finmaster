All other entries relate to purchases or expenditures rather than direct capital contributions.\n\nAfter reviewing the additional entries, there are no transactions that indicate additional paid-in capital beyond the initial input, nor changes that would decrease the amount due to withdrawals or distributions to owners.\n\nThus, the Paid-in Capital remains unchanged as no new capital was injected nor was there any capital withdrawal.\n\n**Total Final Paid-in Capital:**\n- Remains at **13,000,000.0**\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculations lead us to the conclusion that:\n- **Paid-in Capital Initial Value:** 13,000,000.00\n- **Paid-in Capital End Value:** 13,000,000.00\n\n### Result in Required Format\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Paid-in Capital Initial Value': '13000000.00', 'Paid-in Capital End Value': '13000000.00'}}\n```",
