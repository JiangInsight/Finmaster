We need to sum all cash inflows and outflows. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Cash Inflows and Outflows\n\n#### Cash Inflows\n- Cash deposits: These are amounts deposited directly into the cash account.\n- Sales revenues: Any sale reported as cash indicates an inflow.\n- Interest receivables: Amounts recognized as cash income.\n\n#### Cash Outflows\n- Purchase: Any purchase paid in cash will reduce cash.\n- Expenses: Administrative and financial expenses paid in cash will also reduce cash.\n- Transfers: Cash transfers from bank to cash accounts or vice versa affect cash amounts.\n\n### Step 2: Record the Amounts\n\nGo through the dataset and mark the amounts for cash inflows and outflows:\n\n#### Cash Inflows:\n1. Initial Cash Deposit: **3,000,000.0**\n2. Initial Bank Deposit: **5,000,000.0**\n3. Sale on 2024-01-02: **56,670.46**\n4. Sale on 2024-01-03: **112,444.65**\n5. Sale on 2024-01-03: **261,516.46**\n6.
