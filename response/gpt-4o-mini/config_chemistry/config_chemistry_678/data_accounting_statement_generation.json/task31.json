We'll focus on transactions that have amounts specified; as these amounts are recorded as unpaid receivables, they contribute to the interest income.\n\n2. **Sum the amounts from interest income transactions**: We will take the amounts that are positive (not negative) and add them up to find the total interest income.\n\n3. **Account for negative amounts**: If any negative amounts are present, we can treat these as deductions from our interest income, as they represent reductions in the expected income.\n\nNow let's look into the transactions from the extracted dataset:\n\n### Extracted Interest Receivable Transactions:\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-01: 373.80\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-02: 106.80\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-03: 106.80\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-04: 95.23\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-05: 95.23\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-06: 95.23\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-07: 95.23\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-08: 61.41\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-09: 61.41\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-10: -18.69\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-11: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-12: -27.59\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-13: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-14: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-15: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-16: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-17: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-18: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-19: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-20: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-21: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-22: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-23: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-24: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-25: 16.91\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-26: 0.88\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-27: 2.66\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-28: 11.56\n- Interest Receivables on 2024-01-29: 0.21\n\n### Summation of Interest Income:\nNow, let's add these amounts up:\n- Positive amounts: \n    - \\( 373.80 + 106.80 + 106.80 + 95.23 + 95.23 + 95.23 + 95.23 + 61.41 + 61.41 + 16.91 + 16.91 + 16.91 + 16.91 + 16.91 + 16.91 + 16.91 + 16.91 + 16.91 + 0.88 + 2.66 = 942.36 \\)\n\n- Negative amounts (deductions):\n    - \\( -18.69 - 27.59 = -46.28 \\)\n\n### Final Calculation:\n- Total Interest Income = Positive amounts - Negative amounts\n- Total Interest Income = \\( 942.36 - 46.28 = 896.08 \\)\n\nIn the income statement, this results in:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Interest Income': '896.08'}}\n```",
