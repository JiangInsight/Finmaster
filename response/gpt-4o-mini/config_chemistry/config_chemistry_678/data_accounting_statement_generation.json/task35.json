COGS.\n6. **Administrative Expenses**: This compiles all administrative expenses reported in the transactions.\n7. **Selling Expenses**: This includes all selling expenses detailed in the transactions.\n8. **Depreciation**: This is taken from the transactions that explicitly list depreciation expenses.\n9. **Financial Expenses**: This encompasses all financial expenses recorded.\n10. **Total Expenses**: This is the sum of Administrative Expenses, Selling Expenses, Depreciation, and Financial Expenses.\n11. **Interest Income**: This is calculated from all recorded interests that are receivable.\n12. **Profit Before Tax**: This is calculated by subtracting Total Expenses from Gross Profit and adding Interest Income.\n13. **Tax Expense**: A predetermined amount for tax, based on your hypothetical numbers or estimates (in this example, it's assumed).\n14. **Net Profit**: This figure is calculated as: Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense.\n\nNext, I'll extract all relevant data for calculations from the provided transactions.\n\n### Step by Step Calculation:\n\n**Extract Sales and Revenue**:\n- Sales Transactions:\n  - Sale20240102001: 56670.46\n  -

Purchase amounts from various Purchase transactions that are related to products being sold.\n\n**Cost of Goods Sold Calculation**:\nCOGS = Sum of All Purchases = **8,700,000.00**\n\n**Calculate Gross Profit**:\nGross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS = 2,405,912.39 - 8,700,000.00 = **-6,294,087.61**\n\n**Extract Expenses**:\n- Total Administrative Expenses = 540,000.00\n- Total Selling Expenses = 312,000.00\n- Total Depreciation = 45745.79\n- Total Financial Expenses = 252,000.00\n\n**Total Expenses Calculation**:\nTotal Expenses = Administrative Expenses + Selling Expenses + Depreciation + Financial Expenses\n\nTotal Expenses = **540,000.00 + 312,000.00 + 45745.79 + 252,000.00 = 1,353,745.79**\n\n**Interest Income Calculation from Interest Receivables**:\nTotal Interest Income = Sum of Interest Receivables = **10,690.00**.\n\n**Profit Before Tax Calculation**:\nProfit Before Tax = Gross Profit - Total Expenses + Interest Income\nProfit Before Tax = -6,294,087.61 - 1,353,745.79 + 10,690.00 = **-7,637,143.40**.\n\n**Assuming Tax Expense**:\nTax Expense will be influenced by local laws and estimated figures can be practical.\n\n**Net Profit Calculation**:\nLet's assume there is no tax for simplicity.\nNet Profit = Profit Before Tax - Tax Expense = -7,637,143.40 - 0 = **-7,637,143.40**.\n\n### Solution\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Main Business Revenue': '2405912.39', 'Total Revenue': '2405912.39', 'Cost of Goods Sold': '8700000.00', 'Total Cost': '8700000.00', 'Gross Profit': '-6294087.61', 'Administrative Expenses': '540000.00', 'Selling Expenses': '312000.00', 'Depreciation': '45745.79', 'Financial Expenses': '252000.00', 'Total Expenses': '1,353,745.79', 'Interest Income': '10690.00', 'Profit Before Tax': '-7637143.40', 'Tax Expense': '0.00', 'Net Profit': '-7637143.40'} }\n```\nNote: These calculations are subject to the accuracy of provided data entries and tax laws applicable.
