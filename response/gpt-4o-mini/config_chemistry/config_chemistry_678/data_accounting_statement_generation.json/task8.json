Thus, the accumulated depreciation initial value is `0.00`.\n\n2. **Identify the Depreciation Entries**:\n   We need to extract any entries that are related to depreciation, looking for the type or description that indicates depreciation. \n\n   From the data, we find the following depreciation entry:\n   - **Depreciation**:\n     - **Date**: 2024-01-01\n     - **Amount**: 45745.79\n\n3. **Calculating the Accumulated Depreciation End Value**:\n   The accumulated depreciation at the end of the transactions is simply the total of all depreciation recorded up until that point. Since there's only one depreciation transaction noted:\n   - Accumulated Depreciation End Value = Initial Value + Total Depreciation Recorded\n   - Accumulated Depreciation End Value = 0 + 45745.79 = 45745.79\n\nBased on this analysis, we can formulate the answer in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'Accumulated Depreciation Initial Value': '0.00', 'Accumulated Depreciation End Value': '45745.79'}}\n```",
