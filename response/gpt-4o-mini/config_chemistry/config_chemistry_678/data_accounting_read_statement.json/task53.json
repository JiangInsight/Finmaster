This indicates that inventories decreased by this amount during the period.\n\nFrom the income statement:\n- The line `Cost of Goods Sold` (COGS) shows a value of 4680000.00. This indicates the total cost of inventory that was taken into account as sold during the reporting period.\n\nThe carrying amount of inventories sold corresponds directly to the Cost of Goods Sold for that period, as it reflects the cost of inventory that was used up to generate revenue during the defined time frame.\n\nAfter assessing this information, the essential figure regarding the carrying amount of inventories sold is:\n\n- COGS: 4680000.00\n\nThus, the solution will be presented as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '4680000.00'} }\n```",
