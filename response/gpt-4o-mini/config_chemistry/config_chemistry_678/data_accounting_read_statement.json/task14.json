These items are typically found under \"Current Liabilities.\" \n\nExamining the provided balance sheet:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**: This amount represents obligations owed to suppliers for goods and services purchased on credit. \n   - Initial amount: 0.00\n   - End amount: 450000.00\n\n2. **Taxes Payable**: This amount reflects the taxes owed to the government, which are expected to be paid in the normal course of operations. \n   - Initial amount: 0.00\n   - End amount: 287762.05\n\n3. **Total Current Liabilities**: This aggregates the amounts of the current obligations (Accounts Payable and Taxes Payable).\n   - Initial amount: 0.00\n   - End amount: 737762.05\n\nBased on this information, we need the initial and end values of the total current liabilities. \n\n- The **initial value** of Current Liabilities is **0.00** (as per the balance sheet given, at the initial date).\n- The **end value** of Current Liabilities, as computed in the balance sheet, is **737762.05**.\n\nThus, we can present the solution in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '737762.05'}}\n```",
