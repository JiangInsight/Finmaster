This is because cash and cash equivalents are typically outlined in this section as \"Beginning Balance\" and \"Ending Balance.\"\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Identify the Relevant Data**:\n   - We look at the \"cash flow\" table provided in the problem.\n   - Under this section, we are particularly concerned with the line that mentions \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\".\n\n2. **Locate the 'Beginning Balance'**:\n   - In the cash flow table:\n     ```\n     | Cash and Cash Equivalents |  | 2024-01-29 |\n     | Beginning Balance  | 8000000.00 | 2024-01-29 |\n     ```\n   - The \"Beginning Balance\" for cash and cash equivalents is specified as **8000000.00**.\n\n3. **Format the Output**:\n   - Based on the identified value, we need to present it in the specified JSON format.\n\n### Final Output:\nThus, the required JSON output would be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '8000000.00'} }\n```",
