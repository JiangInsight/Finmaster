In this case, the amount is **5755241.17**.\n   \n2. **Total Revenue**: This line usually encompasses the total sales or revenue, which is equal to the Main Business Revenue in this case. Therefore, it also amounts to **5755241.17**.\n\n3. **Cost of Goods Sold**: While this shows the cost associated with producing the goods sold, it does not pertain to income from core activities, so we will not include it in our final extraction.\n\n4. Other line items such as Gross Profit, Administrative Expenses, Selling Expenses, Financial Expenses, Interest Income, and Profit Before Tax reflect different aspects of profitability and costs rather than income from core operating activities.\n\n5. **Interest Income**: This is usually not considered core operating income as it arises from investments rather than business operations.\n\nIn summary, the only relevant line item reflecting income from core business activities is the **Main Business Revenue**.\n\nThus, according to the structure provided, the answer will be:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5755241.17'} }\n```",
