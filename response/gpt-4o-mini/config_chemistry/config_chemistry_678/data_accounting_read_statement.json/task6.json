Generally, these accounts include **Inventory** and **Fixed Assets**.\n\n1. **Identify relevant accounts**:\n   - **Inventory**: This represents items held for sale or use in production and is a tangible asset.\n   - **Fixed Assets**: This includes property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) held for administrative purposes.\n\n2. **Extract values**:\n   - **For Inventory**: \n     - Initial Amount: 0.00\n     - End Amount: 5550000.00\n   - **For Fixed Assets**: \n     - Initial Amount: 5000000.00\n     - End Amount: 5480116.37\n\n3. **Summarize values**:\n   - Total Initial Amount for tangible assets = Inventory + Fixed Assets Initial\n     - Total Initial Amount = 0.00 + 5000000.00 = 5000000.00\n   - Total End Amount for tangible assets = Inventory + Fixed Assets End\n     - Total End Amount = 5550000.00 + 5480116.37 = 11030516.37 \n\n4. **Present in the specified format**:\nBased on the instructions, we will present both the **initial value** and **end value** for Fixed Assets only as representative of the tangible items held.\n\nThus, we collect and format the final result as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5480116.37'} }\n``` \n\nPlease note, the extraction here specifically uses the Fixed Assets since it's requested that we focus on tangible items held, although the Inventory amount is a key figure as well. If Inventory is also to be included in the solution, it can be added similarly.",
