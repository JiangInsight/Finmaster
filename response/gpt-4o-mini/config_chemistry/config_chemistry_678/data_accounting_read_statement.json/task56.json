This amount represents the depreciation expense for the period and indicates the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.\n\n2. **Depreciation in the Income Statement:**\n   - The income statement also has a line item labeled \"Depreciation\" with the same value of **45745.79**. This further confirms that the value of depreciation is consistent across the financial statements.\n\nSince both pieces of information point to the same amount of depreciation, we can conclude that the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life is **45745.79**.\n\nNow, let's present the extracted value in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '45745.79'} }\n```",
