We see the entry **\"Administrative Expenses\"**, which typically includes costs related to general management and administration.\n   \n2. The corresponding amount for **Administrative Expenses** is **1082287.97**.\n\nAccording to the task, we are specifically tasked with identifying the value of costs of general management and administration, which in this case corresponds directly to Administrative Expenses.\n\nNow that we have identified the relevant line item and its value, we can present the result in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '1082287.97'} }\n```",
