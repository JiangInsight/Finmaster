This increase indicates the amount of tax that has accrued but has not yet been paid.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the specific value of the increase in the amounts of tax accrued but not yet paid is 287762.05.\n\nNow, I'll format this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '287762.05'} }\n```",
