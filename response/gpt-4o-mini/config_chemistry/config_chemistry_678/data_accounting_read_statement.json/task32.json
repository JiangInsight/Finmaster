This value represents the profit after all expenses, taxes, and other costs have been deducted from total revenue.\n\n2. **Identify the relevant sub-items:** We need to decompose the net profit into 5 relevant financial line items which contribute to the calculation of the net profit:\n   - **Total Revenue**: This is the total income generated by the business, which is shown as `5755241.17`.\n   - **Total Expenses**: This is the sum of all costs incurred, which totals `2141084.46`.\n   - **Interest Income**: This is the income from interest, recorded as `1225.71`.\n   - **Tax Expense**: This is the total tax liability, which stands at `287762.05`.\n   - **Cost of Goods Sold** (COGS): This item represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold, reported as `4680000.00`.\n\n3. **Present the values derived from the analysis:**\n   - **Net Profit Value**: `-1352379.63`\n   - **Sub-Items Values**: \n     - Total Revenue: `5755241.17`\n     - Total Expenses: `2141084.46`\n     - Interest Income: `1225.71`\n     - Tax Expense: `287762.05`\n     - COGS: `4680000.00`\n\nNow, finalizing the output in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-1352379.63', 'sub_items_sub_item value1': '5755241.17', 'sub_items_sub_item value2': '2141084.46', 'sub_items_sub_item value3': '1225.71', 'sub_items_sub_item value4': '287762.05', 'sub_items_sub_item value5': '4680000.00'}}\n```",
