The statement shows individual line items related to cash and cash equivalents.\n2. Specifically, we can see:\n   - **Beginning Balance**: This indicates the starting cash and cash equivalents.\n   - **Ending Balance**: This is the figure we want, which represents the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period.\n   - **Net Increase**: This net change in cash during the period is provided but is not relevant to our task of identifying the ending balance.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, the ending balance of cash and cash equivalents is listed as:\n- **Ending Balance**: -204229.08\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the value of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period is -204229.08.\n\nNow, we will present this in the specified JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '-204229.08'} }\n```",
