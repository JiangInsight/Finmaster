                        "content": "To extract the specific line items and values of costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver the goods and services to customers from the provided income statement, we'll identify relevant components that typically fall under these categories.\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** is a key figure that directly represents the costs incurred to produce the goods sold by the company. This is typically the largest direct cost item impacting gross profit.\n\n2. **Selling Expenses** are also related to costs associated with securing customer orders. This may include costs like sales commissions, advertising, and other expenses directly tied to selling the products.\n\nNow let's look at the provided income statement:\n\n| Account                  | Amount       | Date        |\n|-------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Main Business Revenue    | 5755241.17   | 2024-01-29  |\n| Total Revenue            | 5755241.17   | 2024-01-29  |\n| Cost of Goods Sold       | 4680000.00   | 2024-01-29  |\n| Total Cost               | 4680000.00   | 2024-01-29  |\n| Gross Profit             | 1075241.17   | 2024-01-29  |\n| Administrative Expenses   | 1082287.97   | 2024-01-29  |\n| Selling Expenses          | 463643.51    | 2024-01-29  |\n| Depreciation             | 45745.79     | 2024-01-29  |\n| Financial Expenses        | 549407.19    | 2024-01-29  |\n| Total Expenses            | 2141084.46   | 2024-01-29  |\n| Interest Income           | 1225.71      | 2024-01-29  |\n| Profit Before Tax        | -1064617.58  | 2024-01-29  |\n| Tax Expense              | 287762.05    | 2024-01-29  |\n| Net Profit               | -1352379.63  | 2024-01-29  |\n\nFrom this, we can extract the values for the identified cost components:\n\n- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: 4680000.00\n- **Selling Expenses**: 463643.51\n\nThe total costs incurred to secure customer orders and to deliver goods and services includes both COGS and Selling Expenses:\n\nTotal Costs = COGS + Selling Expenses\nTotal Costs = 4680000.00 + 463643.51 = 5146643.51\n\nIn JSON format for the solution:\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '5146643.51'}}\n```",
