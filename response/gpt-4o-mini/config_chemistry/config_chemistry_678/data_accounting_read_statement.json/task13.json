                        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify the total assets from the balance sheet, specifically those that are not expected to be realized or intended for sale or consumption in the normal course of the entity's operating cycle. This usually pertains to non-current assets, which include fixed assets and other long-term investments. Let's break down the relevant line items.\n\nLooking at the problem statement:\n\n1. **Total Current Assets**:\n   - This category generally includes assets that are expected to be realized or consumed within one financial year. Therefore, we will not consider this for our solution.\n\n2. **Total Non-current Assets**:\n   - This category includes fixed assets and accumulated depreciation:\n     - Fixed Assets: 5,000,000.00 (initial value) → 5,480,116.37 (end value)\n     - Accumulated Depreciation: 0.00 (initial value) → 45,745.79 (end value)\n\n   These assets would typically not be liquidated in the short term and are therefore aligned with our requirement of not being intended for sale or consumption in the normal course.\n\n3. **Total Assets**:\n   - 13,000,000.00 (initial value) → 12,385,382.42 (end value) is the sum of total current assets and total non-current assets but does not provide additional details to separate current from non-current.\n\nBased on the provided information, the relevant item from the balance sheet for the question is **Total Non-current Assets**.\n\nNow, we will prepare the solution which includes both the initial and the end values of Total Non-current Assets:\n\n- **Initial value** of Total Non-current Assets: **5,000,000.00**\n- **End value** of Total Non-current Assets: **5,434,370.58**\n\nLet's format the answer as specified:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '5000000.00', 'end value': '5434370.58'} }\n```",
