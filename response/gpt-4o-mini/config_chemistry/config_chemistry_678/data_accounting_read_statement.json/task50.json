Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Systematic Allocation of the Depreciable Amount of an Asset Over Its Useful Life**: \n   - The line item here is \"Depreciation\". According to the data, this amount is **45745.79**.\n\n2. **Reduction in the Amount of Assets Held for Sale in the Ordinary Course of Business**: \n   - The relevant line here is \"(Increase) Decrease in Inventory\", which indicates the change in asset levels related to inventory. The amount listed is **-5550000.00**.\n\n3. **Net Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents Generated from an Entity's Activities Related to the Acquisition and Disposal of Long-term Assets**: \n   - This corresponds to \"Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities\", which is recorded as **-480116.37**.\n\n4. **Net Addition in the Amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents During the Period**: \n   - For this, we refer to \"Net Increase\", which shows the total increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Here, the amount is **-8204229.08**.\n\nNow compiling these values in the order specified:\n\n- value1: `45745.79` (Depreciation)\n- value2: `-5550000.00` (Decrease in Inventory)\n- value3: `-480116.37` (Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities)\n- value4: `-8204229.08` (Net Increase)\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format, we have:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '45745.79', 'value2': '-5550000.00', 'value3': '-480116.37', 'value4': '-8204229.08'}}\n```",
