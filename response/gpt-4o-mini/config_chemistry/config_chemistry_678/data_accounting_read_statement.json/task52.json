Identify the **initial value** of Paid-in Capital:\n   - According to the balance sheet, the initial amount for Paid-in Capital is **13,000,000.00**.\n\n2. Identify the **final value** of Paid-in Capital:\n   - The balance sheet also lists the end amount for Paid-in Capital, which remains as **13,000,000.00**.\n\nNow we compile this information into the required JSON format.\n\nThe solution is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '13000000.00', 'end value': '13000000.00'} }\n```",
