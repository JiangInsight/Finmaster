The line item that typically represents the cost associated with inventories sold is the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (COGS).\n\n2. **Identifying the Relevant Line Item**:\n   - From the income statement provided in the \"problem,\" the relevant line items are as follows:\n     - Cost of Goods Sold: **4680000.00**\n\n3. **Extracting the Value**: \n   - The amount for Cost of Goods Sold directly corresponds to the value of the inventories sold during the reporting period.\n\n4. **Formatting the Solution**: I need to present the answer in the specified JSON format.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value': '4680000.00'} }\n```",
