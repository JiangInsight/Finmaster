In a balance sheet context, these items typically relate to liabilities, particularly:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable** - Amount owed to suppliers for goods and services bought on credit.\n2. **Taxes Payable** - Amount owed for taxes that have been incurred but not yet paid, which could also be considered amounts owed in relation to services (government services).\n\nNext, we'll extract the initial and end amounts for these items.\n\n### Analyzing the Provided Balance Sheet\n\n#### Relevant Line Items and Their Values:\n\n1. **Accounts Payable**:\n   - Initial Amount: 0.00\n   - End Amount: 450000.00\n\n2. **Taxes Payable**:\n   - Initial Amount: 0.00\n   - End Amount: 287762.05\n\nNow we will summarize the values:\n\n- Total Initial Value owed (Accounts Payable + Taxes Payable):\n  - Accounts Payable Initial: 0.00\n  - Taxes Payable Initial: 0.00\n  - Total Initial: 0.00 + 0.00 = 0.00\n\n- Total End Value owed:\n  - Accounts Payable End: 450000.00\n  - Taxes Payable End: 287762.05\n  - Total End: 450000.00 + 287762.05 = 737762.05\n\n### Preparing the Final Output\n\nNow that we have calculated both the total initial value and the total end value of amounts owed for goods or services received or purchased on credit, we format the output in the specified JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'initial value': '0.00', 'end value': '737762.05'} }\n```",
