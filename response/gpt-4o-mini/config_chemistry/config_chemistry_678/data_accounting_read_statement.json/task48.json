The required line items are:\n\n1. \"Net Profit\" - This represents the profit an entity retains after all expenses have been deducted from total revenue. \n2. \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" - This represents cash payments to acquire property, plant, and equipment and other long-term assets.\n\nLooking into the provided cash flow statement, we can identify the required values from the lines:\n\n- \"Net Profit\" line item has the amount of **-1352379.63**.\n- \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\" line item has the amount of **480116.37**.\n\nNow, we will maintain the order of the line items as they appear in the input statement when constructing the solution.\n\nTherefore, the values we will include in the solution JSON format are:\n\n- `value1` for \"Net Profit\": **-1352379.63**\n- `value2` for \"Purchase of Fixed Assets\": **480116.37**\n\nWe present our answer as follows:\n\n```json\n{\"solution\": {'value1': '-1352379.63', 'value2': '480116.37'} }\n```",
